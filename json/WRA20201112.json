The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the Rural Transport Programme (RTP).  <\/p>  <p>  The NTA seeks to deliver an efficient, accessible and integrated public transport system in rural and urban Ireland. Public transport in rural areas of the country is primarily provided by bus and coach services, as well as rail and SPSV services (Taxi, Hackney and Local Area Hackney). The NTA funds public bus services in rural areas such as County Longford through its public service obligation (PSO) arrangements, mainly with Bus &Eacute;ireann, and also through the Rural Transport Programme, which now operates under the Local Link brand. Commercial bus operators also provide key transport services in the county including Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services 22 and 23, M4 Direct, Farrelly's Coaches and Geraghty Travel, among others.<\/p>  <p>  From a policy perspective, the Programme for Government contains a number of commitments in relation to improving public transport services in rural areas. Among the measures being prioritised are:<\/p>  <p>  - is a Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system,<\/p>  <p>  - expanding the Local Link rural transport service, and<\/p>  <p>  - prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week I published a report of a public consultation process which was undertaken by the Department between November 2019 and February 2020 on a review of sustainable mobility policy, including the issue of rural transport. I intend to develop a new policy framework for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government right across the sustainable mobility programme. Our Programme for Government commitments in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to improved services for rural areas, the NTA has undertaken a nationwide study to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country (excluding the Greater Dublin Area, Regional Cities and Large Towns) by providing better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from this study, I am advised that the NTA is starting on a two phase consultation on its proposals, titled 'Connecting Ireland';  this engagement will begin with local authority officials and other key stakeholders on the main concepts of Connecting Ireland, and will be followed by a wider public consultation in Q2 2021 on the detailed proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200056#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200056#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[35622\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200056#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position on the future of the Ballybrophy-to-Limerick rail line; and his plans to increase usage of the line.","asker":"1491","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[35623\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200056#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the way in which he plans to increase the use of public transport; and his further plans for the upgrade of the Ballybrophy-to-Limerick rail line.","asker":"1491","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 66 together.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibliity for ensuring the provision of public transport services, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann - which owns and operates the rail network - provides passenger rail services under public service obliation (PSO) arrangements with the NTA.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asks about the future of the Ballybrophy to Limerick rail line; I can assure him first of all that there are no plans for the closure of any part of the rail network.  Indeed our firm intention is to invest heavily in the quality of the network and the size of the rail fleet, in order to address capacity constraints and expand services in many parts of the country.  Initiatives such as the Cork Line Re-Laying Programme will improve journey times for passengers and increase the attractiveness of rail as a sustainable travel option.  Ambitious fleet investment programmes will also see the overall Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann fleet grow over the coming years, with 41 additional Intercity Railcar carriages currently contracted, and a further contract for up to 600 carriages over the coming decade set to be awarded in 2021.  These initiatives will help expand capacity in areas where it is badly needed and areas where future population growth and development is expected. <\/p>  <p>  However, the route about which the Deputy asks is not a route that has been struggling to accommodate large passenger numbers.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann identifies Ballybrophy to Limerick as a continually low-density route in terms of passenger numbers, although the company has, over many years, operated varying levels of services during periods of both economic growth and recession.  I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has also undertaken both national and local promotions on the route, but that such efforts have not resulted in any significant uptake and passenger numbers have remained very low.  In this context, the NTA has no plans at present to increase services on this particular route.<\/p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann promotes usage of rail services, both in national promotion and through local initiatives.  I am told that it has a number of partnerships which support this, including on the Ballybrophy-Limerick route.  The company has stated that it will continue to promote all routes and engage with local communities to seek new business opportunities and examine the potential for revisions and enhancements to timetables which will benefit specific customer groups.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy is probably aware that some track and bridge renewal works are taking place at present along the line.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann expects that these works will be concluded by this Sunday, with some bus transfers operating between Limerick and Nenagh in the meantime.  The company advises that full services are due to resume on Monday, 16th November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200056#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200056#WRA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[35653\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200056#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the correspondence he has had with the RSA on driver test cancellations; the number of cancellations there have been; if these cancellations will be prioritised when level 5 restrictions have been lifted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>My Department is in constant contact with the Road Safety Authority since the start of the pandemic regarding all of its services, the impact of Covid-19 on those services, and how they can best be maintained in the current circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, car driving tests were first temporarily suspended due to the Covid-19 in March 2020 and since resuming operations in mid-July, there has inevitably been an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog.

In light of this any testing for international travel will need to draw on resources from the private sector which are not being accessed by the HSE. <\/p>  <p>   The testing regime envisaged under the Government decision for international travel will involve increasing the private supply of testing availability in Ireland. This will include:<\/p>  <p>  - testing post-arrival (from day 5) for passengers from EU orange or red list locations; and<\/p>  <p>  - testing for departing passengers who need or wish to complete a pre-departure test before travelling to another country.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a Covid-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is the only test that is accepted for the purposes of allowing the advice relating to restricted movement to be waived. Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review, include LAMP and antigen testing. <\/p>  <p>  Shannon and Cork Airports have indicated that drive-through testing will be available today, for passengers and the public. The daa has indicated that testing at Dublin Airport by private providers can be increased within weeks. <\/p>  <p>  As there can be no certaintly that testing capacity will meet potential demand, intending passengers are advised that appointments for testing should be sought in good time before travelling.<\/p>  <p>  With Ireland currently at level 5 of the Living with Covid-19 Plan, there should be no non-essential travel of any kind within or outside of Ireland for coming weeks. The focus is on fighting the virus, and any incoming passengers must comply with Level 5 public health measures.<\/p>  <p>  Passengers from Green regions may enter Ireland without restricting their movements.<\/p>  <p>  The default for Passengers from all other countries not on the Green list is to restrict their movements for 14 days.  Since 9 November, the advice to those arriving from orange locations to restrict their movements can be waived, if they have a negative or \"not detected\" result from a  PCR test result taken up to three days before the date of departure for Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Passengers arriving from red locations from the 29 November will not be requested to follow advice to restrict movements following receipt of a negative or \"not detected\" result from a PCR test conducted at least 5 days after arrival. Such PCR tests may be obtained from private providers and should be paid for by the passenger. This provision will also be made available to arrivals from orange locations who do not avail of a pre-departure test. <\/p>  <p>  Passengers arriving from 3rd countries (i.e. outside the EU\/EEA and UK) will be subject to the same measures as for red or grey locations, including the exemptions for essential travel or functions. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also aligned with the European recommendation for categories of traveller that may be exempted from advice to restrict movements. <\/p>  <p>  My Department engages with European colleagues on an ongoing basis, through a range of European and International groupings.

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and appropriate social distancing measures across the network.  Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions.  <\/p><p>There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times for essential purposes doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.<\/p><p>The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, in light of the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the COVID-19 situation.  The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.  In addition, the Government introduced a new temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services. <\/p><p>The NTA issued a statement on their website on 20 October 2020 which says that they will look at &ldquo;particular pressure points&rdquo; in relation to public transport should the need arise, with a view to addressing them at local level.  Both the Department of Transport and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice. <\/p><p><b><i>Aviation<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><b><i>Protocol for the management of air passengers in light of COVID-19<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The &ldquo;Protocol for the management of air passengers in light of COVID-19&rdquo; was published by the Department of Transport, in consultation with the National Air Transport Facilitation Committee, which includes representatives of the aviation industry, regulators, border control and public health authorities. The Protocol, published on 21 July 2020 and updated in October, is guidance for the coordinated implementation of EASA\/ECDC &ndash; &ldquo;COVID-19 Aviation Health Safety Protocol &ndash; operational Guidelines for the Management of airline passengers in relation to COVID-19 pandemic&rdquo; (AHSP) (30, June Issue 2). The protocol has due regard to the EASA\/ECDC COVID-19 Aviation Health Protocol Guidelines and national guidance in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19.<\/p><p>The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has taken a pro-active role in promoting and ensuring that airports and airlines operate the guidelines contained in the AHSP. In addition to the AHSP, the IAA has written to each Irish airline and airport encouraging each one to participate in the EASA industry Charter for COVID-19. The Charter establishes a feedback loop from industry directly to EASA on the performance of the measures implemented, to fine-tune and improve the guidance in the light of operational experience and of the expected increase in traffic volumes. A number of Irish airlines and airports have already joined. EASA are performing an overall monitoring role in Europe and are using the information collected from multiple sources, including the charter participants, to identify areas where the protocols outlined may be ineffective or can be further improved. As such, the AHSP is a living document and the IAA expects ECDC\/EASA to publish a further revision in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>The <b>Passenger Locator<\/b>form, administered by the Department of Health, remains in place for all persons arriving into the State regardless of the &quot;colour&quot; of the location they are arriving from.  Essential transport workers continue to be exempt from completing the form.  The introduction of an online form supports an enhanced system of engagements with arriving passengers. The main purpose of the form is for the targeting of key public health messages to arriving passengers through SMS and email.<\/p><p><b><i>Testing\/EU Traffic Light System<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The Government has developed a framework around the EU &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; system, which was adopted at EU level on 13 October.  As part of this, people arriving into Ireland from EU green regions do not have to restrict their movement for 14 days. All other passengers must continue to restrict their movements for 14 days unless they are exempted essential workers. The Government also aligned with the updated list of exempted categories of traveller with essential function or need within the EU recommendation.<\/p><p>The requirement for those arriving from orange locations to restrict their movements can be waived, if they have a negative COVID-19 test result from a test taken up to three days before arrival. <\/p><p>From midnight 29<sup>th<\/sup>November, arrivals from an EU red region will not be expected to restrict movements following receipt of a negative\/not-detected result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken <i>a minimum of five days after arrival<\/i>in Ireland. This provision will also be available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a pre-departure test. <\/p><p>There are a number of COVID-19 testing technologies currently available or emerging on the commercial market. However, subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a negative result from a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is the only test result that means the passenger is not expected to follow advice to restrict movements. Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review. <\/p><p>Testing provision under Ireland&rsquo;s framework for international travel will not be provided through the public health system, but rather will be met by the private commercial sector testing supply on a user pays basis.  As the availability of testing cannot be guaranteed intending passengers wishing to avail of a test should seek an early appointment for a test in advance of travel.<\/p><p><b><i>Maritime<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>It is recognised that maritime transport plays a crucial role in the supply chain, particularly to an island nation such as Ireland.  It is essential to the continued supply of goods in and out of the country, accounting as it does, for 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s international trade in volume terms. For this reason, ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s ports, shipping operations and all the elements of that maritime supply chain continue to function is vitally important. <\/p><p>My Department has engaged regularly throughout the pandemic with key stakeholders in the maritime sector and has put in place a number of measures to ensure that the maritime sector has continued to operate across all levels of the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan. This is exemplified by the fact that not only have the majority of scheduled sailings into and out of Ireland continued during COVID-19 but a range of new services have been added in recent months, thus enabling the supply of goods and the carriage of essential workers to critical jobs along with the repatriation of citizens.<\/p><p>My Department is also continuing, with the assistance of the IMDO to monitor and assess market conditions and trends on a weekly basis.  <\/p><p>In addition to meeting regularly with key stakeholders in maritime to address COVID-19 issues, a number of key guidance documents have been published to ensure the sector has access to the most up-to-date information and advice.  <\/p><p>- The COVID-19 Agreed Protocol for International Ro-Ro Passenger Transport Services, Ports &amp;amp; Terminal Service Operators was published in July. The Protocol, which was developed in collaboration with relevant stakeholders aims to ensure a broadly consistent approach to the facilitation by maritime transport providers of a safe and gradual restoration of maritime passenger transport as countries lift travel restrictions.<\/p><p>- To assist stakeholders and the public with issues that may arise as a result of COVID-19, my Department developed a Frequently Asked Questions guide on COVID-19 related issues in the Maritime Sector. This guide is updated regularly as required.<\/p><p>A series of Marine Notices were also published on Gov.ie and circulated to a mailing list of almost 700 recipients. These Marine Notices provided information on the following: <\/p><p>- Marine Notice No. 14 of 2020 sets out the temporary measures being put in place in relation to the validity of seafarers&rsquo; documents impacted as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic.<\/p><p>- Marine Notice No. 06 of 2020 provides instructions from the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the submission of Maritime Declarations of Health.<\/p><p>- Marine Notice No. 15 of 2020 sets out temporary provisions for survey and certification of Irish ships.<\/p><p>- Marine Notice No. 16 of 2020 sets out  the  measures  that have been taken to date to protect the maritime transport supply chain, guidance that has issued to supply chain workers and other COVID-19 related updates in the maritime sector.<\/p><p>- Marine Notice No.  22 of 2020 provides details of the Passenger Locator Form. <\/p><p>- Marine Notice No. 32 of 2020 reminds domestic passenger vessels of the latest COVID-19 guidance issued.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, my Department has made arrangements to continue with the training of seafarers at the National Maritime College of Ireland by facilitating on-line examinations as well as online delivery of lectures for students at the college. Similar provisions are being made with Bord Iascaigh Mhara at the National Fisheries Colleges at Greencastle, Co. Donegal and Castletownbere, Co. Cork. In addition my Department has engaged with the National Maritime College of Ireland regarding proposed changes to online delivery to some seafarers' training courses currently approved by the Department.<b><\/b>Additionally, the MSO has continued with face-to-face oral examinations of officers for their qualifying examinations for certificates of competency. The MSO has also made arrangements with the owners of new fishing vessels and tourist vessels which are being built overseas to ensure the on-going statutory certification of such vessels.<\/p><p>Thus through regular engagement with maritime stakeholders it has been possible to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 in a timely and effective manner and ensure that maritime the sector remains operational.<\/p><p><b><i>Road Haulage<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>I wish to fully acknowledge the essential role of road transport operators and HGV drivers and the challenges facing the industry both in the context of COVID-19 and Brexit. <\/p><p>A number of measures have been implemented to date to support the road haulage sector. Many of these are still applicable today, in the context of the current Level 5 restrictions.<\/p><p>In recognition of the importance of the work of everyone involved in the supply chain, a communication was published early on, noting that every element of the supply chain helps to ensure a continuous flow of essential goods. That communication also noted that where practical, all goods should continue to be distributed to the greatest extent possible. <\/p><p>My Department also published guidance on the cleaning of HGV cabs, and that guidance is available online at Gov.ie. <\/p><p>In collaboration with the Health Service Executive and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, my Department published an important communication stressing the importance of providing access to toilet and handwashing facilities for transport workers. That communication was circulated to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Irish Petrol Retailers' Association and other key retail stakeholders to ensure a broad distribution of this important message. <\/p><p>In response to the extraordinary circumstances that we saw at the very beginning of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, my Department, in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority, introduced a temporary relaxation of the EU driving and rest time rules in March, and this remained in place for a period of time, until the end of May. <\/p><p>In relation to supply chain workers, including HGV drivers, travelling on ferries as part of their work, the health and safety of staff and passengers on board is to be protected to the greatest extent possible. In this regard, a COVID-19 agreed protocol for international RoRo passenger ships and terminal service operators has been put in place, which ferry companies worked on with my Department.  Further information is available online (COVID-19 Agreed Maritime Protocol). This protocol has due regard to the national guidance in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and maintain passenger safety and aims to ensure a broadly consistent approach by maritime transport providers to facilitate maritime passenger transport as safely as possible. <\/p><p>My Department is in frequent contact with the Irish Road Haulage Association, Freight Transport Association Ireland and other road transport stakeholders on COVID-related matters, in line with our longstanding practice of engaging with the sector. <\/p><p><b><i>Road Safety<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has responsibility for the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), National Car Test (NCT) and Certificate of Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT).

Under this dual mandate, the IAA also regulates some of its own commercial functions.  Government policy is to decouple these two roles, and as part of this reform initiative I have had engagement with the Authority. In addition my Department has ongoing engagement with IAA in relation to corporate governance and policy matters including, for example, the response to the Covid 19 crisis and Brexit.   <\/p>  <p>  Under planned structural reforms, the existing for-profit air navigation services will be separated out as a standalone commercial semi-State body, while the Commission for Aviation Regulation&rsquo;s economic and consumer affairs responsibilities will be merged with the IAA&rsquo;s remaining safety and security regulation functions.  The result will be a strong, single aviation regulator overseeing all aspects of Irish aviation. This newly reformed IAA will provide a single point of contact for all of Ireland&rsquo;s aviation regulatory requirements &ndash; for consumers, the traveling public and industry.  Draft legislation to give legal effect to these institutional reforms is being finalised, which I hope to publish soon, and the Authority is hiring a new Chief Regulator following an international recruitment process run by the Public Appointment Service.  The new Regulator will take up the position on January 1, 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  As to how the present Covid pandemic has impacted the IAA, the collapse in air traffic has had a detrimental impact on its for-profit revenue streams coming from air traffic services.  Also, in its role as regulator of aviation safety and security within the State it has had to adjust to the public health disruption caused by Covid and the operational challenges that this brings to all sectors of our society at this time. However, it is important to note that both sets of challenges are being managed.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of the EASA\/ECDC Covid-19 Health Safety Protocols, these provide important and coordinated guidance on measures to protect public health arising from air travel.  Drawing from this guidance, my Department has produced a national &ldquo;Protocol for the management of air passengers in light of Covid-19,&rdquo; which sets out a number of important measures covering the end-to-end passenger journey.   It is important to understand that the EASA\/ECDC Protocols, and the National Protocols that flow from these, are subject to regular review to ensure that they are up to date with developments.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has indicated a preference for greater harmonisation and coordination of the EU approach to international travel. It recently requested  EASA\/ECDC is to develop a a proposal for a common EU approach to testing for COVID 19 to facilitate international travel. I expect that this proposal will be put forward by EASA\/ECDC in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB00700"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[35524\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason driver testers are taking only six tests per day instead of eight; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1607","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>The Road Safety Authority (RSA) developed protocols for conducting the driving test safely during the pandemic, following detailed consideration and medical advice.

Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and public transport has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank both all operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services safely during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government's new \"Living with Covid\" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the new Plan.  The Plan provides guidance for the public about using public transport at the different risk levels;  including that wearing face coverings is mandatory, and encouraging use of off-peak services and sustainable active travel alternative options where feasible.  <\/p>  <p>  Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including frontline workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the move to level 5, the NTA and bus operators in Dublin (Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland), have re-allocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas where they were experiencing capacity issues.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since October 22nd to help mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops. Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures have also assisted in reducing passengers' wait times at stops. Currently, all available vehicles are in use, so whilst the re-allocation will ease the situation, it remains the case that there will still be instances of people having to wait for another bus. <\/p>  <p>  The NTA continues to monitor the effects of the reduction in capacity very closely in conjunction with public transport operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB04800"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[35786\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some persons who had received appointment dates for their driver theory tests during the six-week level 5 restriction period had their tests cancelled and rescheduled 18 weeks after the initial date; his views on the adequacy of this; the steps he will take to rectify this; the timeframe for it to be rectified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>The protocol for scheduling appointments is an operational matter for the Road Safety Authority in consultation with the Theory Test  service provider, and one in which I have no role.<\/p>  <p>  However, as I understand, following the closure of the Driver Theory Test service under level 5 restrictions, all appointments during this six week period have been rescheduled to the next available appointment date.  <\/p>  <p>  As I am sure you are aware, the Theory Test service was temporarily suspended in March 2020 due to the Covid 19 emergency.

However, quantitative controls on the SPSV industry have not been exercised by Government for nearly two decades. Prior to the abolition of those controls the country, and Dublin in particular, suffered from a chronic undersupply of taxis. The abolition of those controls was necessary to address these supply issues and over the past two decades this policy has served passengers well. As I do not believe passenger interests would be served by the reintroduction of quantitative controls, I do not favour imposing a moratorium on the issuance of SPSV licences at this time. In any event at the moment demand for new taxi licences is very low and I understand current application levels are a fraction of previous application levels. It is therefore unclear how preventing new applications would deliver any benefit to existing operators.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to dissolve the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, sometimes known as the Taxi Advisory Committee. This is because the Committee has played an important role in advising my Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA) on the issues facing the industry and on how to assist it through the pandemic and ensure its future sustainability. In July, the Committee submitted a report with a number of recommendations to support the industry. The report and its recommendations formed the basis of useful engagement across Government and I am pleased that many of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, such as a waiver of vehicle licensing fees for 2021, have been implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Committee, which is established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, enjoys a broad membership with members representing driver interests, dispatch operators, passenger interests, and official stakeholders such as local Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Accordingly, the Advisory Committee has been and will remain the central focus for my engagement with the SPSV sector in relation to issues affecting the sector, including the impact of COVID-19. I made my views clear on this issue when I met with taxi representatives last week. I also noted that there are a number of vacancies of the Committee which could be filled by SPSV driver representatives and I encouraged the representatives to consider applying for these vacancies.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority, as statutory regulator for the sector, will of course continue to engage with the industry and communicate regularly with individual SPSV operators in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB06000"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[35062\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB06100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the timeline for the completion of the southern relief road for Bandon, County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[35103\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200057#WRB06200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the continuation of the southern relief road bypass for Bandon, County Cork.","asker":"1545","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 118 together.<\/p><p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

This move toward evidence based, plan-led transport planning for our major cities allows for consideration of the issues highlighted by the Deputy and the potential role all modes of transport can play in addressing them. I would also note that providing this type of long-term investment framework represents international best practice in the area of transport planning.<\/p><p>Obviously all strategies and plans produced by agencies must comply with relevant Government policy.

It is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping and other social engagements. The essential nature of these services has been acknowledged a number of times by the Government in recent months, most notably in the decision to provide additional funding for public service obligation, PSO, services and the introduction of temporary funding measures for the licensed bus sector. <\/p>  <p>  These temporary funding supports have been introduced to help ease the financial pressure on operators arising from the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19. They are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months and are targeted at covering the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The supports are targeted at those classes of bus services where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention, in line with relevant State aid considerations. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering the funding support through contracts with the relevant operators.<\/p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment which operators can avail of and which remains open to new applicants until the end of the year and a Covid-19 enterprise support grant which can be put towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment.  <\/p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to rates waivers, lending facilities, equity injection and business advisory supports, all of which will help to improve cash flow. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also been tasked with developing a Business Continuity Scheme to help coach tourism businesses through this very difficult period. This scheme, which has been allocated &euro;10m in funding as part of the July stimulus package, is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing. Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors. Indeed, the travel trade has not been able to reclaim any meaningful level of lost trade over the past 6 months.  My colleague Minister of State Naughton met with the travel trade industry  as represented by the Irish Travel Agents Association (ITAA) and our Department has maintained contact with the ITAA throughout this crisis. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that, under current Level 5 Covid restrictions, travel agents and tour operators operating from business premises that customers are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing may be eligible for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).  This scheme is designed to assist those businesses whose trade has been significantly impacted or temporarily closed as a result of the restrictions as set out in the government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with COVID-19&rsquo; Plan. Detailed guidance on this scheme (which is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe) is available at www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/press-office\/budget-information\/2021\/crss-guidelines.pdf. <\/p>  <p>  Taken together with the various supports made available by Government for SMEs, I would be hopeful that these various measures will help safeguard the travel trade sector throughout the difficult months ahead so that it will be ready to trade fully again when circumstances permit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200059#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200059#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[35527\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200059#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the morning train timetable from Dublin to Cork will be reviewed in view of the fact that the first train in the morning does not arrive in Cork until approximately 9.30 am, which is of little use to those commuting for work or education purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>As the Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

Under that Scheme, funding can be provided to local authorities for the construction and improvement of non-public roads (that is roads not taken in charge by local authorities) which meet the criteria set out in the Act.  A contribution from the beneficiaries is required in all cases. <\/p>  <p>  Up to 2012 my Department did provide ring-fenced funding for this scheme. However, due to the major cutbacks in roads funding arising from the post 2008 financial crisis, it was necessary for the Department to stop providing dedicated funding for LIS in 2012 and there was no funding for LIS in that year.<\/p>  <p>  After that from 2013 to 2017, while there was no separate allocation for the Local Improvement Scheme, local authorities could use a proportion of their Discretionary grant for the Local Improvement Scheme if they chose to do so. The reason for this approach was taken was that it was considered that Councils were best placed to decide whether to concentrate the limited grant funding available on public roads or to operate a local improvement scheme for non-public roads.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2017, my colleague the Minister for Rural &amp;amp; Community Development reintroduced dedicated funding for the LIS and is continuing to fund the scheme.  In light of the significant funding being put into LIS by the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development and the need to direct resources into maintaining and renewing public roads, it was decided that the option of allocating a proportion of my Department's Discretionary grant to LIS would no longer apply from 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Rural and Community Development made an allocation of &euro;10 million available for 2020 for LIS and works under the scheme are nearing completion with full draw down of the 2020 allocation expected by year-end.

This will have immediate implications for trade flows, particularly to UK markets but also to wider EU markets via the UK Landbridge. <\/p>  <p>  All businesses that export goods to Great Britain will be subject to a range of new customs formalities, SPS checks and other regulatory requirements that do not currently apply to such exports. It is vital that all exporters take steps to understand the impacts of the new rules or processes that will govern their export activity from 1 January 2021. These steps are set out in the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan published in September 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan also sets out the detailed work that has been carried out across Government to invest in the infrastructure and systems required for these additional checks and controls for trade with Great Britain in both directions, at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and at Dublin Airport. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to trade transiting the UK to access EU markets, the UK landbridge is an important means of access to the single market, one that is favoured by traders in high value or time sensitive goods because it offers significantly faster transit times than alternative routes. As such we continue to work positively with our EU partners on addressing challenges in EU ports for traffic using the landbridge.  However, the Government has pointed out for some time now including in our 2019 and 2020 readiness plans that there will likely be delays at ports immediately after the end of the transition period, with Dover-Calais identified as a particular likely bottleneck.   <\/p>  <p>  The process for moving goods by direct ferry routes between Ireland and other EU Member States will not be subject to the new procedures and controls. This trade stays within the Single Market. Following ongoing consultation with the shipping sector, and given the responsiveness of the shipping companies during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been my Department&rsquo;s assessment that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following the end of the UK&rsquo;s transition period.<\/p>  <p>  Following a request from my Department, the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) last week published a report that reassesses Ireland&rsquo;s Maritime Connectivity, and builds on and updates previous work carried out by the IMDO by updating the 2018 Landbridge Study. This report concludes that there is more than sufficient capacity on existing services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum. <\/p>  <p>  In addition the IMDO have launched a communications campaign which encourages businesses currently moving goods to Continental Europe through the UK to ACT now - ASSESS their supply chain, COMMUNICATE their needs to their logistic or shipping company and TRIAL the direct shipping options in order to keep their business moving. I encourage engagement between traders, hauliers and ferry companies to align capacity with needs and I would encourage traders, where it is feasible to do so, to avoid the risk of disruption by moving to direct services now and not wait until after 1 January 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  The performance of the shipping industry in responding to the challenges of Covid-19 has been impressive, including with a number of new direct services to Continental Europe having been established between Irish and continental ports, during the pandemic. My Department is confident that the shipping industry serving Ireland is open and competitive, is responsive to market demand and capable of responding to any increase in demand for direct connectivity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period. Indeed we have seen recent moves by Irish Ferries and Stena to introduce revised schedules from 1 January 2021.  Both companies have indicated that they are changing and increasing their sailings to Cherbourg from January 2021. Between them there will then be a daily service available from Ireland to France resulting in a further increase in capacity on this direct Continental Europe route of approximately 15%.<\/p>  <p>  As regards air freight, the air cargo sector is fully liberalised and airlines are free to operate on a commercial basis in response to market developments internationally.  Department officials have been working closely with stakeholders in the aviation sector both in response to the imapcts of the COVID-19 crisis, and to prepare them for the changes to come at the end of the Brexit Transition period. Officials from my Department continue to engage on a regular basis with airlines, other aviation stakeholders, and with the European Commission on efforts to maintain essential supply lines, and other related issues.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan has a section on air travel with advice to businesses on what steps to take in order to be Brexit ready. This would apply to those involved in air freight, as well as passenger transport. Similar readiness preparations have been made at European level. It is not anticipated that the changed regulatory regime for aviation between the EU and the UK will have any direct impact on the movement of freight by air.<\/p>  <p>  With a view to keeping essential supply lines moving during the COVID-19 crisis, my Department also fully supported the European Commission in its Green Lanes Communications in March 2020 and again last month, for border management measures across the EU to protect health and ensure the continued availability of goods and essential services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200059#WRD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200059#WRD04600"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[35761\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200059#WRD04700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason for the ongoing maintenance, such as weed spraying, upkeep and so on, of the currently disused Rosslare Strand-to-Waterford railway line; if his Department will agree with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to continue to maintain the line on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1622","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, rail services on this line ceased in 2010 under an agreement made between the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.

This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose.

The plan confirms that we will work with packaging suppliers to ensure they play their part in reducing primary, secondary and tertiary packaging waste arising and ensuring that all packaging on the market is reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the European Union (Waste Directive) Regulations 2020 introduced a new requirement for collective Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes to &ldquo;eco&rdquo; modulate the financial contributions paid by producers. The objective of this new provision is to provide an incentive to producers to design products that contribute to waste prevention and facilitate recycling by taking into account their durability, reparability, re-usability and their recyclability.\u00a0Essentially the more the products comply with these requirements the lesser the fees on the producer.\u00a0These\u00a0provisions will be applied in a harmonised fashion across the EU. The Commission are currently developing specific guidelines which will look at recommended modulation criteria including recyclability, reusability and recycled content.<\/p>  <p>  EPR fee modulation is one of a number of economic instruments that may be used to incentivise more sustainable production and consumption patterns, with a view of developing a circular economy. My overall ambition is to significantly reduce the amount of plastic packaging placed on the Irish market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Fines","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF01200"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[36116\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if a list of environmental fines payable to the EU in 2019 will be provided; the reason for each fine and geographical area in which the fine was incurred in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is\u00a0not held in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF01450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF01425"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[35103\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF01450","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the continuation of the southern relief road bypass for Bandon, County Cork.","asker":"1545","askee":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":306,"content":"<p>Reply awaited from the Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Light Rail Projects","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF01500"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[26667\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will consider bringing forward the construction of the Luas to Finglas route in the national development plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware the current <i>National Development Plan<\/i>provided funding toward appraisal, planning and design of a proposed Luas Finglas extension.

The supports include the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which will now run into 2021, waiver of commercial rates, tax clawback, and liquidity support available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund. \u00a0<\/p><p>It remains open to airlines to engage directly with the relevant agencies concerned with a view to drawing down such supports. The amount of any funding sought by each airline would be a commercial matter for the airlines concerned.\u00a0<\/p><p>Budget 2021 provides for &euro;8.5 billion in funding for public services to address the challenges of COVID-19, and a Recovery Fund is also to be established to stimulate demand and employment, and is to be funded to over &euro;3 billion.\u00a0<\/p><p>The report of the Aviation Recovery Taskforce contains a number of recommendations relating to the provision of further support to the sector including through stimulus funding to aid recovery, and these recommendations are being considered, as appropriate, in the context of the ongoing work to manage the impact of COVID-19 on aviation and the wider economy. <\/p><p>This week, the Government agreed a revised &euro;80 million funding package for Irish aviation. In recognition of the very difficult winter season being faced by the aviation sector it\u00a0has decided to provide an extra &euro;48 million in supports for 2021, in addition to those announced in Budget 2021.<\/p><p>For the smaller regional airports of Knock, Kerry and Donegal, in addition to the &euro;21m in funding available under the Regional Airports Programme for 2021, further operational support of &euro;6m will be made available.<\/p><p>The funding package will also include an Airport Charges Rebate Scheme for January to March 2021, subject to State Aid approval from the EU Commission. This is one of the recommendations made by the Task Force for Aviation Recovery and, at an estimated cost of &euro;20m, will support the retention of core connectivity through the Winter season.<\/p><p>To better facilitate international travel, Government has decided to implement the EU &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; classification system which categorises EU Member States\/regions inside Member States as red, orange or green, based on the number of cases of COVID-19 present in that respective location. In addition to this, COVID-19 testing will also be considered to further ensure the health and safety of international travellers. Government also agreed that, in accordance with the EU Recommendation, travellers with an essential function or need should not be required to undergo restricted movement or testing while exercising this essential function.<\/p><p>In relation to airports, more specifically, supports are continuing through the Government&rsquo;s Regional Airports Programme.\u00a0 This year, the airports of Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock) are eligible to receive capital and operational funding of &euro;6 million.\u00a0 Stobart Air, along with Donegal and Kerry airports, are also benefitting from the PSO air services that operate between these two airports and Dublin.\u00a0 Furthermore, in June of this year, the Government approved funding of &euro;6.1m towards a hold baggage screening project at Shannon Airport.<\/p><p>Budget 2021 is providing &euro;31.3m to regional airports next year, consisting of &euro;21.3m for the Regional Airports Programme (Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West) and &euro;10m in capital funding for Cork and Shannon airports.\u00a0 These supports will help airports to remain viable as they continue to manage operations alongside COVID.<\/p><p><b>Travel\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>The range of Government supports are also available to the travel trade especially those introduced to help the SME sector. Where customers of such a business are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing the business premises in which the business is ordinarily carried on, as may be the case with travel agents under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, the business may qualify for the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS)\u00a0as administered by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p><b>Public Transport and Taxis<\/b><\/p><p>Up to 23<sup>rd<\/sup>October 2020, the PSO Exchequer allocation to the National Transport Authority (NTA) was &euro;537m, including &euro;12.6m to be allocated to commercial operators under the terms of their temporary contracts with the NTA.<\/p><p>In Budget 2020, and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, &euro;288.667 million was provided for PSO, including approximately &euro;8 million for Local Link rural regular services, which is in addition to &euro;14.896 million provided for Local Link under the Rural Transport Programme (RTP). This was a slight increase on the 2019 allocation.<\/p><p>It was expected that this subsidy, together with the c.&euro;100 million State payment for Free Travel, would meet the difference between the c.&euro;600 million fare revenues collected annually from passengers, and the costs of actually providing the bus and rail services.\u00a0 Following extensive engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the 2020 PSO allocation was utilised to fund the revenue shortfall arising with PSO and Rural Transport operators as a result of COVID-19.\u00a0 On 4th June 2020 Government agreed an increase in PSO subvention to enable the normal range of Exchequer-supported public transport services to continue to run for this year.\u00a0 Continuing to fund the existing PSO system will require up to a further c. &euro;460 million to year end (in addition to the c. &euro;300m already provided).<\/p><p>The Government approved temporary funding supports of up to &euro;95m on 26<sup>th<\/sup>June 2020, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months.\u00a0 The package is restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and is being targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services.\u00a0 The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering this funding support through contracts established between the NTA and the relevant operators.<\/p><p>Passenger demand for taxis and SPSV has fallen considerably as a consequence of the restrictions brought about by the necessary public health response. As COVID-19 is a national, prolonged crisis which continues to deeply impact communities, businesses, families and individuals across the country, a national response is required.<\/p><p>The recently published Budget 2021 contained further measures to aid SPSV operators. The Department will provide funding to the NTA to enable it to waive standard SPSV licence renewal fees in 2021. A\u00a0&euro;15 million scrappage scheme has also been introduced to encourage operators of older vehicles switch to electric vehicles.<\/p><p>The trading environment for self-employed individuals remains difficult. Accordingly the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will continue until 1 April 2021. Self-employed recipients, including SPSV drivers, can earn up to &euro;480 per month which still receiving the payment. Furthermore, individuals exiting that payment may avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant is a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 which can be used towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. Further details on this and other measures are available from Department of Social Protection.\u00a0<\/p><p>These measures build on the supports provided since the start of the pandemic. The NTA took action at the outset of COVID-19 to support the SPSV sector, such as\u00a0licence extensions, the waiver of late renewal feels, and facilitating the suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decided to temporarily stop working and suspend their licence. The NTA has also extended age limits for vehicles that were due to reach them since March until the end of 2020, and are currently considering extending them further until the end of 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[35781\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to support the maintenance of regional roads in County Cork in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

I understand that due to continuing travel restrictions the travel trade industry has not been able to reclaim any meaningful level of lost trade over the past 8 months. <\/p>  <p>  The travel trade is primarily an SME sector, and as such travels agents and tour operators have access to all of the various business supports made available in the July stimulus package and in last month's Budget.  Budget 2021 contains historic levels of State support for the SME sector in the form of wage supports, financial grants and waived commercial rates.  In addition, under current Level 5 Covid restrictions, travel agents and tour operators operating from business premises that customers are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing may be eligible for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).  Any queries in relation to the operation of the CRSS should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners. Taken together, I would be hopeful that these significant measures will help safeguard the travel sector throughout the difficult months ahead so that it will be ready to trade fully again when circumstances permit.<\/p>  <p>  The only meaningful solution, of course, is people booking holidays and overseas trips again.  Recent developments provide a basis to hope that the travel trade will be able to start rebuilding their business and customer base in the New Year.  Taken together, the prospect of effective vaccines, the recent agreement by the Government of the European Traffic Light System, and the new protocols around testing people travelling into and out of Ireland offer a clear pathway back to growth for the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ports Facilities","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[28438\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has considered a proposal to make Rosslare Europort a freeport as part of preparations for Brexit.","asker":"1622","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>My Department was first informed about this suggestion by Rosslare Europort in late July 2020 when the Company forwarded a short document to my Department on the development potential for available lands adjacent to Rosslare Europort which included a suggestion that a Free Zone area could be located there as well as at the port itself.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is therefore at the very early stage concept as any formal proposal would have to have a comprehensive business case setting out the analysis, pros and cons, etc.  As such, my Department has not received a detailed, formal proposal to make Rosslare Europort a freeport.<\/p>  <p>  The development of a Free Zone would be a matter falling within the broad area of industrial policy and would require liaison with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in the first instance, who have responsibility for industrial policy (including the Shannon Free Zone located adjacent to Shannon Airport) as well as with the Department of Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":328,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 126 and 127 answered with Question No. 123.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF03900"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[35867\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department has lease arrangements with co-working real estate companies; and, if so, the details of the leases, including the terms of the lease, location, price and duration.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Department has no lease arrangements with co-working real estate companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[35885\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF04300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department leases additional office space that is outside its departmental building and the estates section of the OPW; and, if so, the details of the lease, including the terms of the lease, location, price and duration.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":334,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Department holds a lease in respect of a premises used to accommodate the Irish Coast Guard Marine Rescue Sub-Coordination Centre at Valentia Co Kerry.

Small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators and small coach operators have been badly affected due to their dependence on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Limousine  and small coach operators, who are particularly dependent on overseas tourism and major events, have suffered a near total drop in demand for their services and many have been simply unable to work since the pandemic started in March.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports for affected businesses, such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, available for business whose turnover has fallen 30% and liqudity and investment measures such as the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Other measures include rates waivers and business advisory supports.<\/p>  <p>  Many self-employed SPSV operators, including self-employed limousine drivers, have been able to avail of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which will remain open to new applicants for the remainder of the year and continue to be paid until April 2021. This is an important lifeline for SPSV operators. Many may have gone back to work as the economy began to reopen only to find that subsequent necessary public health measures have once again supressed passenger demand for their services. The continued accessibility of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will provide an important safety net to operators, recognising their dependency on other sectors of the economy, notably the hospitality industry.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021 Budget has now put in place a number of substantial, sector-specific measures to support and strengthen the  tourism sector. The total funding for the tourism sector will increase in 2021 by over &euro;59 million or 36% over the initial 2020 allocation in Budget 2020 to &euro;220.9 million.

It has also engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. I remain committed to helping reduce the costs to SPSV operators, including limousine operators, and that is why my Department is providing the necessary funding to the NTA to enable it to waive annual vehicle licence renewal fees for 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Improvement Schemes","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF05300"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[35969\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200061#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated timeline for completion of upgrade works on the N2-A5 Dublin-to-Derry road; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":344,"content":"<p>As is the case for all such capital projects, the A5 upgrade scheme is subject to the planning assessment and approval process in Northern Ireland.

To deliver on this will require a whole-of-system perspective across all modes of transport &ndash; including active travel, bus, and rail.<\/p>  <p>  As referenced in the Programme for Government there is a commitment to developing, and importantly implementing, transport strategies for all of the major cities, towns and regions. This move toward evidence-based, plan-led strategic infrastructure development is in line with international best practice, allows for better integration of transport planning and land-use planning and is the means to deliver real change in our major cities.  Development of these transport strategies allows for full consideration of the potential for rail services in each metropolitan area. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 to 2035 sets out a hugely ambitious programme of improvements to the DART network which is known as the DART+ Programme and will effectively double the capacity of the rail network in the GDA. In advance of that construction is underway on 41 new carriages for the existing GDA commuter fleet which will expand capacity by around 34% as compared to today.<\/p>  <p>  In Galway, there are plans to redevelop Ceannt Station, construct new infrastructure around Oranmore Station, while a feasibility study is also currently underway in relation to improving infrastructure on the Athenry to Galway corridor.<\/p>  <p>  In Cork, the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy was published earlier this year and proposes a significant expansion of the commuter rail network in the Cork metropolitan area. In 2021 these proposals will be further progressed with the development of an implementation study.<\/p>  <p>  In Waterford Government announced this week funding to develop a new integrated transport hub on the North Quays which will include a relocated Plunkett Station, while in Limerick consultation on the draft Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy recently concluded and submissions are being considered by the NTA, a number of which I understand relate to the potential for expanded commuter rail. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to intercity services, I can inform the Deputy following a recent Transport Sectoral meeting of the North South Ministerial Council, Minister Nichola Mallon, MLA, and I both agreed that our Departments should further develop draft terms of reference for a proposed study of rail speeds, to ensure the finalised terms of reference take sufficient cognisance of the need for balanced regional development.<\/p>  <p>  I believe this study will allow for a full consideration of the strategic potential of rail, including the opportunities for high-\/higher- speed rail where appropriate.

My Department is also in regular contact with these organisations on these matters. <\/p>  <p>  Regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK negotiations, the end of the transition period will see the UK no longer applying the rules of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union. This will have immediate implications for trade flows, particularly to UK markets but also to wider EU markets via the UK Landbridge. <\/p>  <p>  Maintaining transport connectivity to support the movement of goods into and out of Ireland has remained a primary objective of Government during the current crisis, and this will continue to be the case as we near the end of the Brexit transition period.  <\/p>  <p>  The UK landbridge is an important means of access to the single market for Irish exporters and importers, one that is favoured by traders in high value or time sensitive goods because it offers significantly faster transit times than alternative routes. As such we continue to work positively with our EU partners on addressing challenges in EU ports for traffic using the landbridge.  However, the Government has pointed out for some time now including in our 2019 and 2020 readiness plans that there will likely be delays at ports immediately after the end of the transition period, with Dover-Calais identified as a particular likely bottleneck.  This is outside of our control.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, the process for moving goods by direct ferry routes between Ireland and other EU Member States will not be subject to the new procedures and controls as this trade stays within the Single Market. <\/p>  <p>  Following a request from my Department, the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) last week published a report that reassesses Ireland&rsquo;s Maritime Connectivity, and builds on and updates previous work carried out by the IMDO by updating the 2018 Landbridge Study. This report concludes that there is more than sufficient capacity on existing services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum. <\/p>  <p>  For this reason the Government is advocating engagement between traders, hauliers and ferry companies to align capacity with needs and I would encourage traders, where it is feasible to do so, to avoid the risk of disruption by moving to direct services now and not wait until after 1 January 2021.  In support of this, my Department together with the IMDO have launched a communications campaign which encourages businesses currently moving goods to Continental Europe through the UK to ACT now - ASSESS their supply chain, COMMUNICATE their needs to their logistic or shipping company and TRIAL the direct shipping options in order to keep their business moving. <\/p>  <p>  As regards air freight, the air cargo sector is fully liberalised and airlines are free to operate on a commercial basis in response to market developments internationally. Officials from my Department continue to engage on a regular basis with airlines, other aviation stakeholders, and with the European Commission on efforts to maintain essential supply lines, and other related issues.<\/p>  <p>  It is not anticipated that the changed regulatory regime for aviation between the EU and the UK will have any direct impact on the movement of freight by air.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200062#WRG05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200062#WRG05200"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[36095\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200062#WRG05300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to assist the airline industry to operate between all European countries, keeping in mind the need to observe Covid-19 restrictions but facilitating necessary travel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":396,"content":"<p>The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy.

In addition, officials in my Department remain in close contact with aviation stakeholders to support their Brexit readiness.<\/p>  <p>  The daa has been working on facilities and signage for passengers arriving from the UK into Dublin and Cork airports, and the OPW, along with several other Departments, has installed a Border Control Post in Dublin Airport so that goods, such as agricultural and medical, arriving from the UK can be checked and cleared by Customs, Health and Veterinary officials. <\/p>  <p>  As regards planning for the longer term,  my Department had commenced scoping work on a revised National Aviation Policy.  However, Covid-19 has fundamentally changed the aviation landscape. Significant uncertainty remains on how long the pandemic will last and when aviation might return to pre-Covid-19 levels. The National Aviation Policy will be revisited in the future once the Covid-19 recovery picture is clearer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200062#WRG05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":400,"content":"<p>Question No. 153 answered with Question No. 148.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200063#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[36098\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200063#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to encourage increased use of the commuter rail services in County Kildare with a view to alleviating road traffic congestion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>As the Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>The CRSS was announced on Budget day and the operational details are being worked though as quickly as possible.  The scheme will be implemented by the Revenue Commissioners who have shown as an organisation that they are very effective in operating schemes to support businesses in this crisis. Revenue have been accepting registrations for the scheme since 1 November, and claims will be accepted from mid-November with payments made shortly thereafter.<\/p><p>The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.<\/p><p>Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme.  Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.<\/p><p>Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. <\/p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as an outside caterer or an events company, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) or a business in the tourism sector carrying on a trade consisting of, for example, the operation of a gallery or other cultural attraction, located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.<\/p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.<\/p><p>It is not sufficient that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.  <\/p><p>I would also point out that the CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.<b><\/b>Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support  particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.<\/p><p>Businesses may also be able to benefit from the Live Performance Support Scheme details of which are available at www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/08aff-live-performance-support-scheme\/. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200063#WRH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax","counter":426,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200063#WRH02400"},{"type":"question","counter":427,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[35825\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200063#WRH02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review correspondence (details supplied) regarding the local property tax; if his attention has been drawn to the change; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":428,"content":"<p>Revenue provides a wide range of phased and single payment options for Local Property Tax (LPT).

Having said that, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  <\/p><p>In this respect, I am aware that earlier this year a company active in the Irish market ceased offering commercial liability insurance, and that this decision would have impacted certain private nursing homes.  Unfortunately, the Government cannot compel insurers to provide insurance products that they, for commercial reasons, have chosen to discontinue.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to prioritise reform of the insurance sector with particular emphasis on motor, public, and employer liability insurance. This insurance reform agenda will be driven by the recently established Insurance Reform Sub-Group of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment, chaired by An T&aacute;naiste. This Sub-Group also includes Ministers McGrath, McEntee, and O&rsquo;Gorman, together with Ministers of State Troy, Fleming and myself, as standing members. I strongly believe that this Sub-Group provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance through a cross-Governmental response.  It has recently met and is currently developing an action plan of key deliverables in line with the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>Work is also underway in relation to increasing market transparency, including through the planned expansion of the scope of the NCID to include employer and public liability insurance; reviewing duty of care legislation; providing for the Judicial Council&rsquo;s accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent <i>Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions<\/i>, with a view to presenting options for progressing this by the end of the year; looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; and making proposals on increasing competition in the Irish insurance market.  It is my hope that the Sub-Group should be able to report on progress in relation to these before the end of the year.  <\/p><p>In addition to this work, there has been a fresh round of intensive engagement with key stakeholders. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has held meetings with the Alliance for Insurance Reform, the State Claims Agency, Insurance Ireland, Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance, the Central Bank of Ireland, and Brokers Ireland.  More recently, he has also commenced a series of meetings with the main insurers in the Irish market.  It is also his intention to meet shortly with the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland.<\/p><p>In conclusion, the Deputy can rest assured that seeking to secure sustainable competition through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland is a key priority issue for the new Government and that Minister of State Fleming and I will play a lead role to ensure that progress is made in this policy area.  Finally, for nursing homes that have queries, complaints or difficulties in obtaining insurance, Insurance Ireland operates an Insurance Information Service, which may be of assistance and can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200063#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":435,"content":"<p>Question No. 165 answered with Question No. 161.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200063#WRH03400"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[35937\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200063#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a tax amnesty in respect of accumulated holiday pay can be granted to essential workers who had no opportunity to take holidays due to Covid-19.","asker":"1460","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>Ireland has a progressive income tax system which is structured such that the more income you have, the more tax you pay.

They set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities and were developed as part of a coherent framework in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change (2008), and the report of the working group on congregated settings, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings (2011).  In 2016, under Rebuilding Ireland the Strategy was extended to allow it to continue to achieve its aims. <\/p>  <p>  The Strategy has nine Strategic Aims including a key measure which was the establishment in each local authority area of Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs). The Steering Groups are the most critical fora in which people with disabilities can influence the delivery of housing in their local areas and includes representatives of key disability organisations as well as the local authority, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the voluntary housing sector. The Groups are tasked with the preparation of a Strategic Plan for delivering housing for people with a disability in their areas by identifying current need as informed by the local authority Housing Waiting Lists, the emerging need over the currency of the Plans and the setting of targets for delivery under each of the social housing solutions available. The Strategic Plans which form a part of the local authority Housing Services Plans provide the local authority and other housing providers with information that helps to inform and guide the provision of suitable housing options for people with a disability over the five-year period of the Plan. As a number of these Plans date from 2016 they will be reviewed in 2021.  The Housing Agency supports local authorities in the operation of the Steering Groups and provides training to the membership of the Groups to ensure that they fulfil their role as envisaged in the NHSPWD.<\/p>  <p>  At national level the Housing Agency drives the Strategy primarily through its Housing Subgroup which was established to support the effective implementation of the Strategy and to facilitate a uniformity of approach at local level.  The membership of the Group includes representatives of disability organisations who input into the annual work plan of the Group.  Since 2011 the Group has been involved in a number of initiatives under the Strategy including the putting in place of a project for the transfer of people with a low-to-medium mental health need from HSE care to community living with supports. In addition, the Group was centrally involved in the drafting in 2014, and the revision in 2017 of the National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Social Housing Provision for People with a Disability which are an invaluable tool for local authorities in the assessment of housing applications from people with a disability and could not have been completed without the input of people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  People with disabilities are also represented on my Department's Implementation Monitoring Group for the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability which reports annually on progress under the Strategy and are also represented on a Disability Consultative Committee chaired by my Department which monitors progress in my Department on the Actions in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, which includes housing for people with a disability. <\/p>  <p>  The National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability will be reviewed in 2021. The Advisory Group will include representatives from the disability groups and part of the work of the Group will be to ensure that the voices of people with a disability are heard effectively in relation to housing provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200065#WRK05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homelessness Strategy","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200065#WRK05200"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[35993\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200065#WRK05250","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the accessibility of existing homeless services for persons with disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[36079\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200065#WRK05275","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will commission an independent review of homeless services in order to ensure they are meeting the required standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 217 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the statutory role of local authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.

Informed by the affordability and median price of new homes for First Time Buyers in Monaghan, which currently is approximately &euro;200,000, at present County Mongahan does not have active SSF projects.<\/p><p>In addition to the Services Sites Fund, Budget 2021 ring fenced &euro;75 million for a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage.  To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. I intend to introduce this scheme in 2021 and intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders to inform the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.<\/p><p>Other measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.As part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus plan, an enhanced version of the Help-to-Buy scheme was announced. This will allow first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available at www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/help-to-buy-incentive\/index.aspx. <\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build.  This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p><p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. <\/p><p>  A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie\/housing\/social-housing\/other\/social-housing-support-table-income-limits. <\/p><p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. <\/p><p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. <\/p><p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

The all island economy and the protection of North South economic and social cooperation continue to be at the heart of our approach. This is not just about ensuring frictionless trade; it is also about facilitating peoples&rsquo; lives and livelihoods. Fundamentally, this is about peace, reconciliation and prosperity. <\/p>  <p>  The Protocol was the result of long and difficult negotiations and represents a fair and balanced outcome for all parties. There have been compromises on all sides.<\/p>  <p>  It is key now that the Protocol is implemented in full and in good faith, as a matter of urgency. The full and effective implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement is absolutely central to securing an agreement between the EU and the UK on a future relationship. <\/p>  <p>  With our EU partners, we continue to urge the UK to move forward urgently on operationalising all aspects of the Protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200066#WRL02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200066#WRL02800"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[35849\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200066#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the Passport Office has ceased processing passports for children during level 5; and if this renders it impossible for families with children who need a new passport from exercising their right to travel in which they honour all due restrictions for the destination.","asker":"1549","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>The Passport Service has paused processing of routine applications as Ireland is at Level 5 of the National Framework for Living with COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service continues to provide an essential, emergency passport service at this time for Irish citizens, including children, at home and abroad.

This follows the July European Council Conclusions on the MFF\/Next Generation EU package which stated that a regime of conditionality to protect the budget and Next Generation EU will be introduced, that the Commission will propose measures in case of breaches for adoption by the Council by qualified majority, and that the European Council will revert rapidly to the matter.<\/p>  <p>  The Presidency tabled a compromise proposal for a Regulation in September which led to difficult discussions as a number of Member States strongly support the use of protective measures, while others oppose such measures or wish to limit them to very specific breaches as they affect the EU budget.<\/p>  <p>  The mechanism agreed with the European Parliament will require Member States allocated funding from the EU&rsquo;s budget, including the Recovery Fund and grants or loans, to respect the rule of law which is an essential precondition to comply with the principles of sound financial management enshrined in Article 317 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. It sets out examples of what constitutes breaches of rule of law, including endangering the independence of the judiciary, and the procedure that will apply and possible measures to be taken against a Member State found in breach, including suspension of funding, a requirement for early repayment of loans and a reduction of funding to it under existing commitments. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the agreement reached with the European Parliament, as Rule of Law conditionality has been an important issue for Ireland in the wider MFF negotiations. The agreement means that there will be consequences for Member States for breaches of rule of law and it signals that rule of law issues are important for the EU.

The EPF is seen as a global instrument and will, in particular, expand the geographical scope of the African Peace Facility. <\/p>  <p>  While discussions are on-going at EU level to finalise the provisions of the mechanism, it is expected that this mechanism will be operational in 2021.  Member States contributions to the new mechanism will be based on a gross national income (GNI) distribution key.  Ireland's GNI distribution key is expected to increase in 2021 to reflect the impact of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has responsibility for the Athena Mechanism.  Under the proposed EPF, funding for Athena will remain in a separate pillar within the framework of the EPF and will be expanded to account for additional costs associated with EU overseas deployments.  While projected out-turn for Ireland's contribution to Athena in 2020 is approximately &euro;1.7m we have no budget proposal from the EU for Athena for 2021 at this time.  <\/p>  <p>  The allocation of the &euro;5.0bn for the period 2021 to 2027 for the EPF across assistance measures (under what was the African Peace Facility) and Athena and across each of the seven years of the MFF has not yet been determined.  Also the actual drawdown of funding will be dependent on the number and scale of CSDP missions going forward, the elements of agreed common funding and agreement on the various assistance measures for partner funding.  Given these variables it is not possible to provide precise details of the annual increase in costs arising from the mechanism at this time.  Discussions continue in Brussels on the scope of the measure and the exact provisions and it would seem that that will be agreed before member States turn to consider the budget.

A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.  <\/p>  <p>  The Yellow Flag programme aims to support primary and secondary schools to become more inclusive of all cultures and ethnicities, celebrate diversity and challenge racism and discrimination.  While respecting schools' autonomy to participate in such programmes, my Department has introduced a number of measures to assist schools in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's &lsquo;Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019)' acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach at both primary and post-primary level to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.  <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. It recommended 12 actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying including identity based bullying are addressed.  National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary schools, were published in September 2013 and are being implemented in all 4,000 primary and post primary schools throughout the country. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour including identity based bullying amongst their pupils.  The procedures make clear that the definition of bullying behaviour includes identity-based bullying such as racist bullying. The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the National Traveller and ROMA Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 (NTRIS) published by the Department of Justice and Equality, which aims to improve the lives of Travellers and ROMA in Ireland, my Department has commissioned research on the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying strategy on experiences of Traveller and Roma Children. The project was developed in consultation with the Traveller representative groups. The research project has commenced and involves engagement with children and their parents and with schools.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.   The Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.  One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she\/he lives.

It is the aim of my Department that every child has access to equitable education and that each learner feels safe and happy in the school environment, at every stage. <\/p>  <p>  At post-primary level, there are a number of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate. The decision on which particular text to use rests with the school itself. They can choose whichever text best suits the context of their teaching. <\/p>  <p>  Achieving a balanced list of texts remains a challenging and worthwhile endeavour and work continues to create a broadly balanced, diverse and inclusive list every year. For example, the most recently published list of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle English is current for the student cohorts 2018-21, 2019-22 and 2020&ndash;23. This list will be reviewed in the coming months and made available to schools for the 2021-24 cohort.<\/p>  <p>  A variety of factors influence the selection of prescribed texts, including the aspiration to achieve social and cultural diversity and inclusivity, the age appropriateness of texts, the merit of the text on grounds of excellence, as well as practical factors, such as availability and cost. As prescribed lists are developed from year to year, additional factors come to the fore and influence the choices made. In addition, newly published authors are considered for inclusion. Contemporary issues and world events also impact on prescription.<\/p>  <p>  The prescribed text list working groups for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English is informed and guided by Criteria for the Selection of Texts which aims to achieve a balance between classic and contemporary texts; Irish and non-Irish authorship; seeks gender balance in authorship and representation; embraces diversity and inclusion; accessibility of texts; general suitability and comparative potential. <\/p>  <p>  Outside of these prescribed works, the decision on any additional texts to support teaching and learning rests with the school.  <\/p>  <p>  Current and previous text lists offer many opportunities to explore issues relating to racism and inclusion\/exclusion of particular groups in society. <\/p>  <p>  The text list for Junior Cycle English currently includes, for example, the novels Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe; Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman; and the play The 14th Tale by Inua Ellams. <\/p>  <p>  Other texts which offer opportunities to explore issues relating to racism and inclusion\/exclusion of particular groups in society include The Secret Diary of Anne Frank; The Cay by Theodore Taylor; Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck; To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee; Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys and the play Girl from the North Country by Conor McPherson. <\/p>  <p>  At Leaving Certificate level, the text list for English currently includes Americanah by Chimimanda Ngozi Adichie. A number of texts in translation (generally one film and one novel) are also available for study. In the spirit of embracing diversity broadly, currently, the film Mustang by Deniz Gamze Erguven, the memoir If This Is A Man by Primo Levi and the novel Out of Shadows by Jason Wallace are also available for study. <\/p>  <p>  The plays Eclipsed by Patricia Burke Brogan and Tribes by Nina Raine and the novel The Lauras by Sara Taylor explore the experiences of marginalised groups, namely women in the Magdalene laundries, the deaf community and transgender teenagers. The classic novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley offers significant scope to explore the concept of othering in society and to link it to current examples, such as the black lives matter movement.<\/p>  <p>  How best teachers can be supported in approaching potentially controversial topics (such as those that are very topical in the media at present) always form an important part in discussions in relation to prescribed texts and will continue to do so. In our increasingly diverse society, it is crucial that students see their own story reflected in their learning and teachers should be supported in planning and developing quality learning opportunities that are contextualised to the students sitting in their classrooms. Communication from students as to their experiences in the classroom are very welcome and help shape the support we can offer to teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200067#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200067#WRM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[36000\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200067#WRM05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department or an agency operating under her Department has encountered expenditure in respect of hand sanitisation products or other PPE products that were subsequently subject to a recall by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2020; if so, the expenditure in respect of such products; if the expenditures will be recouped from the sellers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":682,"content":"<p>On 22 October 2020 the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine notified my Department that it had removed ViraPro hand sanitiser from the product register.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.<\/p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  <\/p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: <\/p><p>-2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  <\/p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not necessary for this process.  <\/p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The school had an enrolment of 166 pupils in 2019\/20.<\/p>  <p>  - St. Finian&rsquo;s Community College, Swords &ndash; architectural planning has commenced to construct a major building project at the school, which when completed, will provide capacity for 1,000 pupils. The project has been devolved to Dublin Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board (DDLETB) for delivery. A number of significant issues have unfortunately arisen, including delays in obtaining statutory consents from the local authority and delays in the finalisation of the detailed design process for the project as it was originally approved.  Based on the report provided by DDLETB, it was agreed at a recent meeting between the Department and DDLETB that this project should be redesigned. The first step in this new plan is the execution of a Service Level Agreement between the Department and DDLETB and this process in under way. Thereafter, DDLETB will procure a Design Team to design the buildings, obtain the necessary statutory planning permissions and move the project onward to construction in due course.<\/p>  <p>  - Loreto Secondary School, Swords &ndash; my Department proposes expanding this school to provide capacity for 1,000 pupils.

This was necessary in order to meet the State&rsquo;s obligations to persons seeking international protection.  It is important to note that protection applicants accommodated in such accommodation premises receive all services and allowances as those accommodated in dedicated centres.<\/p>  <p>  Emergency accommodation providers essentially provide a room and full-board service to protection applicants. Dedicated acccommodation centre operators must provide additional support and liaison services and these services, and the requirement for inspection, are contractual obligations for the contactors. One of the most important services which is required is the establishment of a local Friends of the Centre Group to address recreational, cultural and integration needs of residents. <\/p>  <p>  Emergency accommodation providers cooperate with IPAS in the delivery of clinics for residents, currently being provided remotely, and resolution of any complaints from protection residents including dietary requirements and access to local services.  They liaise with IPAS in respect of any issues that residents may have which they cannot themselves resolve.<\/p>  <p>  Residents of both the dedicated centres and the emergency premises are required to comply with the IPAS House Rules and Procedures but residents of emergency premises must also comply with the standard house rules of the commercial operators.  In most cases such rules are required under law for the operation of commercial residential accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the emergency centres also continued to provide accommodation to other paying guests.  However, in order to better protect the international protection residents, IPAS moved to secure such accommodation premises for the exclusive use of IPAS clients.<\/p>  <p>  The inspection process operated by IPAS for dedicated accommodation centres is to ensure adherence to the contractual obligations of contractors.  As noted already emergency accommodation providers do not have these contractual obligations.  Such premises are required to be compliant by law with health and safety regulations and planning requirements and may be subject to inspections by a range of authorities in this regard, including the relevant Local Authority, the Environmental Health Office of the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority. In addition Bord Failte, as the body responsible for ensuring that accommodation standards meet visitor needs, sets the requirements for the various categories of tourist accommodation and provides for processes for the regular monitoring of the standards in hotels and all other forms of approved accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Regular visits are made to all emergency accommodation centres by IPAS and any issues that arise are brought to the attention of the accommodation provider for resolution.  In addition, all accommodation premises may also be visited by a range of other bodies, including the UNHCR, the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children, civil society organisations and charities. Where issues are brought to the attention of IPAS by such bodies it is endeavoured to resolve them quickly. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to ending the Direct Provision system and replacing it with a new International Protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach.

The amount procured for this year is almost double the amount administered last season in Ireland. Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer have not been as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines. <\/p>  <p>  The fourth round of vaccine distribution to GPs and pharmacists which was completed on 11 November will bring to 1.3 million the total number of injected doses distributed.

However, this is the first season that the nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children aged 2-12 years is available. <\/p>  <p>  The number of doses available for pharmacists was based on their usage of adult flu vaccine as an indication for their first delivery of LAIV. Pharmacists were automatically allowed to order the same amount for subsequent deliveries every fortnight, but were allowed to request an increase in the amount for every subsequent delivery if they had demand for the vaccine. To date 75% of 600,000 doses purchased by HSE have been delivered to sites. <\/p>  <p>  Demand for the flu vaccine this year is unprecedented.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact.

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases).  <\/p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. <\/p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed. <\/p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.<\/p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Joint Committee's recommendation regarding the establishment of an independent inquiry into the use of valproate medicines in Ireland, there are no plans to hold such an inquiry at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200072#WRR05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council","counter":973,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200072#WRR05400"},{"type":"question","counter":974,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[36061\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200072#WRR05500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding the recognised institutional member on the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council; his plans to appoint an educational nominee from the National Ambulance Service when it comes to personal selections later in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":975,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the composition of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council is determined by article 5 of S.I. 109 of 2000, as amended.

This was more than double the biosector&rsquo;s 19% share (almost &euro;16 billion) of merchandise exports in that year.

Although food retail demand increased, it did not offset the decline in food service demand, which experienced a near-total collapse due to the shutdown of the hospitality sector across Europe and beyond. That demand imbalance had and is still having significant consequences for primary producers and agri-food businesses.

This year a particularly virulent form of the disease, known as Highly Pathogenic AI (HPAI) with subtype H5N8, has been confirmed in several species of wild birds on mainland Europe. There have also been confirmed cases in poultry flocks in the Netherlands, Germany and one in Cheshire in the UK. The virus can spread from the wild bird population to poultry farms, through direct contact and in particular through faeces from wild birds infected with the virus. While this subtype can cause serious disease in poultry and other birds, no human infections with this virus have been reported world-wide and therefore risk to humans is considered to be very low.<\/p>  <p>  The risk of incursion of highly infectious and economically damaging diseases, such as HPAI, can be reduced through the practice of effective biosecurity at farm level. If consistently applied, biosecurity measures will help prevent disease, whether exotic to or endemic in Ireland, from entering a farm and from spreading within a farm.  The strategy emphasises the importance of good biosecurity in protecting and improving animal health and welfare as well as contributing to good public health outcomes. The strategy will provide a road-map that seeks to ensure that good farm biosecurity is consistently practiced by all farmers at all times, and not just in the face of an immediate risk of a disease outbreak.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is in close contact with industry stakeholders in relation to the strict bio-security measures are necessary to prevent the introduction of avian influenza into poultry and captive bird flocks. Flock owners are urged to remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks, and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Veterinary Office. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a National Farmed Animal Biosecurity Strategy, which will be launched before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sheep Welfare Scheme","counter":1044,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1045,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[35909\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a matter regarding the sheep welfare scheme (details supplied).","asker":"1581","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1046,"content":"<p>The Sheep Welfare Scheme was launched in December 2016, for a period of four years.

The national forest estate is an important store for carbon, estimated at over 312 million tonnes.  Ireland&rsquo;s total forest area is not a net emitter of greenhouse gases and is a substantial sink for carbon dioxide compared to other land uses.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation EU Regulation 2018\/814, Ireland, like all EU Member States, had to submit a National Forestry Accounting Plan which sets out the emissions and removals resulting from older forests. These forests for the purposes of greenhouse gas accounting under the regulation are referred to as &ldquo;managed forest lands&rdquo;. The regulation also requires that a forest reference level is set for the period 2021-2025. This reference level is needed in order to account and report greenhouse gas changes from 2021-2025 against this land category. Ireland&rsquo;s forests in this category include all forests that are older than 30 years of age during the period 2021-2030. While the Managed Forest Lands (MFL) area, because of particular circumstances and timing, will be a small emitter over the upcoming period, the amount in question will be far outweighed by what the rest of the forest estate is storing and sequestering. <\/p>  <p>  The forest reference level is based on the continuation of sustainable forest management, as documented in the period from 2000 to 2009 with regard to dynamic age-related forest characteristics in national forests, using the best available data. It is the intention to continue to manage these forests sustainably and based on harvest levels outlined in the long term round wood production forecast. Roundwood production will increase over the next number of years as forests mature and replanting takes place. <\/p>  <p>  The important point to note is that the entire forest estate under long term projections is and will remain a net sink for carbon dioxide up to 2050 as outlined in the National Forest Accounting Plan. Detailed modelling, projections and sensitivity analysis will be required to estimate carbon removals post 2050 in conjunction with the level of harvest, afforestation and deforestation in the coming decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nitrates Action Programme","counter":1062,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[35968\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans in respect of the nitrates derogation review; his engagements with EU representatives in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1064,"content":"<p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is the lead authority for the Nitrates Regulations (SI 605 2017).

Therefore, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021.<\/p><p>The details of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalised and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":1075,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1076,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[35863\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111200074#WRT03800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if her Department has lease arrangements with co-working real estate companies; and, if so, the details of the leases, including the terms of the lease, location, price and duration.","asker":"1489","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1077,"content":"<p>My Department currently only occupies office space at two locations - Trinity Point, Dublin 2, and Government Buildings, Ballina, Co.
