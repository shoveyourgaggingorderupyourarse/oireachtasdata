Any interference by me would be highly inappropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of providing protections to consumers whose loans are part of loan sales, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) forms part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.   The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.<\/p>  <p>  Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013, and the SME Regulations.  Contractual terms are not changed by the sale of the loan.<\/p>  <p>Over the last number of months, there has been a lot of concern regarding loan sales. Arising from this, Deputy Michael McGrath published a Bill, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) (Amendment) Bill 2018, on the regulation of loan owners. Committee Stage is scheduled for this Thursday, 12th   July.  The approach taken with this Bill will require that loan owners are authorised by the Central Bank. <\/p>  <p>  In February this year, I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank and requested that they carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible and this is currently underway and to be completed as soon as practically possible.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, issues relating to Rebuilding Ireland and Mortgage to Rent are a matter for my Government colleague Eoghan Murphy T.D.

However, you should note that neither the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank nor I can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  <\/p>  <p>  Policy in relation to the NCT lies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  A valid NCT is generally a minimum requirement in order for an insurer to provide cover.  It is however not the only rating factor taken into account in the provision of motor insurance, therefore just because a car has a valid NCT does not automatically mean that an insurer will offer cover.  In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers will also use a combination of other rating factors, which include the age of the vehicle, as well as the type of vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurers will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to the age of a vehicle and the availability of cover, different insurers will use different age thresholds.  <\/p>  <p>  Department officials have been engaging with Insurance Ireland in relation to the availability and cost of insurance for older cars, and have been informed that certain insurance providers have recently changed their acceptance criteria and increased their vehicle age threshold levels.

I am advised also that Revenue conducted a random National Sampling Programmes in 2016 and 2017 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The programmes each involved nearly one in ten of the some 2,500 holders of auto fuel trader licences, and tests of diesel samples taken from the randomly selected traders found no evidence of the new marker in any of them. The results of these sampling are a clear indication that Revenue&rsquo;s actions have resulted in the near elimination of the selling of laundered products at retail level. A further sampling programme, in 2018, was expanded to include hauliers and other businesses in the transport sector and the data are currently under analysis.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue acts against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade, so that the illicit products involved can be seized and those responsible for smuggling or supplying them can be prosecuted. A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and the risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages is used to intercept illicit products. Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. This action has achieved considerable success, with the seizure in 2017 of 34 million cigarettes and 1,768 kilograms of tobacco.  In March this year a joint operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na led to the closing down of a major illicit cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, County Louth.

I am awaiting receipt of this report and, in the meantime, I have also commissioned an independent reviewer with significant experience of civil service bodies and operations to assess the current position and advise how best to address the TAC's resource needs going forward.  This review has been expedited in order that resourcing decisions, based on a sound business case for the resolution of the current backlog, can be made as soon as possible.<\/p><p>I do not doubt that the Commission requires an increase in resources to fulfil its envisioned purpose. However, as Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, I must ensure that any public funds granted to the Commission will go towards alleviating the backlog of appeals in a cost efficient and effective manner.<\/p><p>The recommendations of the reviews currently ongoing will inform my decision making on the Commission&rsquo;s request for resources. I am conscious that an effective tax appeals system is an essential part of a fully functional tax administration system, and it is my intention to ensure that the TAC is appropriately resourced and structured to fulfil its function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100078#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100078#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[31035\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100078#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the implementation of the recommendations made in the report by the working programme on reducing the cost of motor insurance; the number of recommendations that have not been implemented to date; the reason for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[30967\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100078#WRC03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the implementation of the report on the cost of insurance working group for motor insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 97 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out in an Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>In line with the commitment to publish quarterly update reports on the implementation of the recommendations of the Motor Report, the Working Group has published five such updates, most recently on 11th   May last.

This is the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of the sale of distressed mortgages, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) has tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address the challenge posed by the elevated level of non-performing loans across the Irish banking system. Despite progress made over the last few years, the level of such loans in Ireland remains well above the European average.  The sale of distressed loans is one of the ways in which banks are able to address this issue.  <\/p>  <p>  The role of running these sales processes, including the selection of the successful bidder, is entirely the role and responsibility of the board and management of whatever Bank in question.  Any interference by me would be highly inappropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of providing protections to consumers whose loans are part of loan sales, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) forms part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.   The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.<\/p>  <p>  Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013, and the SME Regulations.  Contractual terms are not changed by the sale of the loan.<\/p>  <p>Over the last number of months, there has been a lot of concern regarding loan sales. Arising from this, Deputy Michael McGrath published a Bill, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) (Amendment) Bill 2018, on the regulation of loan owners.

The approach taken with this Bill will require that loan owners are authorised by the Central Bank. <\/p>  <p>  In February this year, I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank and requested that they carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible and this is currently underway and to be completed as soon as practically possible.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, issues relating to Rebuilding Ireland and Mortgage to Rent are a matter for my Government colleague Eoghan Murphy T.D.

It allows for losses incurred in the course of business to be taken into account when calculating the business&rsquo; tax liabilities on certain profits incurred in other accounting periods. Loss relief for corporation tax is a long standing feature of the Irish Corporate Tax system and is a standard feature of Corporation Tax systems in all OECD countries.   <\/p>  <p>  Prior to 2014, section 396C of the TCA 1997 restricted loss relief for NAMA participating institutions, such that only 50% of taxable profits in a given year could be sheltered by losses carried forward. However by Finance Bill 2013 this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose as, subsequent to its introduction, the State had acquired substantial holdings in the banking sector and, as a result, the restriction was deemed to be acting against the State's interests. The restriction was therefore lifted in Finance Bill 2014, putting the remaining NAMA participating banks in the same position with regard to loss relief as other banks, and companies in other sectors, operating in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, changing how tax losses are currently treated for Irish banks, including those that were bailed out by the State, may well have consequences that would make it difficult for me to fulfil other objectives in respect of the Irish banking system.  There would be a material negative impact on the valuation of the State's investments from any change in tax treatment of accumulated losses where the banks are concerned. It is critically important to understand that the State is actually getting value today from these tax losses through our share sales. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted however that the banks are contributing to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy introduced in 2013, in recognition of the part that the banks played in the financial crisis. The annual revenue to the Exchequer from the levy is approximately &euro;150 million and the levy was extended to 2021 in Budget 2016. <\/p>  <p>  At Committee Stage of Finance Act 2017, I agreed that my officials would produce a report on the effect of limiting tax reliefs on losses carried forward for banks, with the stipulation that the policy outlook I will adhere to is the maintenance of the current position with regard to loss relief and the generation of Exchequer revenue via the financial institutions levy.

No. 142\/2016). In some cases, the same advertisement may have appeared across all formats of advertising reviewed. <\/p><p>As a result of the review, the Central Bank instructed lenders to withdraw or amend c.75% of the advertisements included.

The changes are being made by way of an Addendum to the Code which will take effect from 1 January 2019. <\/p><p>In relation to incentives such as cashback offers, from 1 January 2019 the existing provision 6.12 in the Code will be extended to apply the same protections to all mortgage holders i.e. for new, existing and switching mortgage holders. This is to ensure that consumers have sufficient clarity about the precise nature and scale of the benefit of an incentive to them, including the potential impact of an associated incentive on the cost of their mortgage. Provision 6.12 of the Code requires lenders to provide consumers with information needed to consider the incentive offered.

These restrictions also apply to all staff of the banks regardless of the country in which they work and as such the bank cannot use variable pay as a retention mechanism in the UK, US and Europe even in business lines where this would be the norm.<\/p>  <p>  The restrictions not only limit total remuneration for staff in AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB to &euro;500,000 (excluding a standard pension contribution).

These include no new fringe benefits, no new commission or incentive schemes and restrictions over contractual arrangements with staff on termination that provide compensation.<\/p>  <p>  As you will know I voted against a remuneration resolution at the AIB AGM in April and abstained from a resolution at the Bank of Ireland AGM.

To do so would compromise a borrower's capacity to repay his or her debts to NAMA and would constitute a direct breach of the borrower's property rights, protected under Article 43 of the Constitution.

As the Deputy will be aware, the Report on Local Public Banking in Ireland has now been approved by Government and was published last week. <\/p>  <p>  The Report contains a detailed analysis of a proposal for a possible means of implementing the German Sparkassen model of local public banking in Ireland. This proposal was provided by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Bank Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), who are the international development wing of the Sparkassen Group. Officials from my Department and Minister Ring&rsquo;s Department met with representatives from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC to discuss their proposal on numerous occasions. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the report found that there is not a compelling case for the State to establish a new local public banking system in Ireland in the proposed form. The proposal was for 8-10 local public banks, starting with a pilot local public bank in the Midlands. There are a number of challenges relating to the assumptions underlying the business model for a local public banking system that was proposed in the report. These include assumptions regarding the estimated total cost to the Exchequer and estimated interest rates and loan attrition rates. Similarly, the suggested locations in the proposed pilot in the Midlands would overlap with existing banks, credit unions and post offices. <\/p>  <p>  The cost to the Exchequer for the proposed new model is estimated at a minimum of &euro;170 million. The Government is committed to reducing its shareholding in the banking sector and encouraging a more competitive, private market. There is, however, no impediment to any interested parties separately pursuing the establishment of a system of local public banks, in a manner that does not involve Exchequer funding or State ownership. Indeed, the Government would encourage any potential new market entrants to engage with the Central Bank of Ireland and the Department of Finance in relation to this matter. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to continuing to engage with interested parties and stakeholders, such as Irish Rural Link, further on this issue by way of a stakeholder forum.

The budget for the Commission almost quadrupled between 2014, when the budget for the Office of the Appeals Commission was &euro;477,000, and the agreed TAC budget for 2018 of &euro;1.626 million. <\/p><p>The TAC has also recently moved to new office premises that afford both better hearing facilities to allow multiple hearings to proceed in parallel and more office space to accommodate increased staff numbers.<\/p><p>In February 2018, the Accounting Officer of the TAC submitted a request to my Department for significant additional administrative staff and resources to meet the increased caseload of the TAC. Granting this request would involve an effective doubling of the TAC&rsquo;s budget for 2018 from &euro;1.626 million to an estimated &euro;3.226 million. This request includes extra resources for ICT and infrastructure in the TAC's new office space.<\/p><p>Due to the substantial increase in public resources being sought by the TAC, my officials requested further information to support the resource request to ensure that the proposed balance of administrative staff and the existing Commissioners would be effective in addressing that workload. The TAC informed my Department in early March of this year that they had commenced commissioning a review of their resources and operations. I am awaiting receipt of this report and, in the meantime, I have also commissioned an independent reviewer with significant experience of civil service bodies and operations to assess the current position and advise how best to address the TAC's resource needs going forward.  This review has been expedited in order that resourcing decisions, based on a sound business case for the resolution of the current backlog, can be made as soon as possible.<\/p><p>I am conscious that an effective, transparent and fair tax appeals system for taxpayers is an essential aspect of any tax system.  As Minister, I must ensure that the TAC is provided with the right resources so that it may best address the issues it faces and provide an effective, transparent and robust service for taxpayers. I expect to receive the reports from both reviews soon, and the recommendations from these reports will inform my decision making in relation to the Commission's resource needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD03300"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[30687\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the rise in the number of motor vehicles being scrapped each year in view of the fact owners are either failing to get motor insurance quotes or are receiving prohibitively expensive quotes; the steps he will take with the motor insurance industry to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>While the issue of \"End of Life\" Vehicles does not fall under the remit of my Department,  I am aware that there is a motor industry group which is highlighting what they consider to be a link between the number of cars being scrapped annually and the lack of availability or the higher price of motor insurance for such cars.  In this respect, Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD met last week with the group to listen to their concerns.  He has asked the group to submit more information on aspects of their conclusions as they relate to insurance.  I also understand that the Minister of State intends to write to Insurance Ireland on foot of this in order to try and get a more detailed perspective on the matter of insurance for older cars. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate however that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age of the vehicle, as well as the type of vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant driving experience, the claims record, the number of drivers, and how the vehicle is used.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to the age of a vehicle and the availability of cover, different insurance companies will use different age thresholds.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, my officials are engaging with Insurance Ireland in relation to the availability and cost of insurance for older cars, and have been informed that certain insurance providers have recently changed their acceptance criteria and increased their vehicle age threshold levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD03600"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[30969\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the cap on intangible assets that could be written off against profits was raised to 100% in budget 2015.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>Capital allowances for intangible assets were introduced in Finance Act 2009 to support the development of the knowledge economy and the provision of high quality employment.  When the capital allowances were introduced, to ensure that a measure of tax remained in charge annually, a restriction was provided to cap the amount of income that the allowances could be used against in any year at 80%.  The restriction did not deny the use of the capital allowances, it merely lengthened the time period over which they could be utilised.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is not unique in providing capital allowances for intangible assets and the tax treatment of intangible assets is similar to the approach taken in other countries, such as the UK and the US. <\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2014, the cap of 80% was increased to 100%, effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.  The rationale for increasing the cap was to bring the tax treatment of intangible assets into line with the tax treatment of similar assets in other jurisdictions and to enhance the competitiveness of the Irish regime for intangible assets to make Ireland an attractive location for companies to develop intellectual property. This was in recognition of the fact that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by investment in intangible assets. <\/p>  <p>  Noting a significant increase in the use of the capital allowances in 2015, the Coffey Review recommended that, to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenue over time, the 80% cap should be restored, and this recommendation was acted on in Finance Bill 2017.  Again the cap does not affect the overall capital allowances available but merely lengthens the time frame over which they can be used.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":146,"content":"<p>Question No. 105 answered with Question No. 73.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":147,"content":"<p>Question No. 106 answered with Question No. 78.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[30683\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures that have been taken to meet and engage with insurance companies here regarding excessive premiums being charged to consumers particularly in counties Cavan and Monaghan.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>The Deputy should note that in my role as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.

The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator, a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe, has improved by approximately 19 per cent between its peak in 2008 and February 2018. <\/p>  <p>The restoration of Irish competitiveness since 2008 has been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to facilitate growth. In this regard, the most recent National Competitiveness Council bulletin, which highlights our decline in the 2018 IMD Competitiveness rankings, though remaining the 3rd   most competitive economy in the euro area, serves as a reminder that we cannot afford to be complacent. This is all the more important given the significant economic risks we face both internationally and domestically. <\/p>  <p>  On the external side, the impact of Brexit has already been felt through the strengthening of the euro against sterling. Other international risks include the policy stance in the US, including in relation to taxation. In terms of domestic risks to competitiveness, overheating and housing supply pressures are of particular concern. The housing sector can adversely impact on competitiveness through, for example, restricting the mobility of labour.<\/p>  <p>  These risks highlight the importance of maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies, including sustainable fiscal policies, to help address emerging uncertainties and avoid pro-cyclical policy contributing to overheating pressures. With regard to housing, a number of initiatives were introduced in Budget 2018, in addition to the measures implemented in &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo;,  to tackle the underlying problem of  a supply shortage.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Brexit, as part of the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy, Ireland Connected, a number of measures have been set out to specifically address Brexit related issues, including diversification of markets for indigenous exporters. Greater market diversification must be part of the policy response, so that dependence and exposure to the UK market is reduced. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, competitiveness has improved but we must not be complacent. My Department will continue to monitor all relevant developments closely as we seek to ensure that the economy is best placed to weather economic shocks to the greatest extent possible. Competitiveness is an important factor in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":154,"content":"<p>Question No. 109 answered with Question No. 89.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Operations","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[30682\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to address the diminution of banking services in rural areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>I should stress at the outset that the Government has no formal role in the commercial decisions of the banks as to their future business model and whether or not they will close particular branches.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will no doubt appreciate that the provision of services by banks, including the location of branches, is a commercial decision for the Boards and management of the institutions.<\/p>  <p>  That said, I expect that any bank closing branches will do everything that it can to mitigate the impacts of the branch closures on local communities, including technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery.

It utilises an on-lending model, making finance available through both bank and non-bank partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. It is also developing a further of risk-sharing-counter guarantee schemes, such as the Agricultural Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The SBCI began lending in March 2015. To the end of December 2017, SBCI supported funding of &euro;920m has been provided to 22,962 SMEs supporting 119,392 jobs. Of specific relevance to this question is that approximately 85% of SBCI supported lending has gone to SMEs based outside Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD05100"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[28985\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100079#WRD05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he will introduce legislation on the rainy day fund; and when he will report on the work done to date by his Department in framing the structure and rules of this expenditure.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>I intend to introduce rainy day fund legislation very shortly.

This is a commercial matter for each individual credit institution having regard to the relevant legal and regulatory requirements which apply.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may, however, be interested to note that the Central Bank of Ireland, as part of its independent mandate to preserve and protect financial stability in Ireland, introduced macro-prudential measures for residential mortgage lending in February 2015. These macro-prudential measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. Currently these measures generally provide, subject to a certain level of discretion available to lenders, that the size of a primary dwelling residential mortgage loan shall not exceed 3.5 times the gross annual income of the borrower(s) or, in the case of a second and subsequent buyer(s), 80 per cent of the value of the residential property which will act as security for the mortgage loan.<\/p>  <p>  However, the particular loan-to-value restrictions on mortgage borrowers as set out in the regulations do not apply to borrowers in negative equity who wish to purchase a new home.

Zucman, T. T&oslash;rsl&oslash;v and L. Wier, that examines attribution of profits by mutlinationals around the world.   <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, I reject any assertion that Ireland is a tax haven.  The report does not provide any definition of a tax haven and appears to assert that Ireland, and many other countries, are tax havens without providing a rationale for that assertion. <\/p>  <p>  In the report, the authors appear to use the terms \"low-tax countries\" and \"tax havens\" interchangeably. The inference that Ireland is a tax haven simply because of our longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate is totally out of line with the long established position that a low corporate tax rate applied to a wide tax base is good economic policy for attracting investment and supporting economic growth.<\/p>  <p>  The central analysis of the paper looks at links between the level of profit booked, and the level of wages paid in a country.  This creates a totally misleading impression that corporate profits are or should be directly linked to wage levels rather than to the outputs of investment in all income generating activities such as investment in R&amp;D, intangible assets, capital intensive machinery and investment in staff etc. A small country with high levels of high value adding FDI relative to the size of the domestic economy will of course appear like an outlier in this type of analysis. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to be very clear &ndash; corporation tax is paid where value is created not simply where companies have their highest wage bills.  It is therefore misleading to assert that profits are being artificially shifted by focusing on the ratio of profits to wages in each country. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of reputation, Ireland has a competitive corporation tax rate, an attractive and stable tax regime and a strong reputation and commitment to transparency. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tax regime is designed to encourage the location of real, substantive and high-value adding investment in the country.  We do not apologise for having a competitive tax regime because we ensure that our overall regime is fully in line with international standards for fair tax competition as agreed at the EU and the OECD.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the only way to ensure that the right tax is paid in the right place is to ensure that all tax authorities have access to all relevant information for assessing whether they are owed any tax.  This is why tax transparency and exchange of information among tax authorities is so vital. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has continuously made changes to our tax legislation to ensure we meet all international best practices for exchange of tax information.  Last August, the Global Forum on Tax Transparency and Exchange of Information (an OECD led peer-review) awarded Ireland the highest international rating on tax transparency and exchange of information, one of only twenty two jurisdictions globally to be so rated following a new and enhanced peer review process.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland actively contributes towards preventing aggressive tax planning through the implementation of the OECD BEPS reports and the numerous EU Directives we have agreed on tax avoidance.  We continue to play our part in this ongoing work.

The share of net corporation tax receipts provided by the &ldquo;Top 10&rdquo; tax paying companies in 2017 was 39 per cent, up slightly from the 37 per cent paid in 2016 but still below the 41 per cent in 2015, which is suggestive of widening profitability in other companies.  The report also provides information on receipts in each of the years 2013 to 2017 from the top ten payers in each given year, illustrating the change in composition of the top 10 payers over time. Overall, while there are variations from year to year, this level of concentration is relatively stable over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the evidence from this report indicates that Corporation Tax receipts have not become significantly more concentrated as a percentage of overall tax receipts in recent years. In 2013, the Top 10 taxpayers accounted for 36% of Corporation Tax receipts, while in 2017 the Top 10 taxpayers accounted for 39% of Corporation Tax Receipts. <\/p>  <p>  The report also notes that the number of net payers of corporation tax increased by nearly 6,300 (14%), with over 50,000 companies paying net corporation tax in 2017, and shows trading profits increasing in the majority of sectors.  Both these factors point to a general, broad-based improvement in profitability in the corporate sector.<\/p>  <p>  As a country which has been consistently successful in attracting leading multi-nationals to locate here, and given Ireland&rsquo;s level of integration with the global economy, it is not surprising that our corporation tax base is quite concentrated. Nonetheless, I am not complacent to the risks associated with the concentration of corporation tax receipts and will continue to monitor the situation closely. <\/p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that the Government has committed to the establishment of a Rainy Day Fund to enhance the resilience of the public finances.

Modified domestic demand, which adjusts for distortions in the data, is up 4.0 per cent in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The strength of domestic demand is evident in the labour market. Employment growth remains strong with an annual rate of 2.9 per cent recorded in 2017, representing over 61,000 additional jobs. The momentum in the labour market has continued into 2018 with data for the first quarter again showing employment growth of 2.9 per cent. As a result, employment levels now exceed the pre-crisis peak.<\/p>  <p>  Other recent data confirm that momentum in the economy has continued into 2018:<\/p>  <p>  - Core retail sales, i.e., excluding car sales, are up 4.5 per cent in the first 5 months of the year compared to the same period in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  - Export growth has been very strong with the volume of exports increasing by 18.7 per cent on an annual basis in the first four months of the year.<\/p>  <p>  - The monthly unemployment rate for June was 5.1 per cent, down from its peak of 16 per cent in early-2012.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the 2018 Stability Programme Update, my Department forecast real GDP growth of 5.6 per cent this year and 4 per cent next year. Over the medium-term, GDP is projected to grow by around 3 per cent per annum with positive contributions from both domestic demand and net exports.<\/p>  <p>  These projections assumed that a transition period will be agreed that extends or replicates existing frameworks until end-2020 i.e. the UK is assumed to remain in the single market and customs union during this period. From 2021 onwards, the baseline forecasts assume that the EU and UK conclude a free trade agreement; there is, of course, considerable uncertainty in relation to the post-exit nature of trading arrangement between the EU and the UK.<\/p>  <p>  While the economic situation is relatively healthy at present, there are a number of significant risks facing the Irish economy. First and foremost is the potential fallout from a more adverse-than-excepted outcome of the Brexit discussions currently under way. Secondly, given the importance of the traded sector in the Irish economy, any disruption to world trade and in particular a tit-for-tat trade war would have a disproportionate impact on Irish growth prospects. In addition, a faster-than-expected normalisation of monetary policy, rising geopolitical uncertainty and changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime all have the potential to derail the recovery.<\/p>  <p>  While US tax reform has the potential to adversely impact Ireland, our access to the European market is, and will remain, a key factor in attracting FDI from the US and elsewhere.  Global business, from the US or elsewhere, will always want to have operations in the EU, and Ireland will remain attractive as an EU location to invest in and do business from.<\/p>  <p>  There are also domestic challenges such as housing supply and overheating pressures and the related challenge of maintaining competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in recent years in improving Ireland's competitiveness. The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator, a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe, has improved by approximately 19 per cent between its peak in 2008 and February 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The restoration of Irish competitiveness since 2008 has been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to facilitate growth. In this regard, the most recent National Competitiveness Council bulletin, which highlights our decline in the 2018 IMD Competitiveness rankings, though remaining the 3rd most competitive economy in the euro area, serves as a reminder that we cannot afford to be complacent. This is all the more important given the significant economic risks we face including Brexit which has already negatively impacted on our competitiveness through sterling depreciation.<\/p>  <p>  As the depreciation in sterling most likely reflects a structural change in the UK economy, it is essential that the policy response is also structural in nature and in line with EU State Aid rules. Continued market diversification must be part of the policy response, so that dependence on and exposure to the UK market is reduced. As part of the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy, Ireland Connected, a number of measures have been set out to specifically address Brexit related issues, including diversification of markets for indigenous exporters. Greater market diversification must be part of the policy response, so that dependence and exposure to the UK market is reduced.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, I am satisfied that the economy is in good shape at the moment.  However, there are a number of risks. The best way to mitigate such risks is to improve the resilience of the economy. The Government will play its part by continuing to implement competitiveness-oriented policies &ndash; including those that address emerging bottlenecks &ndash; and ensuring that the public finances continue to be managed in a prudent fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100082#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"House Prices","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100082#WRG05000"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[31116\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100082#WRG05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which he monitors house property prices with a view to prevention of inflation through that sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":282,"content":"<p>My Department continues to monitor developments in the property market, including trends in property prices, on an ongoing basis.

Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.<\/p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.  This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges.  It is available on my Department's website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie<\/i>.  Among the key findings of the review was that, while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers.<\/p><p>The website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also lists the various charges imposed by the various financial institutions in Ireland for different types of transactions<i>www.ccpc.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking. Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would again strongly encourage people to look at this comparison site with their specific circumstances in mind in order to decide which institution offers the best product for their pattern of account usage.  My Department has run two media campaigns as part of a range of competition measures agreed with the European Commission to raise awareness and promote customer switching in the retail financial product area.  This was agreed in the context of the restructuring plans for AIB and PTSB.  The campaign is being funded entirely by the two banks.  The campaign website <i>www.switchyourbank.ie<\/i>provides straightforward practical information and support on switching and I would strongly encourage people to visit it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100083#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100083#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[31118\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100083#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which working capital continues to be made available to the farming and business sectors with particular reference to smaller enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>Supporting the availability of finance for SMEs, including smaller enterprises, is a cornerstone element of Government policy in our efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs.  Government is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  To facilitate this the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future funding needs of SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  To continue to monitor levels of working capital available to SMEs, my Department conducts biannual surveys looking at demand for credit by SMEs.  The most recent Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2017, shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 88% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved. 38% of responders cited working capital\/cash flow requirements as the main reason they were applying for bank finance.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds\/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 81% of working capital coming from this source (up 8%) since September 2016.  The survey for the period to end-March 2018 is underway at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is targeted specifically towards smaller enterprises, it provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) also ensures that viable SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources.  The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and four non-bank on-lending partners. The SBCI has a current funding capacity of over &euro;1 billion which it makes available to its on-lending partners as demand from SMEs arises.  To the end of December 2017, SBCI cumulative lending stood at &euro;920 million supporting 22,962 SMEs.  In 2017, &euro;391 million of loans were drawn by Irish SMEs with an average loan size of &euro;37,300.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2018, the SBCI launched a &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, the Scheme is open to all SMEs and Midcaps with less than 499 employees that are viable but vulnerable and exposed to the impact of Brexit.  The Scheme will provide loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million at a maximum interest rate of 4% with a term of 1-3 years to eligible enterprises.  The Scheme will be in operation from March 2018 until March 2020, or until the Scheme has been fully subscribed.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector which it sees as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  My Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish businesses have sufficient access to finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100083#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":290,"content":"<p>Question No. 157 answered with Question No. 153.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100083#WRH00900"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[31120\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100083#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which an assessment has been carried out to clarify whether inflationary tendencies and speculative practice in the building sector during the economic boom continues to impact on the provision of a comprehensive housing programme in the current climate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>My Department continues to monitor developments in the property market, including trends in property prices, on an ongoing basis.

Their actions against this form of criminal activity include a range of measures to identify and target those involved in the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the illicit products and, wherever possible, prosecuting the persons involved.  <\/p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and the risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packets is used to intercept illicit products when they enter the State.  Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work together on an ongoing basis in acting against tobacco crime, and both organisations cooperate closely with their Northern Ireland counterparts, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this form of criminality.  In addition, Revenue works closely with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office, Europol and other international organisations, including the World Customs Organisation, in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat tobacco crime.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s extensive programme of work against the illegal tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success.  In the period from 2013 to 2017 some 240 million cigarettes and 20,000 kilograms of tobacco were seized.  In March of this year, a joint operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na led to the closing down of a major illegal cigarette factory at Jenkinstown, Co. Louth.  Over 23 million illicit cigarettes and 71 tonnes of tobacco were seized at this facility.  <\/p>  <p>  Estimating the extent of any illegal activity is inherently problematic, but the annual surveys carried out by Ipsos MRBI for Revenue and the Health Services Executive provide an indication of the trend in the incidence of illegal tobacco products.  The 2017 survey found that 13% of the cigarette packs encountered during the project were illicit.  While this is higher than in 2016 (10%), it is nevertheless lower than the levels of 15-16% recorded in the earlier years of the survey, in the period from 2009-2011.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue seeks to prosecute in any case where a person can be connected with the trade in illegal tobacco products or can be shown to be otherwise involved in criminal behaviour related to that trade.  In 2017, there were 26 summary convictions connected with the smuggling of illegal tobacco products, as well as 53 relating to offences such as holding or selling them.  In addition, 9 persons were convicted on indictment in respect of such offences.  I understand also that there has been a conviction arising from the discovery of the illegal cigarette factory in Co. Louth in March, where the person concerned was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, and that further cases related to this detection are before the Courts.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised also that Revenue keeps its programmes of action against fiscal fraud under ongoing review, to ensure that available resources are utilised to best effect in tackling these threats to legitimate businesses and the Exchequer, and that they act to augment these resources where necessary. In 2017 a new mobile x-ray scanner was purchased and deployed at Dublin Port to support the work of detecting and seizing illegal products.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against the illegal tobacco trade continues to achieve considerable success.  Revenue is, however, aware of the need for constant vigilance and to be ready to respond to any new developments or threats in this area, and action against this criminality will remain a priority for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100084#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100084#WRJ00700"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[31421\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100084#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an assessment of the number of additional customs officers that would be required in the event of a hard Brexit or no-deal Brexit has been conducted; if so, the outcome of the assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[31422\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100084#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who have applied to be an authorised economic operator in 2016 and 2017 and to date in 2018; the number that have been granted this status; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[31423\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100084#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an assessment has been done of the cost of updating all the necessary technology at ports and airports and points of entry to the State as a consequence of Brexit and changes to customs procedures; if so, the outcome of the assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":335,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 to 175, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being progressed through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This includes &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; contingency planning.  Such planning provides base line scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors.  This approach is also enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a Withdrawal Agreement is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  <\/p><p>My Department, along with the Revenue Commissioners, is actively engaged in this preparatory work which has intensified in recent months and is currently well advanced.  <\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s contingency planning includes examining the full range of scenarios that may apply including a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit.  This work includes an assessment of the potential number of additional staff that will be required as a result of Brexit.  However, given the uncertainty that exists as to the ongoing Article 50 negotiations and the future customs arrangements that may apply, it is too early to be definitive on the potential resources that may be required.  <\/p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that their preparations include a review of existing customs technology required for processing the entry and exit of goods to and from the State.  This consists of a suite of IT systems through which traders submit customs declarations and supporting documents.  <\/p><p>Brexit has the potential to result in a significant increase in customs transactions which necessitates performance testing and tuning of those IT systems.  At present, approximately 1.4 million customs declarations are processed each year, representing import and export trade with non-EU countries.  In addition, some 57,000 transits are processed.  While there may be an increase in processing requirements after Brexit, estimation of the increase in demand is difficult and unreliable because of the possibility of accompanying changes of behaviour in terms of logistics and supply chain arrangements, and uncertainty about the exact arrangements that will be negotiated between UK and EU.  <\/p><p>In addition to performance testing for Brexit, I am advised by Revenue that work is ongoing to deliver on the ambitious IT programme related to the implementation of the Union Customs Code, introduced in 2016.

The CFRAM programme culminated with the launch on 3 May 2018 of 29 Flood Risk Management Plans, which proposed 118 new outline flood relief projects, on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW).  <\/p>  <p>  In that regard funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country was also announced which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including  five large schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by local authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  Aside from the 5 largest schemes and the 31 small or minor projects, the remaining projects in the initial phase of implementation were selected on the basis of those projects which would provide the greatest benefit in terms of the greatest number of properties protected on a regionally balanced basis.  <\/p>  <p>  Included in the first tranche are three major flood relief schemes in County Louth:<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Drogheda, Co. Louth with an estimated cost of &euro;16.83 million will involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) along the River Boyne and improvement of conveyance, hard defences and a flow diversion channel on various tributaries, protecting 381 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Carlingford and Greenore, Co. Louth with an estimated cost of &euro;23.41 million will involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) and two pumping stations, protecting 409 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Dundalk \/ Blackrock South, Co. Louth with an estimated cost of &euro;40.54 million will involve a series of hard defences, including flood embankments and walls, rock armour coastal protection, demountable barriers, road raising, a sluice gate and tanking of two properties, protecting 1,880 properties when completed.  <\/p>  <p>  The OPW has written to all relevant local authorities in order to establish arrangements and structures on how best to progress the first tranche of projects and to maximise the scope for their early delivery, including, where feasible and appropriate, the local authorities taking the lead on the delivery of some of these projects.  A key first step in the process will be the procurement and appointment of engineering design and environmental consultants to begin work on the development of the detailed design of the proposed schemes.  This will commence as soon as possible.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate when construction works will commence.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above three major schemes there are two other projects included in the 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million to be advanced in the initial phase.  <\/p>  <p>  The proposed flood relief scheme at Mornington, Co. Meath with an estimated cost of &euro;530,000 will be progressed directly by Meath County Council with full funding from the OPW.  The work will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 51 properties when completed.  <\/p>  <p>  The proposed flood relief scheme at Ardee, Co. Louth with an estimated cost of &euro;840,000 will also be progressed directly by Louth County Council with full funding from the OPW.  The work will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 7 properties when completed.  <\/p>  <p>  There is one proposed scheme not included in the first phase of implementation.  The proposed flood relief scheme at Baltray, Co. Louth has been identified by the CFRAM programme to be progressed at a projected cost of &euro;1.93 million.  This proposed scheme involves the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 73 properties when completed.  The OPW and the local authority will work closely to ensure that it will be commenced in the coming years and within the 10-year timeframe for the programme of investment.  <\/p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress the scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies as well as the general public takes place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100084#WRJ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100085#WRK00300"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[31170\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100085#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans for future recruitment of staff who are proficient in Irish; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is an independent statutory recruitment body for the civil service.

As it is not possible to progress all 118 proposed new schemes at once, funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country was also announced which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including the five largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by local authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  Aside from the 5 largest schemes and the 31 small projects, the remaining projects in the initial phase of implementation were selected on the basis of those projects which would provide the greatest benefit in terms of the greatest number of properties protected on a regionally balanced basis.

In particular disclosures of what could potentially comprise relevant information under the Protected Disclosures Act made to my Department or the HEA have been dealt with in accordance with the legislative framework provided by the Act and procedures consistent with the guidance for public bodies issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under section 21 of the Act.  The Protected Disclosures Act itself has retrospective effect to the extent that redress can be sought by a worker in respect of penalisation for making a protected disclosure made before the legislation was commenced where the penalisation was subsequent to or ongoing from that date.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Act, the HEA wrote to all institutions under its aegis in May 2014 advising that the higher education sector should not wait until the legislation is enacted but should put in place a process where a person may give information on a confidential basis to a specified person who can act as an intermediary in the investigation of any allegations into misconduct or mis-governance in a higher education institution.  As far as the policy in place in the higher education sector prior to the Protected Disclosures Act for dealing with disclosures of potential wrongdoing is concerned, the codes of governance in place since 2012 in the higher education sector contained a provision that governing bodies should put in place procedures for confidential disclosure or good faith reporting whereby employees may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible irregularities in financial reporting or other matters and for ensuring meaningful follow-up of matters raised in this way. This approach was in turn based on the provisions of the 2009 code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The oversight and implementation of any disclosures received by the HEA prior to Protected Disclosures Act coming into effect, would have depended on the specific circumstances of each individual case.  I understand that concerns raised with the HEA would have been assessed to seek to determine the most appropriate course of action based on the information received.  This could have potentially involved, for example, further contact with the individual raising the concern to obtain more information or the making of a request to the relevant higher education institution for a response to the issues raised in order for the HEA to consider the matter and next steps further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100086#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Data","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100086#WRL03300"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[31171\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100086#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the secondary schools that provide classes and supports for secondary school children on the autism spectrum in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>It is the policy of this Department that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with Autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. <\/p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. <\/p><p>The NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016) found that Students are generally well supported in schools with appropriate curriculum; extensive teacher and SNA supports; improving range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment; improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post primary levels.<\/p><p>The NCSE policy advice noted that ASD is a spectrum condition, so some students with ASD require little support in school and are relatively independent in their learning, while others require significant levels of support. <\/p><p>The NCSE Policy Advice also states that International Research findings suggest that most students with ASD should be considered for inclusion in mainstream education with their peers, where inclusion is well-planned and well-resourced.<\/p><p>Decisions about placement should be based on individual needs and take into account a number of factors including parental wishes, availability of evidence-based treatments and well-trained staff and individual factors such as targets for intervention and management of behaviours.<\/p><p>There is therefore not one preferred educational environment for children with ASD, rather there is a model which takes into account the assessed educational needs of individual pupils.<\/p><p>As such, this Department&rsquo;s policy focuses on ensuring that all students, including those with autism spectrum disorders, can have access to an education appropriate to meeting their needs and abilities.<\/p><p>The range of supports and services which are made available include additional special educational support teaching, Special Needs Assistants support, funding for the purchase of specialised equipment, services of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), enhanced levels of capitation in Special schools and Special Classes and additional teacher training.<\/p><p>Other resources which are provided to schools to support children with Autism include the following:<\/p><p>- Assistive technology.<\/p><p>- Professional development for teachers.<\/p><p>- Access to the Special School transport scheme.<\/p><p>- Access to special equipment and furniture where required.<\/p><p>- Enhanced capitation grant.<\/p><p>- Adapted school buildings.<\/p><p>- Access to the extended school year scheme.

This is due to the impact of the Carillion liquidation on the timing of completion of Schools Bundle 5.

A number of building contractors experienced serious difficulties in 2018 resulting in either liquidation or examinership; this had an impact on a number of large scale projects where building works were either halted or significantly delayed.  The unfavourable weather in February and March also had an impact on the pace of delivery of building projects, and a number of large scale projects expected to commence on site in the early months of 2018 experienced delays.

As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Reserve on the 31 May 2018 was 558.  It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways: firstly,\u00a0276 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointments Service (PAS)\u00a0have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. <\/p><p>With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track, it was possible for the Commissioner and the\u00a0Public Appointments Service\u00a0to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves\u00a0last March.  That competition\u00a0attracted 2,394 applicants of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS.  These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office.  The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors, including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons.  It is expected that the first of the successful candidates will commence training in the Garda College in the coming months.<\/p><p>In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing. To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority, as set out in the Policing Plan 2018. <\/p><p>As a first step, the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement.  This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens.  This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground and\u00a0engaging with local communities.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have attached in tabular form the number of Reserves in each Division as of 31 May 2016 and 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>Garda Reserve Strength 31 May 2016 and 31 May 2018<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>DIVISION<\/th><th>31 May 2016<\/th><th>31 May 2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

I am informed that this approach adopts good practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and in utilising available criminal law to its fullest extent in tackling all forms of organised crime, including drug trafficking.<\/p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. <\/p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.\u00a0 I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the increasingly important place of human rights and equality in the Irish public service.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Training for civil servants is also provided by the Commission in e-learning format.\u00a0 An online\u00a0programme titled &ldquo;Delivering Equality in Public Services: An Introduction for Front Line Staff&rdquo; provides public sector staff with the essentials they need to know about Irish equality law in their work.  In addition to the core parts of the equality legislation, the course provides explanations of diversity, stereotyping and positive action as well as why these matter for front-line public sector staff.<\/p>  <p>  A particular innovation in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act is the creation in Section 42 of a positive legal duty on public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality, and protect human rights, in their daily work.  This requires public bodies to take pro-active steps to address the equality and human rights issues that affect the people who use their services, people affected by their policies and people employed in the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission is playing an important role in assisting and supporting public bodies to comply with this new Duty, including by the development of practical guidance and resources for public bodies and a campaign of awareness raising across a wide range of public bodies and civil society organisations.  The Commission has also recently undertaken pilot projects with five separate organisations (Cork City Council; Monaghan County Council; University College Cork; Irish Probation Service; Community Action Network) with the aim of supporting the development of approaches to implementing the Duty in differing contexts.  The Commission also allocated grant funding in 2016 and 2017 to organisations to promote human rights and equality.  In 2017, awards were made under two overarching themes, one of which was to support the implementation of the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty.<\/p>  <p>  In the wider public sector, organisations are developing their approaches to implementing the Duty under the guidance of the Commission.  Several large public sector organisations, including the Department of Justice and Equality and Revenue, have established cross-divisional working groups tasked with working collaboratively to integrate the duty into existing policies and structures.<\/p>  <p>  In an effort to promote and maintain best practice in the areas of equality, human rights and non-discrimination, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with a range of training programmes in these areas.  This aims to ensure that no element of stereotyping or prejudice consciously or unconsciously informs day-to-day policing decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The new trainee Student Education\/Training Programme for Garda recruits, which involves a total of 104 weeks training, now results in an award of a Bachelor of Arts (Level 7) in Applied Policing.  Human rights modules have been threaded through this Programme and this is a core competency on which students are assessed.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a comprehensive education, training and information system for the continuous professional development of all members.  This development programme incorporates the following human rights training:<\/p>  <p>  - There is a two and a half day human rights and anti-racism module on the Sergeant and Inspector Development courses; <\/p>  <p>  - A human rights module on the course for Senior Investigating Officers is provided by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.

On receipt of any complaint, the matter is the subject of a full investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, on completion of such investigation, an Investigation File is submitted to the DPP who, on being satisfied that there is sufficient evidence available to warrant a prosecution, will direct what charges, if any, are to be brought forward.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, the independent Garda Inspectorate published a wide-ranging Report on Crime Investigation.  This included a number of recommendations to help improve the way racist crime is recorded and to support victims of such crimes.  The Inspectorate recommended, inter-alia, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na implemented a victim-centered policy and good investigative practices in racial, homophobic and other similar crimes to encourage victims to report offences. <\/p>  <p>  To achieve the above recommendation, the following key actions were to be taken:<\/p>  <p>  - Ensure that all crimes containing elements of hate or discrimination are flagged on PULSE;<\/p>  <p>  - Create clear modus operandi features on PULSE that allow the accurate recording of the nine strands of the Diversity Strategy;<\/p>  <p>  - Develop third party reporting sites to accommodate victim reporting; and<\/p>  <p>  - Review the decision to merge the role of ELO\/LGBT officers.<\/p>  <p>  Several steps have been taken to address these recommendations: <\/p>  <p>  Improvements were made to the PULSE system in 2015 which will help in addressing the recommendations.  PULSE 6.8 was released in November 2015 and, among the enhancements included in this release, was the introduction of a Victim Assessment Screen.  This requires the mandatory recording of data relating to the apparent motive for a crime incident, such as whether it has been motivated by discrimination on specific grounds including age, disability, race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. In addition, the Policing Plan 2018 provides commitments that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will produce a definition of, and procedures to record, hate crime.<\/p>  <p>  Improvements to the PULSE system also enable the recording of all interactions with victims and facilitate the communication of information to victims on all aspects of the investigative process.  These improvements will facilitate the issuing of correspondence to victims in accordance with the E.U. Directive on Victims of Crime.<\/p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that important steps already taken include the establishment on 16 March 2015 of Garda Victim Service Offices in each Garda Division.  These Offices aim to enhance the Garda service being provided to victims of crime and traumatic events by placing victims at the centre of the Garda service and providing a respectful, reassuring, responsive and reliable service addressing the needs and expectations of all victims who require an individual response.<\/p>  <p>  Other developments following on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s Report include the establishment of a Data Quality Team within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the development of a new Incident Recording Process to enhance overall data quality.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis.  These officers, together with the Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office, play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities and to help prevent hate and racist crime.  The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office and Ethnic Liaison Officers provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100089#WRO03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100089#WRO03100"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[31198\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100089#WRO03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce an independent inspection regime for direct provision; and if so, the stage this process is at.","asker":"1215","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>My Department, through the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), is responsible for the provision of accommodation and related services to protection applicants while they await a decision on their claim for international protection.

I understand from my discussions with the Chairperson,\u00a0Kathleen O'Toole,\u00a0that\u00a0the Commission expects to publish its report in accordance with that\u00a0timeline.  The members of the Commission come from diverse backgrounds and have impressive track records in their respective fields.  The Chairperson was, of course, a member of the Patten Commission which developed the blueprint for the successful transformation of the PSNI following the Good Friday Agreement.

We - all 28 EU Member States and the EU Commission - are clear that these tariffs are not justifiable on national security grounds.  We fully subscribe to the EU position that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission, which leads on Trade Policy for the Member States under the Treaties, and working in full consultation with the Member States, has\u00a0prepared a measured, proportionate, and WTO-compatible response, which Ireland has\u00a0fully\u00a0supported. These measures include the launching of proceedings by the EU against the US at the WTO, the introduction of rebalancing tariff measures by the EU\u00a0and the possible\u00a0imposition of provisional safeguard measures comprising import quotas or tariffs to shield EU producers from a sudden influx of steel or aluminium into the EU market which would ordinarily have been destined for the US market.<\/p>  <p>  EU leaders have also endorsed a positive agenda for dialogue on trade issues with the US, once the steel and aluminium tariffs against the EU are lifted. Ireland is of the view that the EU should not negotiate under threat, and that any talks must be preceded by a permanent exemption. The EU and its Member States are also working with other like-minded countries &ndash; such as Japan, Canada, and Mexico &ndash; to develop an agreed approach to issues of concern.  We continue, of course, to keep open the lines of communication with the US Administration and other key &lsquo;influencers&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The US has sought to use the threat of tariffs as leverage to obtain trade concessions from the EU.  The EU&rsquo;s united approach that we are willing and able to respond when necessary in the face of such unilateral non-WTO-compliant actions is vital . We believe the US Administration is resolute on these issues at this time and, therefore, we believe the EU must remain as resolute and stay united.  The alternative is to accept such action in breach of WTO rules as the EU understands them. Over the past number of months, the EU has engaged with the US at all possible levels, and with other partners, to find a solution to the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector. Indeed, I met with Secretary Ross in Washington to discuss these and related matters in May.<\/p>  <p>  At a national level, we continue to monitor potential impacts of the trade measures being taken by the US, as well as those being contemplated. We remain alive to the fact that while certain actions may have limited impact at macro level, this could possibly mask individual firm level impacts.

A full report of the review will be presented shortly and will provide recommendations on a framework for the future operation of the employment permits regime.  <\/p>  <p>  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and wider EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national subject to the Employment Permits Acts and Regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed in part through the operation of the highly skilled and ineligible occupation lists for the purpose of grant of employment permits.  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs and, coordinated by the National Skills Council, the annual National Skills Bulletin and the annual Vacancy Overview Report in tandem with a public consultation process.  <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that a review of the lists of occupations for employment permits will be conducted in the second half of this year.   Healthcare assistants are currently included on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL).   In order to remove a skill from this list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and\/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.

Under the Plan, the HSE will deliver 1.14 million hospital procedures.  The NTPF will deliver additionality to the health system with the provision of 22,000 Inpatient Day Case treatments through both outsourcing and HSE insourcing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department will continue to work with the HSE and the NTPF to identify sustainable initiatives to improve waiting times.  Last year funding was allocated to provide additional capacity at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital as a result of such initiatives and a cataract theatre is now operational three days per week.  This year, in line with the Action Plan, the HSE is planning to open a dedicated Cataract theatre in Nenagh Hospital later this month.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is responsible for collecting and validating all waiting lists for public hospitals.  As part of its statutory responsibilities the NTPF has also developed the National Waiting List Management Protocol, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  This Protocol, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists. Furthermore, the NTPF also undertakes an annual audit programme of public hospitals to ensure compliance with the waiting list protocol.<\/p>  <p>  Last month I approved the establishment of a central validation function in the National Treatment Purchase Fund in order to centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE.  The NTPF envisages being in a position to commence validation of patient files from September of this year. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, my Department has placed a particular priority on performance improvement in scheduled and unscheduled care in order to improve access for patients.  At the end of 2017, a new Unit was established in my Department with a remit to work with colleagues, HSE and NTPF to provide strategic direction and drive a whole-of-Department approach to performance oversight and innovation in this area.  The monitoring of waiting lists is a key activity of this Unit. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, work on the development of an integrated waiting list solution, tailored specifically to meet the needs of the Irish health system, is being advanced this year.  The NTPF has examined the feasibility to progressing to an integrated system.  This report is being reviewed by my unit with a view to establishing a high-level governance structure at system level to lead on implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100093#WRS03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100093#WRS04200"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[31195\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100093#WRS04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the most commonly identified causes for delays on long waiting lists for elective patients referred by general practitioners to consultants; the extent to which the most readily identified causes have been discovered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>Improving waiting times for hospital procedures is a key commitment in the Programme for Government.

This is a modern Act and is the main legal instrument available to my Department to enforce animal welfare standards.  The basic rule may be summarised by stating that persons having possession or control of an animal have responsibility for the care and welfare of that animal; it is this person&rsquo;s duty to take all necessary steps to protect the animal from unnecessary suffering and neglect, and not to be reckless regarding the animal&rsquo;s welfare.  There is a specific requirement to ensure that an animal has access to an adequate supply of wholesome food and water.<\/p>  <p>  The Act\u00a0 is enforced by authorised officers of my Department based at regional offices around the country, members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, officers of Customs and Excise and authorised officers of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\u00a0 In addition, the Chief Executive of a local authority may appoint officers of the local authority to be authorised officers within the administrative area of the authority.<\/p>  <p>  The main powers of enforcement under the Act are contained in section 38 which provides for extensive powers of inspection and investigation, including in appropriate circumstances, seizure and detention of animals.  Section 42 provides for a system of legally binding notices, the breach of which constitutes a criminal offence.  <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for a range of penalties that may be imposed.  On summary conviction, an offender may be fined up to &euro;5,000 (a Class A fine) and\/or be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of up to 6 months.  On conviction on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;250,000 and or a term of 5 years imprisonment may be imposed.  The Court may also,\u00a0in particular circumstances\u00a0disqualify a person from owning, keeping,\u00a0 having charge or control (directly or indirectly) of an animal, or being involved with activities relating to animals for a period, including, where appropriate, for the life of the person.  The determination of any particular case is, of course, a matter for the trial court.  There have been 50 prosecutions to date with a further 28 ongoing.  <\/p>  <p>  In summary, the current modern legislative framework provided by the Act is considered fit for purpose.  Similarly enforcement of the existing legislation has been working satisfactorily, and is kept\u00a0under\u00a0review\u00a0with a view to ongoing\u00a0improvements\u00a0as needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100101#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Administration","counter":1103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100101#WRAA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1104,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[31436\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100101#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, sheep fencing grants reclaimed by his Department in cases in which the farmer did not remain in sheep farming; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1105,"content":"<p>It is a requirement of the TAMS grant aid Scheme for sheep fencing that applicants must own and possess a yearly average of 40 adult sheep (weaned lamb or older) at time of application or at the latest by the date the claim is submitted for payment.

Although the existing capacity of the public charging network is considered adequate, development of infrastructure to meet the growing demand is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of the existing network of publicly accessible charge points was rolled out by the ESB through its eCars programme. This network includes over 70 fast chargers, mainly on national routes.<\/p>  <p>  A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport,\u00a0involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network.

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.<\/p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address and eircode.<\/p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.<\/p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017 and available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie.<\/p><p>The following table outlines the number of premises where access to a high speed broadband connection is, or will be, delivered by commercial operators (BLUE\/LIGHT BLUE) and those where access to this vital service will be delivered under the State led intervention (AMBER).<\/p><p><table><tr><th>County Name<\/th><th>AMBER<br \/><br \/>Premises within the NBP State Intervention Area<\/th><th>BLUE<br \/><br \/>Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area<\/th><th>LIGHT BLUE<br \/><br \/>Premises within eir's commercial rural deployment<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>County Cork<\/td><td>73,500 (28%)<\/td><td>177,400 (66%)<\/td><td>16,100 (6%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North West Cork<\/td><td>20,900 (47%)<\/td><td>18,200 (41%)<\/td><td>5,300 (12%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Nationally <\/td><td>540,000 (23%)<\/td><td>1,600,000 (60%)<\/td><td>160,000 (17%)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following .<\/p><p>Data for Q1 2018 recently submitted by eir to my Department indicates that the company passed\u00a0more than 145,000 premises nationwide as part of its\u00a0planned rural deployment.

These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

The plan provides an outline provision of &euro;2.4 billion for the\u00a0entire programme, &euro;2 billion for Bus Connects in Dublin and &euro;0.4 billion for Bus Connects programmes in our regional cities.\u00a0<\/p><p>Budget 2018 provided for over &euro;750 million over the next 4 years to progress the initial stages of BusConnects.  The costs of the various elements of the overall BusConnects\u00a0programme will be\u00a0confirmed as part of the appropriate appraisal and procurement processes required under the Public Spending Code.<\/p><p>The National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0has responsibility for the planning and implementation\u00a0of public transport projects and programmes in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), including the BusConnects programme.\u00a0<\/p><p>The NTA recently published a discussion document focussed on the 16 core bus routes, pathways and cycle tracks\/lanes that are emerging as the likely core bus corridors in and out of Dublin city. A second document &ldquo;Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign Public Consultation Report&rdquo; was published by NTA\u00a0last week. <\/p><p>This report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin is very complex and is designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes taking people into the city centre, but with very few orbital routes.  Recent improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to the bus services to exploit the full potential of these investments.  Finally the city is growing and changing as are the bus journeys people are taking. <\/p><p>The report identifies 4 key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals and grow suburban feeder networks. While there will be concerns with any change, these strategies will deliver the following benefits<b><\/b>for the customer; much simpler city services; much simpler fare structure; provide more frequent all day services through new and frequent strong orbital services interchanging with local services and high frequency radial spines. <\/p><p>Full public consultation on the network redesign proposals, involving Dublin Bus, using local brochures, local face to face events, digital imaging of the network, on-line surveys and consultation with user groups will commence from the 16th July and will continue for 8 weeks.  NTA will launch a full public consultation process\u00a0on the proposed core bus corridors later this year. <\/p><p>In light of the NTA's responsibility in this matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the Authority for a more detailed reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100104#WRDD04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network Expansion","counter":1265,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100105#WREE00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1266,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[31565\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100105#WREE00400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress his Department has made in respect of the funding, planning and development of the electrification of the Maynooth railway line; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1267,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the General Scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 (now the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017), was published in May 2017 and contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting.  They seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The second Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 concluded on 4 October 2017 and Government approval to draft provisions for a number of additional items to be included in the Bill at Committee Stage was obtained from Cabinet.  These provisions are currently being finalised with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  They include, amongst other matters, provisions related to defined benefit pensions and measures related to the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for the Government is to provide additional protections for scheme members&rsquo; pension benefits.  However, it is essential that any new measures recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise. <\/p>  <p>  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which will, amongst other things, enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit. <\/p>  <p>  In order to achieve a balanced approach it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General in respect of the DB provisions. <\/p>  <p>  The provisions relating to defined benefit pensions are quite technical and complex.  Work on finalising the provisions is at an advanced stage and when complete an early date for Committee Stage will be requested from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100106#WRFF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Income Data","counter":1352,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100107#WRGG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1353,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[31140\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100107#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the rate of severe material deprivation for lone parents here; the way in which this compares to the EU average; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1354,"content":"<p>The latest Eurostat European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions data show that the severe material deprivation rate for lone parent households was 23.2% in Ireland in 2016.  The Irish rate compares to the EU average of 15.7% in 2016 (see Table 1).<\/p><p>The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these figures, which relate to 2016.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 6.8% in mid-2017 to 5.1% now.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  Perhaps most importantly in the current context, the proportion of lone parents who are working rose from 45.4% in 2015 to 51.6% in 2017, and appears to be still rising with the continuing improvement in the labour market.<\/p><p>With the improvement in the fiscal situation, the Government was in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards.  This includes a package of measures to support lone parents, encouraging them into the workplace and into education and helping to reduce their childcare costs.  In Budget 2018 all lone parents on the one-parent family payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance benefitted from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment which were introduced in March.  In addition, the income disregards for the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment increased by &euro;20 from March, from &euro;110 to &euro;130 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.

Meeting this target means lifting almost 95,000 children out of poverty by that date.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the BOBF Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments, is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty, building on the lifecycle approach in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) and informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  2015 saw the first reduction in the number of children in consistent poverty since 2008.  There was a 13,000, or approximately 9 per cent, decrease in the number of children in consistent poverty between 2014 and 2015.  This downward trend continued in 2016, with a consistent poverty rate of 11.1 per cent for children.  The full impact of the economic recovery is not yet reflected in these figures.  The monthly unemployment rate in June 2018 announced by the CSO was 5.1%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2017 and 2018 become available.  The Government continues to focus on activation, to help people back into the workforce.  <\/p>  <p>  To give some perspective and a sense of the size of the challenge Ireland faces in trying to achieve the child poverty target: at the height of the economic boom in 2008, when the consistent poverty rate for children was its lowest, there were 68,000 children in consistent poverty.  So, in order to meet the target, Ireland will have to be more than twice as effective as our best ever performance to date.  It is clear that the target to reduce child poverty by more than 95,000 children, or two thirds of the 2011 rate, is ambitious. <\/p>  <p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality and Ireland is among the best performing EU States for reducing poverty through social transfers.  In 2016 social transfers more than halved the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children, from 40.3 per cent to 19.3 per cent.  <\/p>  <p>  However, reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality affordable services in areas such as education, health, housing and childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100107#WRGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Data","counter":1364,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100107#WRGG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1365,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[31144\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100107#WRGG01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the average waiting time for a decision on appeals for social protection payments paid on a weekly basis, in cases in which there is no oral hearing and in cases in which there is an oral hearing, respectively, in 2018, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1366,"content":"<p>The table provides the details which have been requested by the Deputy to the end of June 2018.

Our Customer Charter and Customer Action Plan 2016-2018sets out the commitments and standard of service that customers can expect in their dealings with the Department.  Among them, customers should be served in a fair, courteous and timely manner, be informed of their rights and entitlements, be provided with full and clear information, and have their privacy respected.  <\/p><p>Essentially, my Department aims to provide the best possible service at all times.  <\/p><p>To that end, a dedicated Customer Service Unit receives and processes a wide range of feedback from customers relating to their interactions with my Department, including comments, compliments, and complaints. This helps to ensure that all formal customer comments and complaints are logged correctly and are responded to in a timely fashion.<\/p><p>Where a customer is dissatisfied with the standard of service that they have received, in the first instance, they are advised to convey their concerns to the staff member or section of the Department with which they have been dealing. Where the issue is not resolved to their satisfaction, customers can submit a formal complaint.  They can do so in a number of different ways, such as by letter, by email, or online using a Customer Feedback Form  , which can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at ).<\/p><p>Alternatively, customers can make contact by phone, or they can speak face to face to a member of staff in any of our Intreo centres around the country. All Department staff with computer access can log an official customer comment or complaint on the Department&rsquo;s complaint management system. <\/p><p>Once a complaint is received, my Department seeks to issue an acknowledgement by letter or email within three working days, and a case reference number is also issued to the customer.  The complaint is then forwarded to the Customer Service Officer(s) within the relevant business area(s) to be investigated and responded to within 15 working days, where practicable.  If it is not possible to issue a response within that period of time, an interim response will issue, explaining why the 15 day time frame cannot be met and providing details of an expected response date.  All complaints will be dealt with promptly, fairly and impartially, and the outcome of the investigation will be reflected in the final response to the customer.  <\/p><p>Customers are advised that if they are unhappy with the outcome of the investigation, they can request to have their complaint reviewed by another officer who was not involved in dealing with the original complaint, explaining why they are not satisfied with the initial response.  If a review is to be conducted, a response is to be provided to the customer within 20 working days.

The Local Authority MPI scheme is a group scheme that is designed to provide an appropriate level of insurance cover to those who wish to avail of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.  This cover provides certainty to both the applicant and the local authority regarding all Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans that are issued, and it is prudent financial practice.

The delivery of targeted affordable housing, for purchase and rent, was a priority topic at last week&rsquo;s Summit which I held with local authority Chief Executives.  It is also featuring prominently at the post-Housing Summit meeting with local authority Directors of Service this week.<\/p>  <p>  A three-pronged, targeted approach to affordable housing provision is being pursued.  Firstly, in terms of affordable housing for purchase, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  This Scheme will be delivered by local authorities developing their sites in key locations.  The Scheme will be complementary to other Government Schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, I am also determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future.  There is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  Cost rental is an important component of progressive housing systems around Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working to get our first cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, ready for tenders to issue shortly.  In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency are undertaking detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site, at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development.  The work of that multi-disciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded shortly.  Once we have proven the concept through the pilot projects I plan to roll out cost rental across other suitable sites.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, I am re-directing the &euro;50 million funding for Phase 2 of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to the Serviced Sites Fund, increasing the scale of the fund from the previously announced &euro;25 million to &euro;75 million.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  The call for proposals under the Serviced Site Fund issued two weeks ago.<\/p>  <p>  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority-owned land, and that analysis is progressing well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100110#WRKK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Funding","counter":1497,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100110#WRKK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1498,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[31569\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018071100110#WRKK02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the engagement his Department has had with the European Investment Bank in respect of the funding of additional social and affordable housing here; his plans to secure additional EIB funding for social and affordable housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1499,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to working with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to secure long-term, low-interest funds for major infrastructure works, including housing development.
