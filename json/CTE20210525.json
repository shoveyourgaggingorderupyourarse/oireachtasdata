Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I will ask Members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to this constitutional requirement.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Those in attendance are asked to mute themselves when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback. They should also use the button to virtually raise their hands when they wish to contribute and take it down afterwards.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee will refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The D&aacute;il recently passed a motion to change Standing Orders to use a more gender-neutral term than Chairman.  The D&aacute;il has agreed that the word \"Cathaoirleach\" will be used instead.  On that basis, will Members address the Chair as \"A Chathaoirligh\"?  For the committee's information, the clerk will circulate the relevant changes to Standing Orders following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  The first item of business is the minutes of our meetings of 18 May and 20 May 2021, which have been circulated to members.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s webpage.<\/p> <p>  There are no accounts or financial statements for consideration this week.<\/p> <p>  Moving to correspondence, as agreed, items not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated.

It was also agreed to request a comprehensive report from the Department regarding the overall position on the transfer of properties and payments from religious congregations to the State, including details of the impediments to transfers and payments and why the processes have taken so long.  We also agreed to request that the Department keep the committee informed regarding the status of properties that remain to be transferred.<\/p> <p>  This has dragged on for a long time.

We did get a report on that in relation to this piece of correspondence.  As was said, this goes back to the indemnity agreement.  The nation was appalled by the Ryan report where there were voluntary transfers. People took it at face value that there would be goodwill behind these, given that in 2009 they were offered.<\/p> <p>  As it was a long list, the last Committee of Public Accounts focused on it.  We started to see a considerable amount of progress made on some of the outstanding transfers.  These transfers were offered in the context of reports that absolutely horrified the nation in terms of the abuse of children.  It probably would come as a surprise to people that the transfer is still not completed, both from the 2002 and 2009 offers.  The State picked up a very sizeable burden while the religious institutions involved got off very lightly in terms of the overall cost.<\/p> <p>  It is just unacceptable that we still have some of these outstanding at this stage.  We must ensure the Department of Education continues to get these properties fully transferred and that we can close off on this.  It is obvious that voluntary transfers in this kind of scenario are something from which we should learn a lesson.  It simply should never happen again.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, the people who lose out on this are the people who have been impacted by it.  Obviously, we sought this information in the context of Caranua which was set up to assist some of those affected by what was effectively incarceration.  We need that report from the Department on the impediments on all of those transfers, as well as the findings and the learnings from the difference between where there was an indemnity agreement and where there was not.<\/p> <p>  There has to be some closure on this.  If it had not been for the last Committee of Public Accounts, that list would be longer.

This and a number of similar responses were received following our decision at our meeting of 23 March to write to all Departments to request information on protected disclosures since the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  We considered 11 responses last week and a further six responses are before us today.  The final response has been received and will be circulated for next week's meeting.

Having engaged with some people who have made protected disclosures or who are whistleblowers, I know that not everyone who makes a protected disclosure will be found to be 100% correct or whatever.  We are now at a point where it is unsatisfactory for many people who make protected disclosures, and this committee has met some people in that context.  It is important that we gather the full set of replies.  There is a directive we have to transpose by the end of the year in regard to widening the number of people who can make protected disclosures, so it would be very useful to have that overview and learning.  Not every committee has what the Committee of Public Accounts has, namely, an overview of all Departments, so we are probably well placed to do that.<\/p><p>We can gather the information in the first instance but I believe we have to do something more than that in considering just exactly how effective it is.

It is important in the first instance that we have a standard collating mechanism so it will be easy to identify the number of protected disclosure declarations made and the number upheld.  The statistics I can glean from the correspondence we have received so far would not inspire many people to make a protected disclosure.  The rate at which disclosures and complaints are upheld is incredibly low.  It would be useful for this committee, at some stage in the medium term, to carry out a full analysis of the experience of those who make protected disclosures and how they are dealt with by various Departments and agencies.  The protected disclosures mechanism was considered by the Oireachtas to be an important route by which wrongdoing, maladministration, error or erroneous practices could be identified safely.  We are looking at evidence from across several Departments indicating that protected disclosures are left in an administration process for a long number of years.  At the end of the day, no action is taken on the vast majority of disclosures.  That is not to suggest that there will not always be frivolous or unsubstantiated claims or allegations in these processes but the number of claims that are dismissed, passed on to somebody else or left sitting idle for many years points to a worrying practice.  Therefore, there is work in this regard that this committee could usefully do.

The correspondence we have from the Garda ombudsman's office is dated 30 March, which basically indicates that, due to constraints in terms of resources, there has been no progress, or at least no ability to outline a timeframe.  However, on 9 May, I noted in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>quite an amount of information that at least appeared to be extrapolated from the Garda ombudsman's report.  It even goes so far as to indicate it is unlikely there will be any criminal proceedings.  Clearly, somebody has information with regard to this.  This follows a well-worn pattern with regard to many State agencies in that where allegations of a very serious nature are made, the official response is to delay and procrastinate for so long that, by the time findings are released publicly, it is too late to do something about them or hold those responsible to account.  Sometimes this crosses several agencies.  I propose that we write back to the Garda ombudsman on the basis of the media reports from 9 May asking for a further update and that we ask the Garda again whether it has received correspondence from the ombudsman and OLAF and whether, on that basis, it can inform us about the current status of these investigations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#C00800","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I have not seen the media report the Deputy is referring to but it is most likely based on confidential information from a source.

At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item and agreed that any future engagement would include both the IHRB and Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  We also requested clarity regarding the number of racetracks covered by CCTV.  The response is No. 597B, which states: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe 2018 Budget provided &euro;60,000 for the installation of CCTV.  This was estimated to cover three racecourses at an estimated cost of &euro;20,000 per racecourse.  The 2019 budget provided &euro;80,000 for the installation of CCTV.  This was estimated to cover four racecourses again based on a cost of &euro;20,000 per racecourse.  The figures included are estimates and had the project commenced a full procurement process would have had to have been completed before the projects could have commenced. <\/blockquote><p>What is peculiar about this is, according to the statement, money was provided for seven.  We know from previous engagements when HRI representatives were before the committee that only one racecourse in the three-year period had CCTV provided and there was a plan to provide CCTV in one more.  In total, there are 25 racecourses to be covered.  The overall figure was, as I recall, &euro;18 million with money being reused for other purposes.  The response would seem to be completely unsatisfactory.  The response said that the cost of installing CCTV was estimated at &euro;20,000 per racecourse.  It seems three or four tracks were covered.  It is clear that when we take the combined sum there is money provided for seven.<\/p><p> In further correspondence, reference is made to the procurement process commencing for all racecourses.

I wish to bring that to the attention of committee members.<\/p> <p>  We would be hopeful that this would happen.  We dealt with this matter and the organisation earlier in the year.  We dealt with the lack of progress and the fact that only one has been done.  There was confusion over the earlier response and the way it was written.  There was a question over whether the response covered three or four racetracks or three quarters of all racetracks.  It is three or four.  In fact, it is three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#D00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>From looking at the response of the IHRB, anyone would think the provision of CCTV was progressing or proceeding perfectly as normal.

We have to ask questions at this stage given that we have had representatives before us and we have had engagement.  Why would those responsible not seek to speed up the delivery of CCTV given that it would protect the integrity of the sport?  What is the reason for the delay?  There must be some reason the provision of CCTV is not one of the priorities of the regulatory board.  In itself that leads to questions.  Those responsible seem to have been dragging their heels a little from the get-go, even to the extent that they transferred money that had been allocated for CCTV for another online portal, which raises serious questions.<\/p> <p>  The correspondence addresses my reference to the online integrity portal.  The board seems to take issue with my language.

It will come as a surprise to many people who attend universities how precarious the employment can be for some of those who are delivering lectures.

During a hearing and in subsequent correspondence, it emerged that Maynooth University was operating a bizarre system whereby hourly staff were required to claim their holiday entitlements by submitting paper forms.  Hourly workers across society are more prone to being exploited and it is important in a forum such as our higher education sector that we have a robust system in place whereby people receive their entitlements.  As well as compiling the detail as to how many hourly workers institutes employ, I suggest we ask the HEA to clarify whether it can say with confidence that all workers with hourly-type contracts receive statutory holiday pay as of course, rather than having to implement some convoluted system for entitlements to be claimed.

In RT&Eacute;, there are people on genuine contracts on a temporary basis, but these were people who should have been directly employed.<\/p> <p>  The Eversheds report permitted this form of employment to go back a couple of years.  If it goes back a couple of years, but employees have essentially been in casual employment for six, seven, eight or ten years or whatever, that is the status they should have had for that time.  It follows from that that there are entitlements from being employed as opposed to being self-employed in the context of, for example, pension or welfare entitlements or whatever.  Essentially, it is to get to the net point, in acknowledging whether these 78 people were in permanent employment, that it is retrospective.

The correspondence indicates that three of the top ten earners are represented by the same agent, NK Management, which would appear to be a very successful rate if an agency delivers 30% of the high earners.<\/p> <p>  The fundamental issue that arises is that RT&Eacute;, even in comparison with other semi-State bodies, is unique, in that every household in the country is obliged to pay a charge for the running of that company and that company is also then charged with revealing information that is clearly in the public interest.  It is clearly in the public interest when a semi-State body has to make a voluntary contribution to the Revenue Commissioners because its policies were in breach of the law.  That is when a contribution and a payment have to be made to Revenue.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that the very people who would normally expose and investigate this work for the company involved and, therefore, there is an impetus and an obligation on RT&Eacute; to be more upfront than any other body in disclosing the exact nature of the payment.  The question we put was: how much has it already paid to Revenue?  That does not impede ongoing discussions RT&Eacute; is having with either Revenue or with the Department of Social Protection.  It is to outline how much has already been expended.  As Deputy Munster said, it took quite a number of different questions - and it was the Chair who eventually put the wording in such a way that RT&Eacute; had to respond - to find out that this payment had actually been made.  When I further pressed RT&Eacute; on how much that payment was, the response was that the information was not to hand.

We know that.  If the details were made publicly available, we would not have to ask for them.  In my view, it is unacceptable that RT&Eacute; would hide behind a disclosure provision that information not be made publicly available.  I agree with Deputy Munster's proposal that the committee correspond with Revenue on the general position.  Anybody who is knowledgeable in this area knows that if somebody makes a payment to Revenue, it will not publish the details in that regard, but it will not object to somebody else publishing them.  That is the course these matters take. <\/p><p> To maintain its integrity and reputation and its ability to investigate and challenge others, RT&Eacute; has an obligation to publish this information as a matter of urgency and without undue delay.  I suggest that the committee, in its correspondence with RT&Eacute;, outline in the strongest possible terms the committee's dissatisfaction that this figure has not been outlined as of yet and to ask for a timeframe as to when it will be disclosed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#G00900","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>To draw the pieces together on this matter, No. 588 from S&eacute;amus Dooley, the Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, is related to this matter.  It is brief, but Mr. Dooley states in his letter that he welcomes the interest of the Committee of Public Accounts in the issue of bogus self-employment which has long been of concern to the NUJ, the RT&Eacute; trade union group, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  He concludes that the Eversheds Sutherland process agreed with the RT&Eacute; group of unions is ongoing in RT&Eacute; insofar as the issue of retrospection remains unresolved.  I bring that to the attention of the meeting so that members will know where the process may be at.  Mr. Dooley clearly states that the matter remains unresolved.  He does not indicate that there has been any great progress on it.  With the agreement of members, we will take No. 586 from Mr. Dooley with this correspondence.  He has provided helpful information.<\/p> <p>  Arising out of the discussion on this matter, I cannot see why a public service broadcaster, which has made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners, an arm of the State that works on behalf of the taxpayer, cannot disclose to the Committee of Public Accounts how much of a settlement it made to Revenue.  I had to drag out of RT&Eacute; that it made a settlement.  We need to know the amount of that settlement and when it was made.  I propose that the committee secretariat correspond with RT&Eacute; advising it that we expect answers to those questions and that it is unacceptable that the committee has not received answers to date.

We have received a letter from the Department of Justice in regard to the legal costs and compensation paid in respect of legal claims managed by the Irish Prison Service.  The Department is very definitely saying that the Irish Prison Service manages that area but, as we know, the State Claims Agency will handle some of the claims.  This is a dangerous environment so there will be claims.  We need to make sure that where something happens, we try insofar as is possible to ensure that it does not happen again.  For example, there was a significant TB outbreak in one year.<\/p> <p>  That same correspondence references the number of claims and the number of them that were handled by the Prison Service.  Further on, it references the compensation paid in respect of claims in the years 2014 to 2020, and the number of claims and the amounts are provided.  There is a considerable difference between one and the other.  The other has to have been managed by the State Claims Agency.  It is difficult to properly interrogate this information in the absence of full sight of the issues that arose.  In one of the responses, there is a table which shows that exposure to behavioural hazards is pretty high, but one would expect to see that.  However, in the case of physical hazards there is no detail on each hazard or the response to make sure it has been addressed.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult when we get a set of figures and we can see the legal fees in respect to the claims managed by the Prison Service, but we cannot separate out the compensation or the legal fees from the point of view of the total compensation paid in terms of claims.  I would like to know the relationship or ratio in relation to the legal fees aspect.  Pretty often, legal fees amount to nearly as much as the compensation claim.  This is about how we change how we do things in terms of mediated settlements and so on, as opposed to cases going through the courts system or a very legal process.  We need some more information for those years from the State Claims Agency on the ratio of legal fees to compensation and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#H00500","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I will bring in Mr. McCarthy at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#H00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621931400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I want to point out to Deputy Murphy that there are two documents from the Department of Justice.

In relation to that, there are damages amounts, payments in relation to lack of in-cell sanitation and in relation to tuberculosis mass action.  Those are the State Claims Agency ones, whereas the ones in the letter itself are the ones that are handled by the Department.<\/p><p>There is the difficulty with any of this when one looks at it on a year-by-year basis.

For example, where a prison officer is injured in work and is out for six months, there would be medical costs and compensation paid.  What is the relationship between that and the legal costs?  Is there a kind of an open disclosure approach in the same way there is an acceptance of liability?  Does one cut down on costs by virtue of the fact that one does not have to be overly legalistic in some cases?<\/p> <p>  I am not saying that the State should roll over and pay compensation willy-nilly.

The catalyst for this examination was the recent significant increase in the remuneration for the post of Secretary General of the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  We also have correspondence before us today, No. 594B, from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, also declining the joint committee&rsquo;s invitation to appear before it on this matter. <\/p> <p>  However, I understand that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has now agreed to appear before the joint committee on 16 June and that the Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach will appear before the committee on 2 June.<\/p> <p>  The joint committee is awaiting a reply from the Secretary General of the Department of Health who has also been invited to attend the meeting on 2 June.  The joint committee is also awaiting a response from the Taoiseach's office as to when he will be available to appear before it on this matter.  As per our agreement with the joint committee, four members of this committee will participate in the meetings on this topic.<\/p> <p>  At our meeting last week, we agreed to write to the finance committee to convey our dissatisfaction with the fact that TLAC had declined the joint committee&rsquo;s request.  However, I understand the joint committee has issued another invitation to TLAC to appear before it on 17 June.  On that basis, it is not proposed to write to the joint committee on this matter.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to the Cathaoirleach of the finance committee about this.  He confirmed it had requested TLAC to come before it on 17 June.  In its correspondence, TLAC stated its remit is to recommended candidates to Ministers and the Government for the most senior positions but that it does not have a role in the remuneration, benefits and conditions.  It also stated it has no involvement in or knowledge of the processes or procedures by which remuneration, conditions or benefits are determined.<\/p> <p>  Given what has happened in this case, and as one of the four members of this committee who can attend joint meetings with the finance committee, I feel it is important TLAC appears before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#J00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the Committee of Public Accounts who are working alongside the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on this matter.<\/p> <p>  This is crucially important for all the reasons outlined so far.  I am glad to hear that the Minister has, after a little bit of persuasion, agreed to attend.  The very fact that he was refusing to in one instance is simply disgraceful.  Throughout this process when questions have been raised, either by this committee or on the floor of the D&aacute;il, senior Ministers have responded by implying that anybody who suggested that questions needed to be answered were undermining TLAC's authority to carry out its job and questioning the independence of the TLAC process.<\/p> <p>  It is imperative that TLAC answers questions on the rationale as to how it came up with the appointment that every single person knew it was going to make back in January or December when it was first announced as a temporary appointment.

The rationale given in December and January by the Government was that a figure such as this was needed in order to attract the best and the brightest in the world.  Little did we know that the best and brightest in the world was just around the corner from us all along in the form of a Secretary General in another Department.  Who would have thought it?<\/p> <p>  We need to get a further rationale as to the basis of that increase and why it was agreed and warranted.  Can we get some clarification or indication as to whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sees this increased salary provided for this post as the basis for future pay claims?  If and when a vacancy arises in another Department, will this pay scale have any implications for that?

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach were on the top tier.  Suddenly the Department of Health - perhaps it should have been at that level &ndash; has leapfrogged, very substantially.  There was discussion and concern about the knock-on consequences, and that increased salaries have been from the top-down rather than the bottom-up.  We know there are many people in various sectors who have been told that there are potential knock-on consequences.

Are members okay with correspondence No. 595B?<\/p> <p>  Correspondence No. 601B, which I referred to earlier, from Mr. David Gunning, chief officer of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, dated 19 May, provides information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the board on 9 February.  We requested this information on 16 February.  At this stage, it is well over two months overdue.  We note and publish this item.  Regarding this item of correspondence, No. 601B, from Mr. Gunning, chief officer, I do not know about the rest of the members, but I find this process totally unsatisfactory, that he answers and comes back on a number of issues we raised.  He raised an issue and quoted me as saying, \"As soon as the findings of that report are available, I ask that they be forwarded to the secretariat of the committee.\"  He answers that but he said that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board&rsquo;s analysis has been submitted to the Department of Health for independent analysis and scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  Members will recall that last November, we asked members of this board and a representative from the Department of Health to come before us.  They subsequently requested that the meeting be delayed until January because their report on progress of the children&rsquo;s hospital project was not ready, nor was there any indication of the final cost.  We put it back to January and they subsequently looked for it to be deferred to February, which we did.  Board members came before us on 11 February and at that meeting, they promised to have the report before us in March.  We are now sailing close to the month of June, halfway through the year, and we still do not have that report, and we do not have that board in front of us.  Board members were due to come before us two weeks ago, but they were not in a position to do so because the report was not ready.<\/p> <p>  The process has dragged on for an inordinate length of time.  I note that one of the central issues we raised with them on the day there were before us was in relation to claims made by the main contractor.  Many of us were surprised to hear that there were in the region of 700 financial claims being made by the main contractor against the board.  The reply in this correspondence stated that 450 of them entered a dispute management process.  Since the day they were before us, 100 extra claims have been made.  The correspondence goes on to state that there are now four cases, there were three, before the High Court and that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board initiated High Court proceedings relating to the contractor disputing the validity of phase B.  The board has initiated that case.  It is still of great concern.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that I am concerned about is that the position of chair has not been filled.  It is stated in the correspondence, that the previous chair, Fred Barry, indicated in January that he was to resign, and he bowed out in February.  It is understood &ndash; there is nothing definite about this - that the Public Appointments Service will work through the applications in the coming weeks and should a suitable candidate be identified from this process the names will be forwarded to the Minister for Health for consideration for appointment.

The AV room also has restrictions on the numbers that can attend.<\/p> <p>  It is possible to launch the report on Teams.  While we would need a committee room for it to be a public broadcast, we could also hold a launch on Teams that is not publicly broadcast.

At the previous meeting, we extended the speaking time for each individual group from ten to 15 minutes to include answers to questions and that worked well.  If the members accept that we do that, I will try and do that on this occasion.  In other words, as we rotate through the parties, the party and our witnesses have 15 minutes whichever way the party and, of course, the witnesses want to manage that, and after that we will rotate it.  As the members will be aware, there is a two-hour limit.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The rotation is as per the clerk to the committee has indicated.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome them to today's meeting.  I must read a privilege wording that I must say legally to the witnesses.  It applies to every witness.  It is not specific to the witnesses personally.  We say this at every meeting.<\/p> <p>  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person or entity's good name.<\/p> <p>  That is a standard speech I make at every meeting and there is nothing different about today as opposed to other days.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are very welcome.  I appreciate fully the difficult, hard-fought battle they have had for more than 50 years to get into the public domain the absolute certainty that their family members who died on that day were entirely innocent, that many of them were shot in the back and that it is a searing indictment of the crimes that were committed on their family members more than 50 years ago.  It was an indiscriminate use of force.  It was an atrocity.  It is a damning indictment of the past in our island.  I ask the witnesses now to make their opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#A00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here today about the Ballymurphy massacre.<\/p> <p>  On Monday, 9 August 1971, at 4 a.m., internment without trial was introduced by the British Government in the North of Ireland.  The British Army directed the campaign against the predominately Catholic community with the stated aim to \"shock and stun the civilian community\".  Between 9 August and 11 August 1971, more than 600 British soldiers entered the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast, raiding the homes and rounding up local men.  Many were brutalised without good reason as they were dragged from their homes.<\/p> <p>  In the aftermath of internment, 11 innocent civilians, including my father, were brutally murdered in Ballymurphy.  All 11 unarmed civilians were murdered by the British parachute regiment.  One of the victims was the well-known parish priest, Fr. Hugh Mullan, and another was 44-year-old mother of eight, Mrs. Joan Connolly.  All left their place of safety to go to the aid of others.  Almost all were shot in the back.  No police investigations were carried out and no member of the British Army was ever held to account.<\/p> <p>  Evidence suggests that some of the soldiers involved in Ballymurphy went on to Derry some months later and murdered 14 innocent civilians.  Had those who were involved in Ballymurphy been held to account, the events of Bloody Sunday may never have happened.<\/p> <p>  Original inquests were held into each of the deaths in 1972 resulting in open verdicts.<\/p><p>We always maintained that these were sham inquests as not all eyewitnesses were called to give evidence, and the RUC did not carry out any investigations into the 11 deaths.<\/p><p> In 1998, the families began a campaign to have their loved one's names cleared and declared innocent.  As part of that campaign, families started to source eye-witnesses, and to collect evidence and witness statements, which would later be submitted by our solicitor P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Muirigh to the Attorney General, with a request for new inquests.  Subsequently, the Attorney General exercised his powers pursuant to section 14 of the Coroner's Act (Northern Ireland)1959 and, having considered the submissions made to him, he directed in 2011 that new inquests should be held into the deaths of ten of the victims.<\/p><p> The first preliminary hearing took place on 3 March 2014 and the oral hearings began in court 12 at Laganside Courts on 12 November 2018, with an opening statement from counsel for the coroner followed by family pen portraits in respect of our loved ones.  The inquest heard 100 days of evidence, finishing on 3 March 2020.  On each day of the inquests we relived the horror of what happened to our loved ones in August 1971.  It was not easy, in fact it was awful, but what gave us the strength to get through it was the knowledge that every day of evidence was another blow to the Ministry of Defence web of lies created 50 years ago.  We remained determined and united as the truth was finally recognised by the court and the lies of the British Government were laid bare for all the world to see.<\/p><p> Last Tuesday, 11 May 2021, Mrs. Justice Keegan delivered her long-awaited verdict.  It was an historic day for families as they gathered to hear Mrs. Justice Keegan say that all our loved ones were innocent.  They are: Joan Connolly, innocent; Joseph Corr, innocent; Eddie Doherty, innocent; John Laverty, innocent; John McKerr, innocent; Fr Hugh Mullan, innocent; Joseph Murphy, innocent; Noel Phillips, innocent; Frank Quinn, innocent; and my daddy, Danny Teggart, innocent.<\/p><p> We were overjoyed at the verdict.  We corrected history.  We corrected the lies that our loved ones were gunmen and a gunwoman.  We always knew our loved ones were innocent, now the world knows it.  Our joy was interrupted when the British Prime Minister Boris Johnston issued feeble and insincere apologies.  We never asked for an apology, but we did ask for a police investigation.  The police have never investigated the deaths of our loved ones.  We should not need to ask for a proper police investigation: it is normal practice when citizens are murdered.  The British Government now wants to deny us and others any chance for justice by introducing an amnesty for these murderers.<\/p><p> The Ministry of Defence spin doctors, just like they did 50 years ago, are circulating lies, describing these investigations as vexatious or unfair prosecutions.  No one should be above the law.  Amnesties are for people who are afraid of the truth.  If the British Government is so proud of its legal system, why does it not trust it?  Instead it chooses to ignore the internationally recognised agreements and make up its own laws when it suits.<\/p><p> Every victim should have a right to pursue justice.  We will not accept an apology for these murderers and will challenge any attempts to do so.  I ask this committee to use its influence on the British Government to implement the Stormont House Agreement so that other victims do not have to endure many years of campaigning as we did. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank you, Mr. Teggart, for the very clear, concise, and deeply moving statement you have given to us.<\/p> <p>  All of our parties here will comment individually on their concerns and how they hope to bring about the objectives that we all want, which are accountability, justice, and reconciliation.

I wish to thank Mr. Teggart and our guests for giving of their time here this morning.  I thank them for their tireless campaign over the past 20 years, and over the 50 years since they were denied truth and justice for their loved ones.  I was honoured to have read the names of the victims into the Official Report on the night before the findings of the inquest.  We all felt for them that night and on the day when the families finally got vindication for their campaign, and their loved ones were found entirely innocent.  When someone is found entirely innocent then someone is entirely guilty as well.  Everyone should have access to an effective investigation into all of the Troubles-related deaths.  Every family bereaved in the Troubles should have access to effective investigation and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.  I am utterly against any unilateral move that changes the Stormont House Agreement, and what was a collective and comprehensive framework to deal with legacy.  I agree with Mr. Teggart that new lies are being told with regard to the rationale for seeking an amnesty.

That is exactly what has happened.  New lies have been started with these vexatious investigations.  One of the questions asked was about the difficulties then and now.  Things would have been different if we had had a proper investigation.  If the soldiers at one of these massacres had been properly investigated, and if the courts had been more sympathetic to the families without taking the word of the army at the time, I wonder how many people's lives would have been saved at the likes of Bloody Sunday and events all through the conflict of the Troubles.  The committee has to remember it was the army and the likes of its generals who were putting out statements about our loved ones right away, from the first shot, saying they were gunmen and gunwomen.  If things had been done differently in the courts and they had been made accountable, and if the Attorney General of the day had been more forthcoming for anybody who committed a crime, whether it was the army or whatever, things would have been different throughout the conflict.<\/p> <p>  Senator Currie also asked about what the committee can do for us.  Obviously the families have been successful in getting the inquest, in correcting history to show our loved ones were entirely innocent and in vindicating their good names.  We would hope the same help, the same resources and the same laws would be available to others.  Members have to remember the inquests at that time were a sham.  They did not call eyewitnesses.  Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh can expand on this.  The RUC did not interview military witnesses and things like that.  That is where we were at.  We were treated really badly.  One example of how the courts were, although it changed subsequently, was that when my mother went for a civil case at a very early stage she was told by the judge that because my daddy was not working at the time she would have one less mouth to feed and would actually be financially better off.  Those were the kinds of judges, and that was the kind of legal system, that we had at the time.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked how we were treated at the inquest.  From the very start the families had requested a meeting with the legacy department in the Laganside courts for the inquest.  It was very helpful.  It will set a precedent for what others should be entitled to.  They were very family-orientated.  They brought us all into the meeting and we asked for a few things.  We did not get them all but we got basically what was needed for the families, like a family room as somewhere for the families to go.  We brought in the Listening Ear service and things like that.  Even at the end, they familiarised the families with the courts.  All these things were done and I congratulate the coroners service on the way it worked with the families.  I hope it is the precedent for others coming forward.  I will give somebody else a chance to talk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>When Mr. Teggart is speaking, sometimes we can hear him very clearly and at other times we cannot.

The point I want to make on the inquests relates to the distress caused to the families.  There was a lot of information that we heard for the first time.  Our legal team were very good at showing us beforehand what would happen on a given day.  The issue was the attitude of some of the soldiers who were called, saying they could not remember.  It was the same thing right down the line and was actually put on a website.<\/p> <p>  The other point is that we were one of the lucky families, along with my neighbours, that actually had an inquest.  There are families who have not had any kind of recognition.  Their loved ones were there one day and then were murdered, and nothing has happened.  Early on in the Troubles, my brother's death was investigated by the royal military police.  That was the deal they had and it was all a cover-up system, as we now know.<\/p> <p>  I want to make the point that the Stormont House Agreement is there and the mechanisms are there, but people cannot move on.  People are stuck in the past because there has never been any accountability for what happened, none at all.  There was a letter sent to the Irish Government with over 3,600 signatures on it of people from all walks who lost someone in the conflict and are looking for some kind of accountability and justice.  That needs to be addressed.  The Stormont House Agreement needs to be implemented and the Prime Minister of England needs to be told quite firmly that there is no amnesty on the table.  That is how I feel.  He came out and gave an apology to the families which I found out about when a reporter rang me to tell me Boris Johnson was apologising to me.  This is the same way he will bring an amnesty in; through the back door.  The Oireachtas needs to push him on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Carmel Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>In reply to Senator Currie's question, any unilateral move to bin the Stormont House Agreement and bring in an amnesty for British soldiers would be a clear breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and also of international human rights standards.  These families will challenge any such move by the British Government in the domestic courts and, if they need to, in the European courts as well.<\/p> <p>  There was also a question on the conduct of the inquest and family participation.  There is no question that this coroner held an Article 2-compliant inquest.  Part of the procedural obligation under Article 2 is to involve the next of kin and we saw that throughout.  That included the pen portraits the families opened the inquest with, which was a new process which had not been used before at an inquest in this jurisdiction.  We had very practical arrangements at the inquest including appropriate seating arrangements for family members and the facility to have sight of civilian and military witnesses as they gave evidence when they were not screened.  It also involved a facility at the courts complex for tea and counselling facilities.  All of that was very important so I must commend the coroners service and the coroner in particular, who put the families front and centre of this inquest.  As Mr. Teggart said earlier, a precedent has been set going forward that families no longer have to feel that they are outside the legal system or that it is a cold house for them.  Mr. Teggart gave a very damning example of how they were treated in 1972.  This has changed and this coroner has set a very good example and high standard as we go forward.  I hope it is replicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Muirigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh.

They are very welcome.  I am sure they are exhausted because they have campaigned for many years to get justice for their loved ones.  They have not stopped since the announcement by Mrs. Justice Keegan a number of weeks ago that their loved ones were innocent.  They need to be commended on all their hard work and determination over the years.  They and other family members who are not here today have carried out their campaign with dignity and respect.  We are all appreciative of that work over the years.  Their composure has been overwhelming in the face of the casual manner of the violence perpetrated by the British powers who murdered the loved ones of our guests on their own streets.  They should be proud.  As a representative of west Belfast, I assure our guests they instil pride the length and breadth of the constituency and beyond.  On the day Mrs. Justice Keegan made her announcement, everybody in west Belfast was saying our guests had done it, they had done what they said they would do.  They have instilled pride in many people across this constituency and beyond, as I have said.<\/p> <p>  The hurt and pain of the massacre could easily have broken our guests' spirits.  The response of successive British Governments that claimed the victims of the massacre were armed and threatening could have left our guests in despair.  In actual fact, the opposite happened.  Our guests suffered loss.  They showed their love for their relatives and their desire to clear the good names of their loves one that were sullied by British liars.  They showed their dedication to the truth and pursuit of justice throughout the campaign.  They achieved the truth, which they rightly deserved.  I believe that for over 50 years the humanity in our guests' hearts lit up the darkness of the loss they grieved.  I welcome that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make one suggestion to the committee.  I suggest that we visit Ballymurphy as soon as possible when restrictions are further reduced to hear in person from the family members.  That is important.  When we are in Ballymurphy, we should also meet with the families of the victims of the Springhill massacre to hear their stories.  Springhill and Ballymurphy adjoin each other and, less than a year after the Ballymurphy massacre, five civilians were killed by the British army.  The Springhill massacre is often known as the forgotten massacre.  It would be good and useful for the committee to agree to meet the families in Ballymurphy and then meet with the Springhill massacre families.<\/p> <p>  My question to the families will touch on something that has been mentioned on many occasions over the years but I think it would be useful for members of the committee to hear this.  It is a difficult time for our guests and all the other families that were affected.  Will our guests tell us what it was like to cope with the loss of their loved ones in such a violent way and then to listen to the British Government and the powers concerned claim that our guests' loved ones were not innocent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Maskey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I will come in now and that will give the families and Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh a clear run at responding to the Chairman and Mr. Maskey.

Such determination is truly inspirational when we recognise the deliberate nature of the obstacles that have been placed before them by the British state throughout the past 50 years.  I also want to take a moment to recognise the work of Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh.  He is one of the few solicitors in this jurisdiction who are legacy practitioners.  They have been deliberately targeted and demonised by the state.  I often hear about history being rewritten and I note Mr. Teggart's opening comments about correcting history.  I pay tribute to the legal diligence that accompanied the families' determination.  Our history books now reflect what actually happened in Ballymurphy in August 1971 and that is something we should all welcome.<\/p> <p>  In the face of the difficulties the families have faced over 50 years, they still managed to get the truth.  My question will focus on the areas of justice and accountability.  The British Government has unilaterally walked away from legacy agreements and now seems set on implementing an amnesty that it announced on the very day that Mrs Justice Keegan declared to the world that the loved ones of our guests were innocent.  The British Government justified the amnesty by saying it wanted to help families to move forward.

It was very hard, I must say.  I was an 11-year-old boy at the time and I grew up angry about what had happened.  There was obviously not much I could have done, as an 11-year-old.  I heard my mummy crying in the night time.  She tried to be strong for the families.  There were 13 of us and we were split up to different sisters and things like that to try to help in some way.  I went to my sister, Alice's.  Others went to live with Bernie, some to live with Margaret.  The family split up as a mechanism of coping and sharing the pain.<\/p> <p>  Things like these affect people differently.  Some were determined to get the truth.  Others experienced mental health issues.  However, we got there through hard work.  As Mr. Finucane said, we have corrected history.  The British Government has walked away from its responsibilities.  We need a strong co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We need more pressure than words.  We have a strong friend in America at the minute from which support can be sourced.  There is a lot of support.  At the same time as the British were going to interfere with the Good Friday Agreement, there were some words about what can be done.  Those are the kinds of things we need to be doing.

In light of the damning findings by Mrs. Justice Keegan, that matter will proceed with vigour.

These families also have a right to an independent investigation, which never occurred, to examine the criminal actions of the British army over the course of three days in Ballymurphy.  Mrs. Justice Keegan highlighted many of those actions by the soldiers in her detailed findings.  The British Government's proposals on an amnesty will be vigorously opposed by the families when they come forward, and this committee could obviously play its part in supporting the families in that regard.  We will be calling, and we hope the committee will continue to call, for the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.

I was eight years old when John was murdered.  On the morning he was murdered, my other brother who was 18 years old was arrested.  My mother and father spent two days looking for them because they did not know where they were at the start.  Christmas 1971 really sticks out in my mind as an eight year old.  Terry was jailed on 18 December for riotous behaviour, a conviction that was quashed in 2015.  There was no Christmas tree in our house.  Our house was always full of activity because I was the baby of 11, but there was nothing.  It was like a silence came over our home.  My mother and father were totally devastated and just trying to cope.  The fact is that there were nightly raids on our home.  That was what the army did.  It targeted the homes of the people who were murdered.  It targeted them to try to keep us quiet.  It tried to demonise the families through the nightly raids.  It was just another way of trying to keep the families down.<\/p> <p>  My mother was never the same person after that.  When I went to school she collected me, we went to the graveyard and we went to mass.  That was my time as an eight year old, so I grew up with this.  It also has an impact on my life.  I am very conscious all the time of where my children are.  They are adults now.  I am very alert all the time and very anxious.  That was the impact it had on my life.  The rest of my older siblings were never the same again.  They did not live the lives they should have lived.  That is why I sometimes get very angry.  Not only did they murder my brother, they destroyed an entire family.  Being the youngest, I watched it.  I watched my mother slowly dying in front of me.  My father died at 61 years of age of a broken heart.  It was just horrendous.  That is why we got justice - that our loved ones were innocent.  We need investigations.  We will never move on.<\/p> <p>  My mother died in 2000.  I was holding her hand when she died.  That is the way she should have died.  I can accept that.

I must agree with Mr. Maskey's comments about the dignity and respect with which the witnesses have carried out their campaign.  It has been something else to watch.

Some have the view, even on this island, that achieving truth and justice is not really realistic at this stage and they question the merit of seeking inquiries.  Some are putting them down to the times they occurred, the Troubles and so forth.  How do those comments make the witnesses feel?  What is their opinion of people putting forward those arguments?  Some are also of the view that justice will probably not be recoverable, particularly under Boris Johnson's Administration.  Is truth recovery enough for the witnesses?  They represent an awful lot of people across the Six Counties, and some beyond, who are seeking justice and truth.  Some probably would be content with even just getting the truth.

What Ms Quinn said in her last contribution brought me to tears.  The dignity, respect and love the witnesses show their loved ones, as well as the loss, are clearly there in all their hearts.  They highlighted all the beautiful lives that were lost, but also the domino effect in the hurt, pain and legacy they all have to carry with them.  I am thankful that we have reached this stage with an inquest, but there is so far more to go.  The witnesses have quite rightly said that.  This country has been let down time and again by the British Government.  The disrespect the British Government has for Irish citizens and their lives is sickening to the core.  The value it has put on an Irish citizen's life is clearly not as important as that of a British citizen.  That is the bare fact, in my opinion.  We see the effect of legacy and the effect of not knowing what happened one's loved one.  The witnesses said that over 3,000 people signed the petition seeking answers about all the deaths in Northern Ireland in past years.

I welcome their comments very much.<\/p><p>The contents of Mr. Teggart's initial statement are very striking and clearly show the huge injustice inflicted on so many innocent people.  The taking away of the lives of those innocent people, and also the untold grief inflicted on the families of the victims by being denied the truth for 50 years, must be heartbreaking.  I know the Ballymurphy families have welcomed the inquest findings as a vindication of the innocence of their loved ones, and quite rightly.  They have outlined very clearly the absolute frustration that it took half a century to reach these findings.<\/p><p>In her report, Mrs. Justice Keegan also referenced the isolation to which some victims' families were subjected in their communities during that period.  We all know that losing a loved one - an innocent person - is just horrific.  Not having the truth told for 50 years must indeed be an unbearable burden.<\/p><p>I want to refer in particular to two comments made by Mr. Teggart in his opening statement, which I believe are as powerful as any I have ever heard at this committee.  He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe corrected the lies that our loved ones were gunmen and a gunwoman.  We always knew our loved ones were innocent, now the world knows it. <\/blockquote> <p>Nothing more can be said.  He encapsulated so well everything about the murder of innocent people and the families of victims being denied the truth for half a century.<\/p><p>Of course, the way the British Prime Minister and Government dealt with their so-called apology was totally undignified.  Other speakers quite rightly referred to the very dignified campaign in which the families engaged over the years.  I was privileged to meet the families in 2014 here in Leinster House.  It was clear at the time that they were going to search for and get the truth through a dignified campaign.  It is heartening to see the quality of the campaign led by the families.<\/p><p>I also hear, very loud and clear, the comments of Ms Quinn, Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh and Mr. Teggart regarding no amnesties for people who have committed heinous crimes.  I absolutely agree.  I believe we must never deviate from that position.  The witnesses outlining that point at committee sends a very clear message.  Amnesties are not acceptable.  I will quote Mr. Teggart again, when he said, &quot;We will not accept an amnesty for these murderers and will challenge any attempts to do so.&quot;  I wholeheartedly agree.<\/p><p>Ms Quinn, and in particular, Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh and Mr. Teggart, also referred to the Stormont House Agreement.  That political architecture is in place and it must be implemented.  Again, the witnesses have shown the great quality of their campaign, and the dignity of the families and campaigners, when they talked about other families and victims who also need to get the truth.  People who, unfortunately, have suffered in other atrocities have also been denied the truth for decades.<\/p><p>The witnesses' message about the Stormont House Agreement is a very strong argument from families of victims, alongside ourselves as public representatives in political life, in calling for its implementation.

One has to remember that this is the way the British Government works.  That evening, it took away the first payment that would have been made to family members.  A lot of family members could have used that for sending their kids to university and things like that.  That was the first thing to be implemented from the Eames-Bradley report.  It was taken off the table overnight by the British Government, without any reason at all.  That is how sincere it is about different agreements.  From then on, that has been the way it treats other agreements - with a long finger - and it has done so many times.<\/p> <p>  One must also remember other mechanisms that were put in place, such as the coroner's inquest coronial system.  People who should have known better tried to stop the inquest, and stop people like ourselves, because it was independent and because the evidence did not hold up.<\/p> <p>  The only way the British Government could have been involved in that at all was the lack of resources.  We had the Lord Chief Justice saying we need to clear up the deaths of 95 victims of the conflict and he was confident he would do it in five years.  There was a lack of resources, however.  It took us actually taking the Government and the First Minister to court for the release of the funding for the inquest.  We had to do that also.  They were actually choking the system so it would not work and they are still doing the same.  Many families are waiting on reports from the police ombudsman.  That office is severely underfunded.  That is the kind of thing the likes of this committee can also recommend.  These things are put in place to help victims like ourselves.

[need] the next thing - you want justice!\"  We are very realistic that justice is difficult 50 years later.  There are the obvious problems and obstacles, such as the lack of investigation at the time, which meant evidential opportunities were lost, and the issue of tracing soldiers when the Ministry of Defence has not assisted the coroner fully with the identification of soldiers.<\/p> <p>  We understand it is difficult.  We are realistic about that.  The investigative arm was central to the Stormont House Agreement for a reason, however.  To do otherwise would, in my opinion, undermine the rule of law and confidence in the justice system, which is very fragile in post-conflict societies.  It is very important that we do not measure this on numbers.  The right to justice and due process is something the families should have.

After going through the process and getting the verdict that he was innocent, I want more.  My expectations for my brother should not be any less than any other citizen's.  He was murdered.  Therefore, he should have justice.  Just because it was carried out by the British state, that should not be denied to me.  If any other citizen's life was taken, it would be investigated properly and there would be a conviction at the end.  I know that time is a factor, but the British strategy is to deny and wait people out.  This needs to be addressed.  I could not feel stronger about this.

I remember Mr. Teggart and the rest of the families coming to Derry many years ago and meeting the Bloody Sunday families.  They were walking a lonely road.  The Ballymurphy massacre did not have the same publicity as Bloody Sunday and other incidents.  It did not happen in front of the cameras and happened over three days.  When one reads through the evidence, the butchery that was visited upon those people in Ballymurphy was astonishing.  That evidence was gathered by the families and no one else.  The families had to do this themselves.<\/p> <p>  The British Government murdered these people's loved ones, then blackened their names and denied them truth.  Now it is trying to deny them justice.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  The ten people who were shot and murdered have now loudly been declared entirely innocent.  It is also important to remember Paddy McCarthy, who was a brave man trying to feed children on the streets of Ballymurphy that day and was violently harassed by the paratroopers to such an extent that he ended up having a heart attack and dying.  It is such a tragedy.<\/p> <p>  The bravery and tenacity shown by all of the families over the years are inspirational and something from which we should all take heart.  We must also be clear.  Like others, I am in discussions with the British Government.  It is absolutely determined to have an amnesty for everyone who committed murder during the Troubles.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  I have listened to well-meaning but naive people who always say that we can surely move on.  How can we move on if people are denied truth and justice?  We cannot get to the truth unless there are proper investigative processes.  We have tried asking nicely.  The British Government and paramilitaries are not going to come forward with the truth unless we drag it out of them, and the only way to do that is with a proper investigative process.  That is the only way the Ballymurphy families will get justice and many other families will get truth.<\/p> <p>  Right now, we need an urgent response from everyone in Dublin, America and across the world.  This minute, there is a determination by the British Government to close this down.  That is what it will do quickly.  If this committee can do anything, it is to be loud and determined about ensuring that the British Government does not get away with doing this quietly.  As Ms Quinn stated, the British Government will try to do this and we need to resist it at every single turn.<\/p> <p>  I thank the families for participating today.  It is not easy for them to have to keep going through this.  They should keep telling their story.  A couple of weeks ago, they believed they had a big victory.  They did, but the British Government rained all over that in the way it responded.  It is despicable that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to be dragged to the House of Commons and, when he actually made some sort of apology, it was not for the actions of the paratroopers, but for the way the investigations were handled or whatever he said.  I do not believe anyone expected much more of him, but it was still wrong and we have to keep saying that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colum Eastwood"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Eastwood and all the parties present.

It is humbling that, after the inquest, they are still here with us as we continue our campaign for justice.<\/p> <p>  I hope that, in some way, what we have done over the years can be continued for others.

They are very welcome here today.  I join with others in paying tribute to their courage and dignity over the past 50 years in what has been a very long and tortuous road to justice.  I turned 50 this year and feel quite old, which puts into perspective how long a period it is in terms of having to fight for truth and to fully get on record what happened on those days in August 1971, and what happened afterwards.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the witnesses are probably fed up hearing from Boris Johnson with his constant failures to properly apologise.  It probably affects a lot of questions as to how we can continue to highlight and showcase the issues at stake arising from what happened in the Ballymurphy massacre.  In particular, I am very conscious that while the so-called apology last week had the wrong focus there are substantive issues on how the Ministry of Defence dealt with the issue on the days in question, in the immediate aftermath and over the past 50 years, including right through to the inquest.  These aspects are probably not part of the public consciousness, particularly for an audience in Great Britain who see a situation where people were falsely killed.  They were innocent people.  The public do not have an appreciation as to exactly how the situation was so poorly handled by the UK state over that period.  So there is a job of work to be done to highlight and challenge those issues.  The Ministry of Defence, in particular, has been notable in its silence in the intervening days since the inquest itself.<\/p> <p>  Again, I want to stress my party's commitment to the Stormont House Agreement and keeping the prospect of justice very much alive.  Even if the actual real world prospects of prosecutions are slim it is important for all families right across the spectrum that that very much does stay on the table.<\/p> <p>  It is noticeable that whenever the UK Government has responded to the situation that it very quickly pivots to trying to offer an apology for what happened in Ballymurphy and then talks up what it is doing in legacy.  That shows a huge disrespect to the families in that they are linking the families' grief and fight for justice to what it is doing when it is very much at odds with the view of the families as, indeed, of many other people as to how legacy issues should be taken forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>As I took the Independents first last week I will take Aont&uacute; first this week after commentary by the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#H00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank Stephen for his kind words and, as always, he supports the families.<\/p> <p>  It is true that prosecutions should still on the table.  After 50 years people think that there is not much hope.  I think that after 50 years, like our campaign, there is hope because there is new evidence.  There have not been many cases where there has been no investigation at all, as has been said during the day here.  We investigated ourselves.  We went on foot, knocked on doors and found the evidence ourselves.  We brought that forward to Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh to legalise and the statements are with the Attorney General.  So there is hope even after 50 years but it is the kind of thing that the British Government wants to close.  The British Government is disrespectful, as has been said.<\/p> <p>  We must remember who the UK Government is trying to represent and support.  They are actually murderers and they are people who have committed crimes.  Our loved ones were entirely innocent of crimes.  The UK Government is trying to shield the people who committed these crimes from families and the families from them, because these people wore a uniform.<\/p> <p>  Our story has been told here today and we must remember everybody no matter who it is.  All of these families shed the same tears at the funerals of their loved ones.  All of these families have the same hurt and are affected in every way.<\/p> <p>  If one looks at what the parachute regiment alone did, twelve months after Ballymurphy there was Bloody Sunday.  Eleven months later people went to the Shankill and murdered Richard McKinney and Robert Johnston.  This was an elite force who should not have been on the ground in the first place.  Ms Briege Foyle, in her statement on the day, said that parachute regiment should be disbanded.  When soldiers are deployed on the ground in communities in the North then it is a military force, especially a combat force like the parachute regiment.  None of this should have happened and these murderers should not be shielded by any government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We greatly appreciate their attendance.<\/p> <p>  I have followed this campaign for the past two decades.  I am still absolutely dumbfounded that it has taken 50 years for justice to be recognised by the State in the North of Ireland.  There was an incredible injustice done to the victims on those three days.  That injustice was compounded by the defamation of their good names and compounded again by a 50-year wait for the truth.  Many people, when they look back on certain elements of the Troubles, view them as only existing in the past but this campaign shows that that injustice actually exists right up until now, which is an incredible thing.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the full political spectrum here has given such support to the families of the Ballymurphy massacre.  As has been mentioned before, there are many other groups of people in the North of Ireland who have been murdered, their families have been murdered, they have been absolutely wronged and they still seek justice; I am thinking of Kelly's Bar and Springhill.  The victims and their families of the Glenanne Gang where 120 people were murdered by elements and agents of the British state in a small location in the North of Ireland.  The father of an Aont&uacute; councillor, in Dungannon, was murdered in front of her when she was four yeas old.  Recently, she received death threats from the murderer of her father in the name of the East Tyrone brigade of the UVF.  For many people this injustice resonates strongly in their lives today.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest tributes that maybe the southern political establishment can make to the Ballymurphy families would be to make sure that no other campaign walks a lonely journey to justice in future.  We must ensure that all of those who seek justice now have the full energy of the southern State to make sure that they achieve justice for their families.  I would like to hear the voices of the witnesses on that matter.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say that it was the action of a rogue state when the British army murdered citizens in Ballymurphy.<\/p><p>The withholding of justice from families is the action of a rogue state.  The breaking of international agreements, such as the Stormont House Agreement, is the action of a rogue state.  That needs to be called out.  I propose that this committee take legal advice regarding what actions the Irish State can take to ensure that the British Government fulfils its responsibilities to the international agreements it has signed with the Irish State and with the parties in the North of Ireland.  The Irish State should use all the legal levers it has in the context of international law to ensure that the pathway to justice is achievable and not blocked for, or withheld from, any family in the North of Ireland and that agreements are not reneged upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#H00700","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Teggart, Ms Quinn or Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh, whomsoever might like to respond to that point, and after that will be Senator Black.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#J00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I think Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh could enlighten us regarding the legal aspects just mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I endorse the comments made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n concerning the behaviour of the British Government.

This might also be an aspect that the committee could raise, keep an eye on and request a formal response from the Irish Government, and keep in touch with the families.

It is very important that we hear their stories.  The dignified manner in which they have put across their stories and run their campaign has been an inspiration to everyone, right across the board.  Families across Tyrone and mid-Ulster have been inspired by the commitment and dedication of the Ballymurphy families to bringing about justice for their families.  It is important that we view this situation from that perspective.  Mr. Teggart, Ms Quinn and Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh are fighting for their families and to justify the innocence of their family members.  I reiterate that they have inspired people right across the board.<\/p> <p>  It must have been a roller-coaster of an experience for them, in the run-up to the inquest and then also in its aftermath.  Therefore, I thank them all very much for taking the time now to talk to us about the experience.  Their campaign has been undertaken on behalf of everyone looking for justice.  In that regard, we think very much of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The Irish Government has a role to play there to ensure that we do get justice.  One of the things which comes across to me is that it has taken 50 years to get this far.  However, if governments would get behind these campaigns immediately and fight alongside the families involved to try to get justice, that would serve to move things along faster.  <\/p> <p>  As Mr. Teggart said, the British Government has been happy to tell lies for the last 50 years and to spread the narrative that their families' loved ones were guilty.  The families fought very hard to get the inquest findings and in doing that they were pitted against the Ministry of Defence, MOD, the former Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, which did not undertake an investigation, and the British Government, which blocked progress in every way, including by blocking inquests and not providing funding for inquests.  All that sort of stuff has brought us to a situation where the families have now proved that their loved ones are totally innocent.  There are no ifs, ands or buts about it.  As others have said, the British Prime Minister, in particular, and the British Government then refused to be magnanimous and stand up and admit to that innocence the House of Commons, as other British Prime Ministers have done in the past.  <\/p> <p>  The British Government has a record of not implementing agreements.  It has failed to implement every agreement it has ever signed up to.  I refer to the Stormont House Agreement, the agreement concerning legacy issues, and it has never even fully implemented the Good Friday Agreement.  Under the auspices of New Decade, New Approach, the British Government agreed to legislate for legacy issues within 100 days, but it has again reneged on that commitment.  It is now moving to shut down the legal process, which was the only opportunity left to the Ballymurphy families and which was the avenue they had to use.  The criminal justice route, therefore, for the Ballymurphy families and others-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francie Molloy"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I apologise, but we cannot see Mr. Molloy.

I had the humbling experience of joining the families for a few days of the inquest and seeing first-hand what they were going through.<\/p><p>It resonated with me when Ms Quinn commented on the attitude of some of the soldiers, in respect of the witness statements given.  I found the reported attitude and demeanour of the soldiers to be most shocking.

The challenge being presented to us today is to determine how that justice can be delivered and to look at the deficit in the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p><p> My first question is as follows: can the witnesses put into words how the families felt when Ms Justice Keegan declared that all those who were killed were innocent and they knew they had succeeded in correcting the lies that demonised and dehumanised their loved ones?<\/p><p> I address my second question, in respect of the right of the families to an independent investigation, to Mr. Teggart.

I ask him to outline the terms of reference that would be required within that investigation.<\/p><p> I suggest that as a committee, on a solid and cross-party basis, we write to the British Prime Minister and specifically set out the actions that we need him to take at this moment in time.  Indeed, we should also set out the actions that we need our Taoiseach to take in terms of putting pressure on the British Prime Minister.  I understand Mr. Teggart's point that we need more than words.  We need to apply pressure.  I ask him to outline exactly how he sees that pressure from the committee manifesting itself.<\/p><p> I wish to thank the witnesses for attending the committee today.  I also endorse Mr. Maskey's idea of us visiting the sites of the Ballymurphy massacre and the Springhill massacre as soon as regulations allow us to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#J01400","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

She referred to the terms of reference for any investigation.  In short, those terms should be the opposite of what was provided in 1971.  It was a sham process whereby the police responsibility for the investigation of crimes was usurped.  There was an arrangement between the general officer command of the army and the chief constable, which meant that the use of lethal force by soldiers was investigated by the royal military police.  Throughout the Ballymurphy inquest, we saw that the royal military police was involved in the falsification of statements.  That became clearly apparent in the inquest.<\/p> <p>  What we need - and the Stormont House Agreement is a route to delivering it - is an independent investigation which has the appropriate powers to compel documents and witnesses.  That will not happen and there will not be co-operation, for example from the Ministry of Defence, unless the investigation is established on a statutory basis.  A multidisciplinary approach must be taken to the investigation.  It must have access to the forensic techniques that are required for any modern police-type investigation.<\/p> <p>  The key issue is independence.  The families have never had access to an independent investigation.  They have a right to that and deserve it.  We have a framework for the investigation in the Stormont House Agreement, but it has not been implemented.  Therefore, we ask the committee members to continue to call for the British Government to implement fully its responsibilities under the Stormont House Agreement.  We also ask members to oppose proposals to introduce an amnesty for deaths caused by soldiers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Muirigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Teggart or Ms Quinn like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#K00600","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>There is much to cover.  I agree with Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh on his point about the need for an independent investigation.  There are mechanisms that must be implemented.  The Stormont House Agreement and its provisions for setting up an historical inquiries unit must be properly implemented with acceptable leadership.  It would be good for those mechanisms to be put in place for a number of reasons, for people across the board.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned earlier the issue of funding for the mechanisms and the legal system.  Funding for the mechanisms that are currently in place must be backed up.  It must be ensured that funding for the likes of the offices investigating legacy cases is protected and not lost along the way.   <\/p> <p>  I mentioned earlier the issue of funding for those mechanisms and the legal costs.  The mechanisms that are currently in place need to be backed up.  It must be ensured that funding for the likes of th are not protected or lost along the way.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Molloy spoke about the journey of the families being like a rollercoaster ride.  It was an emotional rollercoaster.  We felt that we were hardened campaigners going into the inquest.  We thought we knew it all when we investigated the deaths of our loved ones ourselves.  However, once the inquest went into the detail of how they died, the pain and the injuries they suffered and how they were left to bleed to death in some cases, it was very challenging for the families.  We brought ten pictures of our loved ones into the courtroom.  The idea was to emphasise that they should not be thought of as another statistic, but as people who were murdered in Ballymurphy.  We brought in representations of who they were, what their characters were, who they left behind and how the families were impacted by it all.  It was a rollercoaster.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh mentioned cross-party support.  We can see that we have that support currently.  However, things need to be implemented.  The former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, Deputy McDonald and others have come forward and visited the sites in Ballymurphy.  They have walked in the footsteps of our loved ones.  If others were to visit the sites of the Ballymurphy and Springhill massacres, the families would welcome it and it would lift them greatly.<\/p> <p>  The murders in the Ballymurphy area are linked.  When my father was murdered, an 11-year-old boy was badly injured in the field alongside him.  He was actually an eyewitness to how the victims were treated by the army when the soldiers came into the field.  The boy's father, Paddy Butler, was murdered along with a priest exactly 11 months later on 9 July 1972.  Those murders took place in a small area.  The boy's father was murdered in the spot where John McKerr was murdered, outside the Corpus Christi Church.  Those murders took place in one area alone.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remember all the children, like Martha Campbell, who were murdered by rubber bullets and other weapons.  It was not just the adults who were murdered; our children were also murdered.  They were murdered in their own area.<\/p> <p>  When we were campaigning, I came across archives.  It has helped and will continue to help.  I must say that it was difficult when we turned our attention to the archives held by the southern Government.<\/p><p>I know the Dublin and Monaghan bombing families have encountered the same issue.  As I was saying, that needs to be more accessible.  Rather than requesting archive documents, they should be open to family members who are the experts on how their own ones died or on what information they would be looking for.  That is one of the things we found difficult when we went down to the South.<\/p><p> On the day that Enda Kenny came to Ballymurphy, he also met the Kingsmill families.  He said he would lead by example.  Here is what we need to do.  The Irish Government needs to lead by example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Quinn to make a contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#L00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions about how the families felt.  The night before, I did not sleep at all in anticipation of what would be delivered.  When Mrs. Justice Keegan delivered her findings, I felt overjoyed but also felt very sad.  Here we were 50 years later.  It was a lifetime - my lifetime.  My mummy and daddy were not there.  My eldest sister, Tilly, passed away on Christmas Eve 2014.  She had been through the courts with my daddy because my mummy was not able for the first inquest in 1972, which was a sham, as we all know.<\/p> <p>  The findings made me feel a bit relieved because my mummy had asked me and my other sister to prove to the world that her son was not on trial and was innocent, and we did that.  It was the same day that the Queen was making her speech.  We were waiting.  We had got these findings, we had the truth and we wondered if we would be denied justice.  The next day, when the Secretary of State for the Six Counties gave a so-called apology, it totally deflated the families again.  You are away up there, you are feeling, \"Right, we did this\", and you are deflated again because they have given you the truth but they are taking away justice.  As a family, we still feel we did that for my mummy.  We did that for my brother.  Now, we need accountability as a family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Carmel Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The Labour Party member is in the Seanad at present.

Such legal advice could be useful in relation to other matters in the Good Friday Agreement as well and the wider Brexit conversation.  That is a good idea.  Also, it would be useful as a topic for this committee to look at in general but that is a conversation for the committee.<\/p> <p>  It strikes me that the families here and the families of Ballymurphy are not alone.  The Bloody Sunday families in Derry had to walk a similar journey from the Widgery tribunal to the Saville inquiry.  We have seen obstruction by the British Government at every turn.  We only need look at inquiries such as the Stevens inquiries and the Cory inquiry where hard drives were seized and destroyed in the middle of an inquiry.  Every effort is being made to prevent inquiries or tribunals happening and, when they do happen, to obstruct them even if it is by sabotage, by arson or by theft of hard drives.  The lengths to which the British Government has gone to prevent the truth coming out are quite incredible.  Now, of course, we see the British Government trying to use the system, in terms of the amnesty and such like, to prevent again the truth coming out.  We have the Stormont House Agreement.  We have structures in that agreement that we should be using to help to establish the truth so that no family has to walk that lonely route, as one of the other Deputies said.  No other family has to wait 50 years or should be left waiting another 50 years.<\/p> <p>  One of the points I have been making is that it is not only the British Government we should be focusing on.  I do not want to let the British Government off the hook, but the Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Belfast Agreement.  One of the key parts in the Stormont House Agreement is the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, ICIR.  Something like this requires legislation in London and in Dublin and I do not see the progress coming from Dublin on this.  We need both but in reality we can start pushing ahead.  We can start having the conversation on what we want our legislation to look like and what we want our legislation to do.  The process of pre-legislative scrutiny that we use in this House allows those conversations to happen, allows a broad picture of legislation to be put out there and enables committees and expert witnesses to engage with it.  If we can begin that process, it gives us moral leadership here to say to London that it should get on with it and start doing what it needs to do for the families, for justice and to uphold its end of the agreements it made.  We should be looking at the legal route, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has suggested, but we also need to show our own leadership on this.  Other members and some of the families here have spoken about the need to be proactive and this is an example of how the Irish Government can be proactive in the need to confront.  It is an example of how we can use our action as a form of moral leadership to confront the British Government about its failure of leadership and action.  The Government needs to be shown to be proactive and we as a committee need to be making those demands of the Government and be proactive in making them.  There are other things that the Government can do to be proactive such as ensuring the funding, as has been pointed out.  It is a key part of making sure these things work.  We need to make sure they are funded properly.  These are things we can do.<\/p> <p>  Without trying to excuse the British state or let it off the hook for its failures time and again, we as a committee also need to be asking the Irish Government what is it doing, where its moral leadership on this matter is, where the consultation is on what the ICIR will look like, and where the heads of the Bill are so that we can at least have a conversation even if it is like the question of a border poll on which everyone is saying we need to be better prepared.  We need to be better prepared for the ICIR.  Part of the role of this committee should be thrashing these ideas out, as we do with any other piece of legislation.<\/p> <p>  I do not really have any questions.  Many of the questions I would have asked have already been answered.  I will wrap up now.  Essentially, the point I want to make quite strongly is that the British state has failed so many families who were seeking justice but we cannot let the Irish State off the hook.  As a committee, we need to be proactive in demanding the Irish Government is proactive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#L00500","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>For clarity, there are some members who have not spoken yet who have come in from the Seanad or elsewhere.

It is a bit awkward when the Seanad is sitting and we have to hop in and out on the Order of Business so I am sorry that I am coming back in late.  I will be totally honest.  To my utter shame, I was not hugely aware of everything that went on in Ballymurphy until the past few months.  I am from a Border area as well so there is no real excuse.  However, I think some of it is a generational thing because it happened 22 years before I was even born.  What the witnesses and their families have done over the past 50 years in continuing to fight for justice for their family members is so important in making people of my generation aware of the huge wrongs that happened 50 years ago.  I cannot imagine what it must have been like to go up against the full force of a state pushing against them to deny them justice and the rights to which they are entitled.  While the situation is not the same, I am reminded of the Ludlow family in County Louth.  One of their family members was murdered and they have said to me on numerous occasions that when their generation passes on another generation of the family will continue their fight for justice.  There are similar tones there.<\/p> <p>  To follow up on a few of the questions asked previously, do the witnesses feel the Government has been supportive in recent years?  Are there areas where we could be more supportive?  In what areas might the Government need to take a stronger stance to properly support the families?  Is there anything we can do as a committee or even as individual members that would be helpful in supporting them more often?

When the agency was first mooted in the national planning framework, it was quite clear that the purpose of the agency was to be primarily in the area of active land management, something for which the NESC, the ESRI, the Housing Agency and others have called for a very long time.  Under the previous Government, however, the LDA became far less an active land management agency and more a residential developer.  As a consequence, it has very weak compulsory purchase order powers.  It will not be able to work on land other than in active partnership with the landowner, whoever that may be.  Therefore, the original intention and something that is desperately needed, an active land management agency with strong CPO powers and a strong budget for land acquisition, public and private, is missing from the Bill.  This is the first in a series of amendments we are tabling to try to shift the focus away from residential development, which we do not believe the LDA should be involved in.  We think that should be the function of local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.  Instead, we want to insert in the centre of this legislation active land management policies, as other jurisdictions have, which play a very important role in bringing down the price of land, moderating development costs in the public and private sectors and making homes more affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#A01000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I will try to start in a positive vein because we have a lot of work to do to get the Bill through.  It is significant that this groundbreaking legislation is now on Committee Stage.  I look forward to working with colleagues of all parties and none to get the legislation through as expeditiously as possible.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has just raised a point about the provision of a budget for the Land Development Agency to capitalise the agency.  This can only be done once this legislation passes.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to change the name of the LDA, which was established under a statutory instrument in 2018.  This is an amendment about what the agency is called versus what it does.  What we are focused on is what it actually does, which is precisely to develop and manage State lands productively, to deliver affordable, social and cost-rental homes for our people, to get on with using the land banks we have and to work in partnership with our local authorities where necessary.  I still see local authorities as the main driver of social housing.  This amendment relates to what we should call this agency.  The LDA was established in September 2018 and, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin will know, has been progressing works since then on the number of sites over which it has a remit.  One in particular will break ground this year, and that in itself is significant.  The LDA is working in partnership with multiple stakeholders, local authorities and other State bodies.  Multiple public consultations have already been run since the agency's establishment.  We want to establish the LDA as a commercial State body under primary legislation.  The Bill deals with the LDA's corporate form and funding models among other provisions such as CPOs, which the Deputy mentioned and which were not provided for in the original Bill, and many very significant elements that will help drive forward development and land management, which the LDA has been actively involved in already through the register of public lands.  It makes sense that the Bill should be named after the agency it seeks to establish so, fundamentally, I genuinely do not see any merit in accepting this amendment and will oppose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#A01100","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>As I said, this is the first in a series of amendments that seek to shift the focus of the Bill onto active land management.  I will move on to my second amendment in this grouping, amendment No. 13.  The Minister will be able to see very clearly what we are trying to do here in respect of active land management.  The function of the agency should be to assemble land and, as amendment No. 13 makes clear, to make that land available to local authorities, approved housing bodies, community housing trusts and other not-for-profit bodies.  Key is that this is not simply a symbolic issue of the name of the agency; it is what we want this agency to do.  I do not believe a commercial entity operating through designated activity companies is the best way to use public land.  I do not believe allowing any of that land to be used for the development of unaffordable, open market-priced homes that could cost anything between &euro;350,000 and &euro;500,000, depending on the location, is good.  It does not matter if it is 10%, 20% or 60%.  Therefore, this is a fundamental issue of what we want this agency to do.  It is not just about the title; it is about the functions and the output of that.  The LDA does not have the capacity, staff or planning expertise for residential delivery.  We have great local authorities, AHBs and other entities that already have all that.  What they do not have is a willingness on the part of central government to fund them to deliver large-scale developments of mixed-income and mixed-tenure housing for social and affordable rent and affordable purchase.  That is why this series of amendments - and we will come back to this at later stages - is about essentially trying to redirect this Bill into what its function should be, that is, active land management to assist public housing bodies to deliver public housing rather than essentially a publicly owned private company that will use private development methods and finance, which will push up development costs and even make the affordable homes less affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#A01200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>This goes to the heart of what the differences are between the Government and the main Opposition party.  Our public deserve better and they want to see the lands we have developed and put to productive use for homes, affordable, social and cost-rental, for our people.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 13, and the other two related amendments tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, would fundamentally change what this agency is meant to do.  The Deputy said that clearly and that is fair.  It would, however, put this process back significantly and add further delays with regard to the delivery of public homes on public land, which is something I, as Minister, and most Deputies, could not really stand over.<\/p><p> Let us just understand what the agency will do.  This will deliver homes in addition to what our local authorities and approved housing bodies will do.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned supporting and resourcing those agencies.  I will remind the Deputy that in this year's budget, we have the largest single housing budget in the history of the State to deliver 9,500 new builds and social homes through our local authorities and approved housing bodies.  We need to build up their capacity too.  Let us not fool ourselves that the capacity to deliver homes is there in every local authority.  It is not; we must work to build up those resources.  Second to that, however, is actually looking at the other land banks that the State and other State agencies have.  A good example are the sites the LDA has already.<\/p><p> Take the Shanganagh Castle development, which the Deputy's party delayed a number of times.  We hope to break ground on that this year.  That will be done in partnership between the local authority and the LDA.  In many instances, however, the LDA will be developing and delivering lands that are not local authority lands.  They will predominantly be State agency lands.<\/p><p> This amendment actually seeks to delete all references to development and regeneration by the agency, which I find pretty remarkable.  The agency should be able to develop and regenerate relevant public land.  What Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking to do, however, is replace this with a provision to make such land available to local authorities, approved housing bodies, community housing trusts and other not-for-profit bodies.  I am tasking our local authorities to deliver and develop on their own lands.<\/p><p> I was in the Deputy's constituency in Clondalkin last week, where 12,000 homes are going to be delivered, both affordable cost rental and private homes, between the local authority and approved housing bodies.  That is a good thing.  The Deputy is saying now with this amendment that the LDA would effectively manage the land bank and hand it over.  I see it actually putting real homes on the ground for people in a short space of time.  Passing this amendment would, therefore, fundamentally change what we are trying to do here.  It would change the direction of the agency completely and delay the provision of homes for an inordinate length of time.  I would like to think that is not the reason for this amendment.<\/p><p> I will move on to the other two amendments within the grouping.  Amendment No. 33 seeks to amend section 2, which would provide that relevant public land would be used by local authorities, approved housing bodies, community housing trusts and others.  Amendment No. 77 would do the same thing.<\/p><p> All those amendments will actually remove the building aspect that we want the LDA to do in partnership with smaller builders and local authorities to deliver homes for people.  These are fundamental to how we go forward.  If people look at them with any degree of detail, they will see that passing these amendments, which have been tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, will actually stymie the agency and delay the delivery of homes in the middle of a housing crisis.  That is not something I or this Government will stand over.  I am, therefore, opposing these amendments.<\/p><p> To be frank, it should really be clear to people that the development and regeneration of relevant public lands is one of the most important purposes of this Bill.  The LDA has been tasked with enabling such developments.  To remove a reference like that from the Bill serves absolutely no purpose other than trying to fundamentally change what the agency is about.  It is basically going back to square one and losing all the time that has been worked on in establishing this agency.<\/p><p> I will go back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's very first point about giving the agency a budget and capitalising it.  If this were to happen, it would not really be developing anything.  What, therefore, would it need?  Would it just be an administrative body?  I do not believe that is really what people want.  It is certainly not what I want.<\/p><p> Furthermore, one of the primary purposes of the legislation is that where relevant public land is underutilised, the LDA will be able to acquire it for the purposes of development for housing.  I cannot see why anyone would disagree with that.  The LDA will not be replacing the role of local authorities in any way, shape or form.  Indeed, under section 14 of the Bill, the LDA will work with and assist them in the development of larger-scale sites.<\/p><p> I will repeat again, however, that local authorities will be the prime deliverer of social homes and direct build affordable homes on their own land.  Of course, it has to be and is open to the LDA to also work with other housing bodies as they develop sites.  It is not appropriate, however, that the housing development functions of the LDA be removed or reduced as that will honestly play a real and vital role in delivering much needed homes.<\/p><p> Why would one set up an agency and then tie one of its hands behind its back?  It does not make any sense, frankly.  This may point to the fundamental difference in delivery versus dogmatism.  I have tried to outline that having a land development agency that cannot develop or build is an oxymoron.  For those reasons, I must oppose these amendments.  They are fundamental.  I see them as a potential mechanism to stymie the agency and that is not something we can countenance in Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#A01300","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

As the Minister said, the debate around these amendments relates to the fundamental differences between the Government and many in the Opposition in terms of what a land development agency should do.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that the Minister mentioned the Shanganagh Castle development as an example of a fundamental difference.  Shanganagh Castle shows exactly that the LDA is now replacing the role of the local authority.  To put the Minister straight, the Opposition parties certainly did not delay the development of Shanganagh Castle.  I was campaigning to get public housing on the Shanganagh site from the moment it was handed over by the Department of Justice to the local authority 15 years ago. <\/p> <p>  Since then and up until now, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has continued to be run by a combination of Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael-led councils.  In all those years I campaigned to get public housing on that site, we never got a sod turned.  Some of the time, it was because of the lack of enthusiasm from the Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael-led councils.  Most of the time, it was a combination of that with the failure of central government to offer any money to do it anyway.  I can, however, tell the Minister that those of us who now feel there needs to be a different role for the LDA were precisely the ones who were campaigning for public and affordable housing on that site.<\/p> <p>  Of course, what delayed it was the policy that was introduced, of which the LDA is the latest and most developed example, of insisting that private money came in on the development of the site.  There was an established pathway to sourcing money for the solely public development of a site whereby one applied to central government, which approved money because it was public housing.<\/p><p>What has stymied and slowed it to the point where we still do not have a sod turned 15 years on was the insistence that in some shape or form the site had to be marketised and private finance had to be brought in.  Then we had years of Departments and local authorities scratching their heads and asking how they can make it work if they bring private finance in.  Private finance completely skews the pitch because it has a completely different objective and approach from what a local authority has and to the way local authorities traditionally build public housing.  It ends up in a scenario with all these different tenure types, different financing models, different notions of affordability, references to the market and all the stuff that has been crystallised in the Minister's Bill.  The LDA is substituting for the local authorities, it is delaying the delivery of public and affordable housing and it is effectively a marketising of public land with the replete references in this Bill to local market conditions, market rents, market prices and all the things that should not be relevant at all to the development of the public land bank.<\/p><p> What should the Land Development Agency do rather than what the Minister is proposing it will do?  It should aggressively go after the speculators, land hoarders and people sitting on vacant buildings.  It is infuriating to people when they look at empty buildings being sat on by speculators and investors.  They want the State's Land Development Agency to go after these people and take the empty buildings and zoned building land they are sitting on and drip feeding into the market at a pace that suits them to keep land prices up and essentially manipulate the market.  That is what we want a Land Development Agency to do.  That was the general thrust of the Kenny report many years ago.  We do not want a Land Development Agency as a substitute for the local authorities or to marketise public land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#B00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy &Oacute; Broin to respond on amendments Nos. 13, 33, 34 and 77.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#C00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I will speak to the three amendments of mine.  A change in this Bill does not in any way delay any development.  In fact, if you take Shanganagh Castle as a case in point, it is the involvement of the LDA that has delayed that development by more than three years.  To their great credit, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councillors unanimously approved a broad outline of a scheme for Shanganagh Castle as far back as 2017 and 2018.  They did so because of really good work by councillors from all parties and none, including my party colleague, Shane O'Brien, who was formerly on the council.  Not once has any council member of any party delayed that development.  The delay first arose because former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, would not fund D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to deliver the scheme the councillors unanimously agreed some years ago.  Then, because of the LDA's involvement, it was delayed even further.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council had been the lead agency in that scheme and it put in the planning application.  It was the county architect who did all of the heavy lifting, and as that scheme progresses, the LDA will have to hire in consultants and project managers etc., many of which the local authority has in house.  In fairness, the Minister is not responsible for this delay but it was his predecessor who delayed Shanganagh Castle.<\/p> <p>  The two difficulties we have with that development are that the cost of the affordable cost rental properties are very high at &euro;1,200 per unit.  The design standards for the apartments are for smaller build-to-rent apartments, which is problematic, and we still do not know the price of the affordable purchase homes, which is genuinely problematic for folks.<\/p> <p>  With respect to Kilcarbery in my constituency, which the Minister mentioned, that is a good argument as to why the model the Minister is outlining in this Bill should not proceed.  We should keep in mind that Kilcarbery is not an LDA site.  Again, the previous Government would not fund a development on that site with 30% social housing, 30% affordable rental housing and 30% affordable purchase housing, for which we campaigned for years, and so South Dublin County Council was left in the situation of selling 70% of the land to a private developer.  None of the homes on that site will be genuinely affordable because the local infrastructure housing activation fund money will be used to give a small discount on the market price of some of the homes for sale but they will still be in excess of &euro;300,000 and the bulk of those homes will be pushing up towards &euro;400,000.  That is the market price there.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also mentioned cost rental and, again, this is an interesting example of how backward Government policy is on this because South Dublin County Council was forced to sell that land at open market value.  A developer bought that land and built out houses and now the Minister, through the cost rental equity loan, has given an approved housing body money to buy back, at full market value, a property to then rent out at cost rental.  The consequence of that is that the rents are too high.  Those rents should be well below &euro;900, particularly out in the suburbs, but I estimate that they will be somewhere in the region of &euro;1,200, which is not far off some of the market rents in those areas.<\/p> <p>  There is this mad situation where the Government had public land which it could have built on.  It could have rented out and sold those homes at genuinely affordable prices and it has failed to do so.  The only delay I am aware of on any site, and this is directly relevant to these amendments because it may become a site the LDA is interested in, is Oscar Traynor Road.  As the Minister knows, a majority of Dublin City Council councillors, including those from Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats, left-wing parties, Independents and half the Fianna F&aacute;il team, voted against a proposal that would have seen a significant number of the homes there sold at unaffordable open market prices.  Councillors have worked hard and have worked up an alternative proposal.  My understanding is that the mayor, Councillor Hazel Chu, and the chair of the strategic policy committee, the Labour Party's Councillor Alison Gilliland, have forwarded that to the Minister and have repeatedly been trying to get a response from him to see if he will fund that development.  If the Minister funded that development, 100% of the homes on that site would be affordable instead of 50% of them, and it is questionable whether 50% of homes will be affordable.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is right that these amendments up to No. 75 show the difference but the delay in all of these sites is down to ten years of delay on the Fine Gael side.  We need to hear from the Minister that where a local authority has a site and where there is a majority or unanimous support from elected members to develop a fully affordable scheme with genuinely affordable prices at that site, we need to step up to the plate and fund it.  The difficulty with the LDA Bill and with these sections we are trying to amend is that if this goes through, not only will those developments be further delayed like in Shanganagh but the cost to buy and rent the homes will be way above what modest income working families and many other families can afford.  Therefore, I will be pressing all of these amendments up to No. 75.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#C00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>It is interesting, and as we go through these amendments, we have to make some progress in the debate.  Some of the discussion we have had for the past ten minutes relates to developments that are up and running or are not based on the legislation which we are passing here.  There is an assumption that the way things have been done for the past ten years is the way the Minister intends to do things going forward.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the wording of the legislation itself, it does not relate to any of the things the two previous speakers have spoken about.  There is an assumption they will be in all cases private, for-profit and specific purpose vehicles.  I am not sure how one could deliver affordability with that and therefore I am not sure how a Government would put that forward as a proposal.  It is not the intention of the Government that we would squeeze profit out of the land because then we would not be able to deliver affordable homes for the people who we want to deliver them for.  It is a bizarre concept that a Government whose job it is to deliver affordable housing for people would in some way side with private, for-profit international finance rather than the people they are elected by.  I appreciate that suits the narrative of our two previous speakers, but if we look to the actual wording of the Bill in front of us. it would seek to do something fundamental.  It would seek essentially to establish a quango that pulls together banks of land and acts as some sort of middleman between that land being developed and local authorities that do not have the capacity to develop it.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps those in Opposition do not realise it but we have a real capacity issue.  We need all cylinders firing and that includes the LDA, the local authorities and the approved housing bodies all in operation.  I just cannot fathom the idea of preventing the LDA from building homes.<\/p><p>Why would we prevent a body from developing homes when we know we need both local authorities and the LDA developing?  There has been a large amount of discussions on some developments here and council decisions.  Having served on a council, one only sometimes really know why a decision is made at council if one actually attended the debate.<\/p><p> Let us be honest, specific purpose vehicles are well used by our local authority sector.  The last time Fianna F&aacute;il was in government we built many thousands of homes in Ballymun using a specific purpose vehicle, which was Ballymun regeneration.  There was no private element to that at all.  For us to do what the amendment suggests would limit our ability to deliver and reduce the number of affordable homes that could be delivered.  There is no reference to the make up of the designated activity company or DAC so to remove the power of anybody to use a specific purpose vehicle, when we know that they are well established, would stymie progress and delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#C00400","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Deputy McAuliffe has covered the issue really well.

We have had a masterclass in sophistry from the Minister and of course he thoroughly misrepresented the situation.  The original proposals, quite a long way back, for the development of Shanganagh were to have private development.  The People Before Profit Party in particular tabled motions insisting that the development would only be public and affordable.  Then there was a big battle on the council and eventually that position was won.  The original plan, even before the LDA, was to have some of the site privately developed.  Yes, we, through campaigning and very significant local public anger at the thought that the site would be in any way privatised, forced a position where there was finally a commitment that the site would only comprise public and affordable housing.<\/p><p><font color=\"#4F4F4F\">  What I am worried about, given the make up of the LDA, is that the victory in establishing that the Shanganagh site will only be public and affordable will unravel because of the insistence in this Bill about relating affordability and rents to local market conditions thus rendering references to &quot;affordable&quot; meaningless in the context of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency.  Of course, our rents and market houses prices are so off the Richter scale that about 99% of working people are excluded from the market.  If, as this Bill proposes, that affordable purchase, affordable or, indeed, even rents, as the Bill explicitly states, are related to local market rents and prices then the affordable will not be affordable either in terms of house prices or rents.  So that is why, just to explain to the Minister, my later amendment is an attempt to put an insurance policy in against what the LDA might do to a hard-won position of establishing Shanganagh as a 100% public and affordable site.  That position was won in the teeth of very significant opposition from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#D00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>On the Minister's point about delaying, I will use the example of the LDA's site at St. Kevin's Hospital in Cork.  I, my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and other people in the Opposition proposed the development of this site back in 2013.  The site is being developed now by the LDA but we still do not have a breakdown of how much is going to be affordable, affordable cost-rental or purchase, social and private.  I am a Deputy for Cork North-Central yet I still do not know what the breakdown is.<\/p> <p>  There was an announcement at one of our housing meetings where it was said that the rental income will be between &euro;900 and &euro;1,000.  For the people of Cork North-Central whom I represent, that rental figure is not affordable cost-rental or affordable for people.  The Government is using the concept of giving a discount on the market value, and this goes to the whole crux of where we are coming from.  Affordability should not be based on market value.  It should be based on what is actually affordable for people.  If we are saying that it should be a maximum of between 30% and 35% of a person's income then how can we say this is affordable if we are using the market as the guide?  It is wrong for the Minister to say that we are trying to delay things when the Fine Gael Government, that was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, sat on its hands for years while I and all of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues sought the development of this site and other sites.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Cork City Council cried out for funding for years to develop sites.  If we want to provide funding to the council to deliver houses then local authorities should be funded.

First, because the LDA, as designed by Fine Gael, was to become a residential developer, it could not have significant active land management powers.  Earlier the Minister said that the Bill has compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers.  It does but they were always going to be in this Bill.<\/p><p>We were told by the former Minister, former Deputy Eoghan Murphy, it was his intention to put them in.  Those compulsory purchase order powers are only for small ransom strips to unlock development on public land and therefore one of the crucial functions of an active land management agency is to have strong CPO powers to ensure reluctant participants in better use of public land can be forced to the table.<\/p><p> The reason the Land Development Agency, as currently constituted, cannot do active land management in a serious way is that it would breach state aid rules and it would end up in the European Court of Justice challenged, as the National Asset Management Agency was, by other developers.  That crucial function that every body tasked by the Government to look at this question has been calling for over decades cannot happen as a result.<\/p><p> Deputy McAuliffe seems to think an active land management agency would just be some kind of quango or intermediary.  The National Economic Social Council, a function of the Department of the Taoiseach, has repeatedly called for and produced detailed documents arguing why an active land management agency would be central to tackling the unfortunately too cyclical nature of our housing market.  Likewise, other agencies have indicated that having an active land management agency, which would be powerful and well-resourced, to deal with land issues is crucial in moderating private prices as well as public sector development.<\/p><p> The other problem with having the Land Development Agency is that it splits the cost rental from social properties.  Dublin councillors have not agreed to transfer the St. Teresa's Gardens site to the Land Development Agency, LDA, but it is on the LDA website as one of the potential development sites.  St. Teresa's Gardens looks like a really good project, at 30% social and 70% affordable rental.  The local authority did a good deal with Hines, an adjoining developer, to swap some land in exchange for community facilities, and I commend it on that.<\/p><p> Dublin City Council is discussing bringing in the LDA to deliver that site because it would be faster as the LDA does not have to adhere to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's four-stage approval, tendering and procurement process and the public spending code to the same extent.  The consequence of bringing in the LDA means there is a split between the social rentals, brought back as turnkey projects by the local authority, which will manage them, and the cost rental projects that will be managed by the LDA.  At a certain point, those LDA cost rental units will generate a revenue surplus, and in all other countries with a cost rental model, that revenue surplus goes back to the overall housing provider to help manage and maintain the stock into the future.  Separating cost rental and social rental makes no sense.<\/p><p> This would also increase the cost of development.  The LDA will bring a certain private sector ethos and, in some cases, private sector or equity finance alongside its capitalisation.  That will make units more expensive and push up rents and house prices.  It is why the agency cannot tell us what is the sale price of the affordable purchase homes in Shanganagh Castle in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.<\/p><p> To correct the Minister's comment, there shall be no homes complete and ready next year at the Shanganagh Castle site.  Representatives of the LDA came in front of this committee and told us the first phase will be delivered in 2023 and it will be approximately a third of the scheme at 200 to 300 units.  There shall be further phases in 2024 and 2025.  The output for the LDA is looking exceptionally poor and that is the problem with it.<\/p><p> There is nothing wrong with Deputy Boyd Barrett being pragmatic and many of us will be pragmatic as we go through this.  We will table amendments to shape the legislation the way we would like it to be in an ideal format but we will also table other amendments - sometimes called defensive amendments - to at least improve what we think is a bad scheme.  When we get to the next group, we will see quite a number of those from me.<\/p><p> I do not want the LDA to be involved in residential development.  It is time we funded our local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts to do that.  If there is to be an LDA, I make no apology for tabling amendments to try to ensure it acts in ways it otherwise would not if left to the devices of the current Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#D00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Active land management is key and this is missing from the Irish context in housing delivery.

Is it because of EU state aid rules or is that a factor in the consideration of how the legislation has been drafted?

Deputy Gould spoke about cost rental and how it is framed.  I will welcome his party's support for the Affordable Housing Bill because cost rental will basically cover the cost of the development and maintenance of those properties, with rent set accordingly.  The Deputy continues to mention a discount on market value but that related to setting a guide for the first eight schemes being delivered within a year of the Government being established.  We are going to deliver eight cost rental schemes across the country, including in his own county of Cork.  That is something one would expect Deputies to welcome but obviously not in this instance.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to land management and assembly and the report of NESC and the national planning framework.  The Land Development Agency does exactly that and it will manage, assemble and develop.  It is quite a startling admission by Deputy &Oacute; Broin that he does not want the LDA involved in residential development.  In itself that is a very stark comment and people can now see that we will effectively have a State land development agency that would not be able to build if the Opposition got its way.  I speak specifically about Sinn F&eacute;in because these are Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  That can be put in the context of the very same Deputy saying he wants to deliver 20,000 public homes per annum, although he never says how, where or how long it would take.<\/p><p>Getting back to the reality, it is about how we deliver and get to the stage of building homes on public land.  It is intended that the Shanganagh Castle development will break ground this year and it will be very significant.  It is one of the nine significant sites that this agency has and I intend it to have many more while working in partnerships.<\/p><p>To respond to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's comments, the LDA at this stage has appropriate CPO powers for what it needs to do.  That is an important change from the last LDA draft Bill in the previous Oireachtas.  There are a number of changes in that regard that we will get to as we go through the Bill.<\/p><p>I will address amendments Nos. 44 and 46, which are tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould, along with amendment No. 45, which has been tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues, Deputies Gino Kenny, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Mick Barry.  I oppose the amendments as amendment No. 44 seeks to remove section 2(<i>r<\/i>), which enables the LDA to engage in commercial activities consistent with the parameters of the Bill.  Amendment No. 45 seeks to limit its commercial activities to the provision of social, affordable and cost rental housing.<\/p><p>The LDA has been set up as a commercial State body and its primary function is to develop but also to manage relevant public land, and where applicable, other lands for the provision of housing for the public good.  I see it expanding into that space.  It is wholly appropriate for the body to do that.  I reassure Deputies that any returns made by the LDA, as referred to by Deputies, will be reinvested in operations or returned to the Exchequer.  The legislation further provides that the only shareholders will be the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I oppose this amendment as by enabling the LDA to engage in commercial activities, it will have access to wider funding streams that will allow greater investment to achieve its aims and expand its functions.<\/p><p>That is something we should be seeking to do.  Should this legislation be passed by the Oireachtas, we will be able to capitalise the LDA through the ISIF to the tune of &euro;1.25 billion and further borrowing to an equivalent amount.  That is something I thought all Deputies would welcome because it allows the agency to get on with it.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 46 seeks to delete section 2(s).  This section provides that one of the purposes of the Bill shall be to achieve the best possible social and economic return from the use of relevant public land.  I oppose the amendment as the LDA is being entrusted with public land and it is appropriate that it should be required to achieve the best possible social and economic return on behalf of the people, with the focus being on the social return, that is, delivering both social and affordable homes on public land.  I said this on Second Stage as well.  I envisage the absolute predominance of the developments, particularly in urban centres, being up to 90% affordable and, indeed, a 100% mix of social and affordable.  That will happen, but it will only happen when we establish the agency with a primary legislative footing.  Development of much-needed affordable housing would be a beneficial social return, as would be the development of enabling infrastructure.  The LDA will be established as a commercial semi-State body and as such will be required to achieve a return on the investment made in it by its shareholders, the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a commercial semi-State body, under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, the LDA will be in receipt of a shareholder letter of expectation which will detail the return both Ministers will expect from their investment.<\/p><p> The agency will be governed by the public spending code, as members know, and will be fully subject to public procurement.  Any suggestion that it is exempt or beyond that is wholly incorrect.  Members also know that.

First, it is important to remember that the LDA was established in September 2018.  It will be five years before it delivers a single home.  That does not appear to suggest it has either the capacity, ability or the urgency to meet the challenges of the housing crisis.  In fact, if the former Deputy, Eoghan Murphy, had funded D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to develop Shanganagh Castle when the elected members of that local authority unanimously agreed on a very good scheme, people would be living in the first tranche of those homes today.  Therefore, the argument that it is quicker to set up a new State agency to deliver homes rather than funding the local authorities directly to deliver large-scale projects is simply not the case.<\/p> <p>  One of the worries I have about LDA sites, for example, the Dundrum central site, which will be one of the key ones in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, is that we do not know yet, because we cannot be told either by the Minister or the agency, how many or what percentage of the homes on that site will be at an unaffordable, open market price.  It is the same with the St. Kevin's HSE site in Cork.  If the Minister wants to know how we would dramatically increase the delivery of genuinely affordable homes, we should stop using public land to deliver unaffordable, open market price homes.  As the Minister knows, tonight there will be a special meeting of Fingal County Council to deal with the lands in Donabate for 1,200 much-needed homes.  The proposition from the local authority, essentially under instruction from the Department, is that 60% of those homes, almost 800, will be sold at open market prices.  The open market prices, according to the local authority, range from &euro;340,000 to &euro;450,000.  Why anybody would allow homes at that price to be built and sold on public land when we could ensure every home there was affordable to the electorate that elected the Minister and other Deputies makes very little sense.<\/p> <p>  The other big issue is that we were originally told that the LDA was going to deliver 7,500 homes per year and that it would deliver 150,000 social, affordable and private homes over 20 years.  However, according to the agency, and it gave this committee its pipeline figures a number of months ago, by 2025 when this Government is coming to the end of its term of office, if it gets that far, only a couple of thousand homes will be delivered by it and a portion of those will be unaffordable private houses.<\/p> <p>  There is one final matter, and it is important that the Minister clarifies this.  My understanding is that the Department's four-stage approval, tendering and procurement process will not apply to the LDA in the same way as it would apply to the local authority because there will be a designated activities company or subsidiary.  My point was not that the public spending code does not apply, but that it does not apply in the same way.  Therefore, local authority officials will say that, from their point of view, if there is an advantage to transferring the delivery of a project to the LDA, it is that it dramatically reduces the bureaucracy and staff time for them.  If that is the case, and I believe it is, why not just reform that process, remove the bureaucracy from the local authorities and give them the funding to deliver?  They are much better placed to deliver these projects if only they were assisted to do so.  On that basis, I am only more convinced of the legitimacy of the amendments I have proposed, having heard the Minister's replies.  I will press the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#F00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I will address the specific block of amendments first.  To be clear, the LDA will have to be fully compliant with public procurement and the public spending code.  The four-stage approval process is a different matter.  I have altered the four-stage approval process for local authorities, as the Deputy knows.  The single stage can be used up to &euro;6 million, and I will seek to review that further in respect of the housing for all plan.  That has been done in a short time.  It is telling that every housing development mentioned by the Deputy was opposed by his party.  It is remarkable that it always seems to find some reason to oppose the delivery of homes.  The specific proposal he mentioned will deliver 238 affordable purchase homes and 238 social homes, which is a significant amount.  There are private homes in addition to that.  It will be a big decision for any party to oppose the delivery of such a significant amount of affordable and social homes, but that is a position people are entitled to take and it is for them to explain it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 84, 96 and 98 to 101, inclusive, tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould, amendment No. 84 seeks to amend section 13(1)(c), which deals with the LDA providing assistance to local authorities in the development of large-scale local authority owned sites for housing.  The amendment seeks to delete the word \"develop\".  It is appropriate that the LDA would develop, or seek to develop, large-scale local authority sites.  However, to be clear about what is happening, the absolute predominance of delivery of social homes will be through the local authorities.  That is why they are being tooled and given the funding to do that, with the largest housing budget in the history of the State in budget 2021.  The LDA is doing this in Shanganagh, which we have discussed.  It is working in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to provide 600 social and affordable units.  <\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about the number of homes the LDA will deliver by 2025, we will see how many that will be, and I expect the agency to be ambitious.  However, we can be certain of one thing.  If Deputy &Oacute; Broin and his colleagues had their way with the amendments they wish to make to the Bill, the agency would deliver no homes.  They want to restrict the agency and say it should not build.  In some cases the LDA may develop a site on behalf of a local authority and, in others, it may work with the local authority to facilitate the development of the site.<\/p><p>Both provisions are necessary and are absolutely appropriate.  Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment as it would undermine the role of the LDA in assisting local authorities.  <\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 96, 98, 99, 100 and 101 seek to amend section 14 which sets out the detail as to how the LDA will provide services to local authorities.  Amendment No. 96 seeks to limit the services that the LDA will provide to \"land and land related\" while amendments Nos. 98 to 101, inclusive, seek to limit the role of the LDA to providing assistance to local authorities in the preparation of master plans, applying for development consents, providing housing and managing cost rental housing.  It is wholly appropriate that the LDA would provide these services to local authorities and not just assist them in that.  We must be realistic about where we are right now in terms of the delivery of homes for our people.  We need change in the housing area and this Bill represents change.  If we keep doing the same thing, we will have the same results.  We need to tool up these agencies to do the job and it is wholly appropriate to give them these powers.  <\/p><p> One of the purposes of the Bill is that the LDA would provide services to local authorities and support them in their role as housing authorities.  Local authorities will be able to avail of the centre of excellence which we want to see developed in the LDA for the delivery of housing in urban areas which is something that we really need.  Most people will see that there are different levels of expertise in different local authorities.  We need to build that expertise up and ensure that we have an agency in place that can assist.  Therefore, I cannot accept these amendments as they would undermine the role of the LDA in delivering services to local authorities.

Deputies are engaging in political posturing instead of looking at this national legislation as a real opportunity to deliver the affordable homes that we all so desperately want.  The LDA is a key part of the Government's solution to the housing crisis and that is a fact.  The Bill before us is key and this is an opportunity for colleagues in opposition to shape the legislation instead of just opposing it at every turn.  Indeed, they have already shaped it to some degree because there are lots of left-leaning elements in there already, including the taking back of power from developers and the utilisation of land that has been effectively frozen by stagnation.

In order to do so it must have the powers to appraise sites, prepare planning applications and obtain development consents.  Were this amendment to be passed, it would set back this land management agency for years to come.  We would be stripping it of such significant powers and denying it a role in the development of housing.  It is wholly appropriate that the LDA would be a development agency in relation to sites that are relevant public lands or land owned by it.  Designating the LDA as a development agency will permit it to develop planning schemes and enter into agreements with parties to develop strategic development zones, SDZs, on relevant public lands and lands in its ownership.  I want to be really clear that it does not confer any planning consent role on the LDA.  I would point out the role of the LDA as a development agency is limited to these circumstances and it will not have the full range of development agency powers that are assigned to a local authority.

The reason for this is very simple.  There is a notion, which has been peddled for a very long time, that if we just increase the supply of housing, the prices will become affordable.  This is an ideological notion, to use a term that Deputy Higgins used earlier on.  It is not based on reality whatsoever.  The clearest example that increasing supply does not lead to reductions in price or produce affordable housing is the Celtic tiger.<\/p><p>During the Celtic tiger we had housing supply at unprecedented levels, with some 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year being built during that period.  Did prices go down?  Not at all.  They went up because the housing was not being built to provide public, affordable or social housing but to make profit.  Those who were looking to make profit completely controlled the housing sector and during that same period when we had unprecedented levels of supply in the general sense, albeit profit-driven supply, we also had pretty much the turning off of the tap of direct build social housing on public land, starting with Fianna F&aacute;il and then carrying on through with Fine Gael Governments.  It is not an ideological point.  It is a statement of fact that increasing supply, no matter how great that supply is - and we had the greatest supply in the history of the State during the Celtic tiger - did zero to deliver public, social and affordable housing.  It did exactly the opposite and then it crashed the entire economy.<\/p><p> The whole point about the utilisation of the public land bank is that developing not-for-profit housing to deliver public and affordable housing is the only way to keep prices down, not only to deliver public and affordable housing on public land but also to dampen the entire market.  That is the purpose of these amendments.  It is to ensure that we do not repeat the disastrous mistakes that have been made in the private housing sector over recent years on the public land bank and to make sure the public land bank is used for what it should be used for.  It should be used to serve the interests of the public, specifically those who are on the housing waiting lists or those who cannot even get on those waiting lists because their incomes are higher than the social housing thresholds but whose incomes would not allow them to buy at the grossly inflated house prices that are available in the private market or rent at the grossly inflated rents that exist out there in the private market.  The sole purpose and usage of the public land bank should be to do that.<\/p><p> The other important point to make is that we want affordable housing.  Insofar as we have affordable purchase housing, we want it to be affordable in perpetuity so that no part of the public land bank will ever be marketised.  Even if people have the right to purchase affordable housing on the public land bank, it should be the case that they would have to sell it back to the local authority and that the profit would not be made from affordable purchase housing that was delivered on public land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#J00600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Oacute; Broin wish to speak on amendment No. 2 and the related amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#K00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I would like to fully support amendment No. 2 and to speak to my amendment No. 3, which is broadly trying to do the same thing.  This is an important and key element of the Bill and it is where the Opposition is united in trying to ensure that the maximum number of affordable homes are delivered on any site that is being developed by the Land Development Agency.<\/p> <p>  In his response to me when we were discussing the last group of amendments, the Minister made the claim that Opposition parties, including my own, are opposing housing developments across the city of Dublin.  The Minister knows that is not true.  We have not opposed a single housing development in planning for housing, particularly social and affordable housing.  I can only think of one major housing development that was opposed in a vote in a local authority in Dublin recently and that is Clonburris in my constituency where 8,000 to 11,000 homes were proposed with 2,500 social and affordable homes.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael groups not only voted against that development but when Deputy Higgins was the Fine Gael group leader on the council at the time she appealed it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, delaying it by almost a year.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander I suppose.<\/p> <p>  What we are saying here is that public land should not be used for unaffordable open market priced homes.  Therefore, what the Opposition has done in a number of local authorities - and we stand over this - is that we have opposed the transfer of land to private developers.  In many cases that land was below market value or for free, where large volumes of the homes on that land will be delivered at prices of &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000.  That is what these amendments are about.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned Donabate and asked why anybody would vote against that land transfer.  No market valuation has been made of the land there.  It will go to the developer, if the vote is approved tonight, for about half the market value and 60%, or almost 800 of the homes, will be sold at average prices of &euro;400,000.  I do not know how anybody could stand over such an inappropriate use of public land.<\/p> <p>  What my amendment does is straightforward.  Notwithstanding my fundamental opposition to the LDA as a residential developer, if it is to be a residential developer then it should not be building anything other than affordable purchase, affordable rental and social homes.  It is interesting, for example, that the councillors on Dublin City Council proposed an alternative and fully public development on Oscar Traynor Road.  As I said, Fine Gael councillors abstained on that because somehow they do not support the idea of all homes on that site being affordable.  It would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether he intends to support the request from the majority of Dublin City Council councillors to fund that development to allow it to be developed speedily so that every single one of the 800 plus homes on Oscar Traynor Road will be genuinely affordable to purchase or rent, as well as 30% of the homes there being social houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#K00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>As Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett have stated, the reason for these amendments is our concern that public land is being siphoned off to the private sector.  We want to deliver truly affordable homes for people.  I am dealing with a large amount of people every week who do not qualify for the social housing list and who cannot get a mortgage.  These people are trapped in the middle with high rents and being unable to save.  They need affordable homes.  Those homes should be delivered by local authorities.  If the LDA Bill goes ahead and if we cannot stop it, then we want it to be truly focused on people who need affordability, either in cost rental or affordable purchase.  That is why we want to change the Bill and that is why these amendments have been put forward.<\/p> <p>  To give the Minister and the Government parties some insight, in my maiden speech in Cork City Council in 2009, I outlined the housing crisis.  At that meeting, I was attacked by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors for grandstanding and for trying to create hysteria when there was no housing crisis.  The difference between Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties in the Opposition and the Government parties is that we knew there was a housing crisis because we were talking to people on the ground.  Now we have the Government 12 years later, saying it wants to tackle the housing crisis and saying that the Opposition is not engaging in the process to deliver truly affordable homes.

Section 2(a) of the Bill, as published, states that the purpose of the Bill is, \"to enable urgent measures to be taken to increase the supply of housing in the State and in particular affordable and social housing\".  That is pretty clear on what we want to do.  The amendment from Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues seeks,  to insert \"public and affordable\".  That is in the Bill already.  The same goes for the amendment from Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould.<\/p><p>I do not want to get into a back and forth discussion with colleagues about how they believe they are not delaying, objecting to or stymying housing developments at council level.  The people know what the situation is in that regard.  The purpose of this legislation is to progress matters and get the State delivering and building.  It is remarkable that Deputy &Oacute; Broin has again said that he is fundamentally opposed to the LDA, which is a State company, building homes.  One would have believed that, for someone who purports to want to deliver 20,000 public homes per year but will not say where, by whom and how, a State land development agency that delivers social, affordable and cost rental homes at scale would be viewed as necessary.  That is what we need to do.  I will remind colleagues that the State is the largest builder and part of the housing market.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that this is not just about supply, but the right supply.  That is why the Affordable Housing Bill passed Second Stage in the Seanad last night.  It is the most significant affordable housing legislation ever introduced and will deal with affordable purchases through shared equity on State-owned lands, provide cost rental at scale through the first national cost rental scheme in the history of the State, and introduce provisions expanding Part V to protect the 10% of social housing in private developments while adding a further 10% affordable housing.  These are mechanisms that deliver the right type of supply.  The State is intervening.  The Deputy regularly talks about the State having a role to play in housing, and he is right.  Here is an opportunity to support the State's involvement through a State agency building housing.  It seems that, in every instance, members of the Opposition will seek to oppose, not what we are trying to do, but what we are going to do to help delivery this year through the Affordable Housing Bill and this Bill.  We need to get on with that.<\/p><p> I oppose these amendments because there are already clear references - I have cited an example - to affordable and social housing in this section, as there are in multiple sections.

On the council, Sinn F&eacute;in voted against Kilcarbery with its 975 homes.  The Minister and I visited the site last week.  It was great to see progress being made there, builders on site and homes being delivered despite how Sinn F&eacute;in stood on the issue.  Lindisfarne and its 19 homes arose earlier this year.

A number of Opposition Deputies and Senators have misunderstood what the Bill is about, that is, taking public lands with a market value and permanently devaluing them so that the land cost can be eliminated from providing homes, effectively giving those lands a nominal value regardless of who owns them.  It ensures that, as homes are built on these lands in accordance with the Bill and other mechanisms, the land cost will not contribute to the cost of those homes.

I have combed through it and the amendments and I cannot see where they allow the State to give large tracts of public land to a private developer to make a profit.  If anything, the Bill attaches a permanent devaluation mechanism that ensures that, as the Minister said, the land value in places such as Dublin will effectively be nominal because of the cost of building.

I put up a hand, but it does not matter.<\/p> <p>  I need to set the record straight.  I presume that Deputy McAuliffe, who is referring to the Bill, has read it.  The Bill very clearly refers to the setting of affordable prices and rents and relating them to discounts on local market conditions.  It refers to the establishment of DACs for the different parcels of land that will be developed.  It also refers to commercial activity.  Without a shadow of a doubt, all of these elements marketise the land.  Why would one relate affordability to local market conditions?  They are not even average market conditions.  If we averaged out rents and prices across the places in the country with high rents and house prices and those parts with low rents and prices, we would get a bad enough figure for affordability, but the Bill refers to local market conditions.  In all of the areas where the affordability and housing crises are at their most intense, this would be a disastrous benchmark against which to set affordability.  Average rents in my area are anywhere between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000.  Average house prices are between &euro;500,000 and &euro;600,000.  Benchmarking affordability against local market conditions means that, even if there was a 20% discount, a price would be unaffordable for the vast majority of people.<\/p><p>Affordability has to be benchmarked against income.  A teacher's pay is no different in D&uacute;n Laoghaoire than in Leitrim.  The pay of a nurse, a council worker or a bus worker is not different because he or she happens to live in a different part of the country.  Affordability has to be benchmarked against people's actual income but this Bill opens up the public land bank to develop housing that is linked to market conditions, private finance and to commercial imperatives around designated activity companies.  We are not scaremongering when we say that this is the marketisation of the public land bank and an opening of the door to the privatisation of that landbank; it is there, in the Bill.  Our amendments, which all work in conjunction with each other, aim to protect the public land bank against marketisation and to ensure that it is used solely to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing, with affordability benchmarked against people's income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#L00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I appreciate the bona fides of Deputy Boyd Barret's contribution but I wish to clarify what I just said because the Deputy is conflating the term \"affordability\" in two different Bills.  Affordability is set out in the Affordable Housing Bill to allow councils to build homes on public land and the LDA will do the same.  That is dealt with in the Affordable Housing Bill.  In this Bill, the affordability percentage is a mechanism which is being used to devalue land that has a commercial or market value.  The land currently has a market value and we are applying an affordability percentage to that land and as a result, because it is below the market value and the costs of construction are there, the land effectively has no tradeable, real market value on the open market.  Therefore, we are eliminating the land costs and that is what the Bill is doing.  It is not a neat or pretty way of doing it but because we want it to develop and because we want to comply with EU state aid rules, we are doing that so that the land cost is eliminated from the overall cost when the LDA or the councils take up the obligation to build affordable housing.  What we are doing here is making sure that the land cost is eliminated.  That is done by applying the affordability percentage.  The land already has a market value and therefore, when we refer to market value in the Bill, we are naming its existing value.  It is clear that when we talk about market value, we are naming the current value of the land; it has a value.  When we talk about affordability, we are talking about a mechanism to reduce the land costs because we do not want the land to be traded openly on the open market, regardless of who owns it.  The mechanism will eliminate the cost of land in the development of housing by the LDA, the councils and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#M00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I now invite the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#M00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin has his l&aacute;mh suas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#M00400","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>My apologies.

It may be helpful for Deputy McAuliffe if we deal with the issues he raises at the relevant section of the Bill because many of us would like to contribute to that discussion.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak on amendments Nos. 41 and 213 now.  One of the big concerns I have with the section of the Bill dealt with in amendment No.41 is that it is giving the LDA the power to develop master plans and designs.  The LDA is not equipped to do that and has great difficulty in employing staff to do that job.  It also has no democratically accountable mechanism for approving that.  Local authorities are best placed, through their planning departments and their elected members, to develop plans for sites.  We see that, for example, in SDZs and Local Area Plans, LAPs.  There is some discussion among planning professionals about the innovative idea of local development zones, of which I am very much in favour.  Why we would give a State agency that has no knowledge of the affairs in different local authorities, the housing markets and the local realities, a centralised power when it does not have any history of doing that and deny that to the agencies that the State has funded to provide those master plans over a long period of time is beyond me.  <\/p> <p>  There is a value in talking about some developments in local areas because it allows us to talk about this in real time.  One of the great values of Shanganagh was that the LDA did not master plan it.  The local authority did the master plan on foot of consultation with elected members and so on.  I see no set of reasons for the LDA being involved in master planning.  That is a function of our planning authorities.  They are equipped, skilled and have a track record in doing it which is why I am proposing that we remove that section.  <\/p> <p>  The remainder of my amendments in this section go back to the central point that if the LDA is to be a residential developer, it should only develop affordable homes, that is, homes for affordable purchase, affordable rental and social rental.  It should not be in the business of using very scarce and valuable public land to build homes that will sell for between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000 or in the case of the Dundrum central site, up to &euro;500,000.  That is not good housing policy and that is why those amendments are attempting to constrain the LDA, if it is residentially developing, to 100% affordable homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#M00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will respond quickly on those amendments.  I have already responded to two.  Amendments Nos. 41 to 43 are another example of stripping functions from the LDA, which is a State-owned agency to develop and manage our own lands.  It is clear from the short two hours of discussion we have had today that Sinn F&eacute;in does not want the LDA to build any homes or to plan to build any homes or any infrastructure.  If Sinn F&eacute;in had its way, we would be left with a skeleton and would have nothing of any relevance.  We need to get on with the job in hand.  I cannot accept these amendments tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould.<\/p> <p>  The section provides for the establishment of the LDA and ensures that in the performance of its functions, economies of scale and efficiencies are achieved through a single entity providing services such as preparation of master plans, design and project management.  This is in addition to local authorities but not instead of them.  Local authorities will still be delivering the vast bulk of social homes.  This is about all of the other lands that we have been talking about that are not being used and about allowing the agency to have the ability to plan for their use.  It would be incongruous, if not incredible, not to allow the agency to do that.  It does not make sense.  I am opposing these amendments because the LDA has been and will be tasked with providing services for the preparation of master plans, design and project management.  That is its mandate.  The LDA employs experienced staff with extensive skills to do those various tasks, to complement the work of the very experienced and exceptional staff in our local authorities.

All the witnesses are most welcome.<\/p><p> All witnesses are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If the statements are defamatory, therefore, in respect of an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely Leinster House or in the convention centre in Dublin.  Regrettably, I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any committee member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will, reluctantly, be asked to leave the meeting.  Any other Members who attempt to participate from outside the precincts will asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members who are participating via Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p><p> For the information of anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely, with committee members being in the precincts of Leinster House or the convention centre in Dublin.  Only I, as Chairman, and the staff essential to the running to the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances of Covid and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical issues arise.  I believe, however, that we are in good hands with Anthony here.<\/p><p> I now call on Mr. Pat Larkin, CEO of Ward Solutions, to make his opening statement.

I am the chief executive and co-founder of Ward Solutions, one of the largest indigenous, dedicated cybersecurity companies in Ireland.  We spend our time helping a wide range of commercial, public sector, government and other organisations from a wide variety of sectors on the island of Ireland to secure their people, data and systems from malicious and inadvertent threat.  Prior to this I had the privilege to serve my country as an officer of the Irish Defence Forces at home and overseas with the UN.<\/p> <p>  Since our foundation in 1999, Ward Solutions has witnessed a number of things that are relevant to the committee's purpose here today.  Ireland's citizens, organisations and society have transformed to a sophisticated and prosperous digital economy, with a very significant digital dependency.  Significant technology and born in the cloud sectors have emerged indigenously and through foreign direct investment to a point where Ireland now holds upwards of 30% of European cloud data in data centres located on the island.<\/p> <p>  The dramatic digital transformation of traditional bricks and mortar organisations, including government, led to a very high digital dependency based on accessing and servicing the markets via digital channels.  A lot of business and wealth now located in Ireland has digital roots and is, therefore, much more portable as distinct from less portable legacy business.  This portable business and wealth can easily relocate to countries that are in a position to appropriately secure it.<\/p> <p>  In the field of cybersecurity we have witnessed the emergence of cybersecurity on global, national and corporate risk registers, consistently as one of the top three risks, along with climate change and global pandemic, and the increasing occurrence of all three risks.  We have witnessed the relentless increase in the scale, sophistication, and effectiveness of attacks directed against individuals, organisations and the State from criminals, hacktivists and militia to a point where the financial scale of cyber crime at &euro;6 trillion annually has overtaken the global illicit narcotics trade.<\/p> <p>  Organisations are increasingly challenged to protect themselves from inadvertent or non-malicious cyber events that similarly threaten their survival or prosperity.  There is a global shortage of cybersecurity talent, estimated to be about 3.2 million professionals by 2022.  The cybersecurity market emerged as a massive opportunity for Irish companies, conservatively estimated to be worth $173 billion in 2020, and growing to $270 billion by 2026.  There is an emergence of a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We work with our clients through the full cybersecurity lifecycle of assess, protect, detect and respond.  There is one absolute observable trend that we and our industry generally notice.  Clients who invest and adopt a systemic approach to their cybersecurity posture, who work to move from an immature approach to a fully optimised approach, suffer from the same hostile environment but are typically breached less.  When breached, optimised clients respond quicker and better and thus suffer less impact and cost to their business.  Cyber-optimised organisations treat cybersecurity as a journey, not a destination.<\/p> <p>  Ireland now needs a fundamental acceleration of our approach to national cybersecurity.  We have a society worth defending and we need politically and societally to move towards a national defence mindset with our national cybersecurity as one of the key pillars of our defence.  We need to move to leading and developing national and global consensus, to collaboration on cyber law, norms, ethics and behaviour, and to the global enforcement of same.  We need a full-blooded, joined-up, coherent and committed strategy for our defence, encompassing all government, national security and intelligence, industry, academic and research resources, to out gun the cyber bad actors.  We need to adopt a ten-year goal of making Ireland the cybersecurity capital of Europe.  We can do this by developing a world-class cybersecurity ecosystem in Ireland so we have the resources in country to secure ourselves.  In doing so, Ireland also stands the possibility of benefiting from a rapidly growing cyber marketplace, estimated to be worth $270 billion by 2026.  We need to raise our game nationally from an immature to an optimised approach to cybersecurity, to protect our citizens, our government and our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Larkin.

The Colonial pipeline attack, which may have been in the news in Ireland, shook up a large portion of American society.  It really hits individuals where they live and is escalating prices for gas.  It has had a direct impact on the citizenry.  Over here we also have health services getting attacked.  We do not have a national health service but we have prescription and hospital concerns.  A hospital in San Diego is currently struggling with ransomware.  We had more than 200 attacks on hospital chains last year also.<\/p> <p>  I will talk a little about my background and my perspective.  I started the company five years ago with the chief information security officer of Schneider Electric.  His expertise was primarily in cyber and operational technology.  My expertise was in financial modelling.  I bulked out a software product that operationalises regulation standards, like the NIS directive.  From what I have seen on the inside, my concern across many sectors is in accordance with what I have just heard, which is that there is some variance with regard to maturity and work in depth with the energy industry, the finance industry and across almost every sector.  We see the increase in frequency of ransomware and the increase in ransoms, which is quite alarming.  Maturity levels vary greatly.  With the pipeline Colonial tech we are dealing with the learnings here in the US.  The Administration here came out immediately with an executive order that sought to address some of the gaps that remain.<\/p><p>We have a sprawling regulatory regime here so when I work with the energy industry it is under something we call NERC CIP, which is a legacy set of standards that relate to the grid.  The pipeline industry is under a voluntary set of standards, so there is real variance between practitioners and companies within the energy industry.  One can see the results quite clearly.  We do not see that the organisations under strictly voluntary standards do a great deal of adoption.  That is not the case for all of them, of course, but we have learned over here, with the threat of going from cyber to physical in the pipeline industry hack, that the government and the Department of Energy are now re-evaluating whether to actively police or regulate the pipelines.  It is always a question.  The question comes down to the fact that 85% of our public infrastructure is in private hands.  Private infrastructure companies tend to live quarter to quarter.  They do not always put into practice some of the standards that are quite clear.<\/p><p> When I was speaking on television last week, there was quite a gap in understanding about what one does with respect to cyber.  People tend to think it is extremely expensive because these are complicated systems.  Many things done in cyber that are practice and policy oriented and employment oriented are not overwhelmingly expensive.  Best practices are not always terribly expensive.  The pipeline attack looked like a remote desktop protocol, RDP, attack.  In an RDP attack, one can do two-factor authentication and do some other things with RDP that make it much harder for brute force attacks.  There is no way to know, however, if one does not have metrics.  We can talk about standards and best practices, but there must also be metrics.  When the network and information systems, NIS, directive came into play, there was a colloquium in Washington DC on metrics.  It was essentially taking the cybersecurity framework we operationalise in our software and driving metrics over it.  It was very controversial.  Many industries do not want metrics.  They do not want to be measured.  If one cannot measure it, one cannot improve it.<\/p><p> I will end by saying that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Reilly, you referred to metrics.

I am attending in an advisory capacity, as mentioned, to support with the recruitment of the extremely important new position of director of cyber security, DCS, with the National Cyber Security Centre.  It is worth mentioning that this role will be recognised nationally as chief information officer, which is relevant for what I will discuss next.  I have been invited here in my capacity as a professional and seasoned human resources director, bringing more than 15 years of expertise in recruitment, particularly for senior and executive roles spanning technology, high tech and blue-chip companies both in Ireland and internationally.<\/p> <p>  We all acknowledge that the role of director of cybersecurity must be on the executive level team and board where business decisions among the executive team will be discussed and agreed together when they are decided.  This is a new critical hire for the NCSC.  The seniority and accountability of this role cannot be understated.  The director of cybersecurity will be at the forefront of the centre to drive and influence right decisions on security, strategy, infrastructure, programmes, people, behaviours and so forth in developing a sustainable and scalable secure model.  The gravitas and accountability that come with this role define the calibre of candidate that we need.  This role demands the best-in-class hire.  We must provide every opportunity to the NCSC to hire the best, most qualified, proven candidate, and one who is capable of delivering on an international level.<\/p> <p>  If we are to hire for success, we must hire expertise in this field, most likely attracting from the public sector and, therefore the remuneration of this role must be competitive.  If we are to fill this role, we must apply the salary range and benchmarking of the private market sector.  We recognise that this is a time when the job market is extremely competitive.  We see a great deal of movement at senior level roles, particularly this year where there has been a huge lift in confidence in people moving.  With all this in mind, the benchmarking on current market data for this role of director of cybersecurity, or chief information officer, provides for a basic salary ranging between &euro;220,000 to &euro;290,000 per annum, plus benefits including bonus, long-term incentive plans and stock options combined with a benefits package ranging between &euro;150,00 to &euro;200,000 per annum.  It is worth mentioning, also, that we are seeing other varied and flexible benefits, for example, a one-time sign on bonus for executive hires ranging up to &euro;20,000<\/p> <p>.  Everything hinges on getting this hire right to ensure the sustainable and secure success of the National Cyber Security Centre.  We need to get the package right to ensure we hire the right calibre for this role.  Once we have the package defined, we must ensure the process is immediately defined and runs smoothly.  That will include branding the role, driving positive branding through social media, newspapers and other such channels, using our networks to reach out to and attract candidates of suitable calibre, ensuring the interview process is defined and clear from the outset to ensure that it runs smoothly and efficiently through a thoughtful process, bearing in mind that we are competing against a very fast external market in which candidates are hired and move quickly through processes.  I recommend that we meet this head-on to ensure we hire the best-in-class candidate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Bl&aacute;thnaid Carolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Carolan.

We aim to enhance the innovation, growth and competitiveness of the companies and organisations which are part of the cluster.  Today we have over 120 members nationwide, comprising 40 multinationals, 60 Irish SMEs and 12 of the leading academic institutes, with our partners in government including the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Our aim is to move forward Ireland's cybersecurity agenda and advocate for industry needs.  Now more than ever there is a need for a collaborative approach across industry, academia and Government to address Ireland's cybersecurity challenges.<br\/><br\/>Cybersecurity  is a rapidly growing industry internationally for which there are a number of opportunities and challenges.  It is estimated that cybersecurity spending will reach &euro;240 billion worldwide by 2023.  The annual global cost of cybercrime has exceeded &euro;1 trillion.  The number of unfilled cybersecurity<b><\/b>jobs is predicted to hit 3.2 million by 2022 and current unemployment levels are low.  There is increased global competition for talent and investment and there is increased cybercrime globally and in Ireland.  The economic impacts of cybercrime put our indigenous SME sector at risk and this has knock-on effects for our foreign direct investment, FDI, brand.  There are skill shortages globally and locally and there is low level collaborative security research and development between industry and academia.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has become a significant base of international technology and security companies.  Some six of the top ten software security companies are here.  There are over 40 multinationals with cybersecurity operations in Ireland and there are over 60 Irish cybersecurity companies and start-ups.  Over 6,000 people are working in our cybersecurity industry and 30,000 professionals have cybersecurity related skills.  We have a strong talent pool with a highly skilled and multilingual workforce.  We are a digital leader, attracting foreign direct investment and hosting much of Europe's data.  We have a dedicated workforce with talent development programmes.  Ireland is uniquely placed to benefit from increased global investment in cybersecurity.  It has an opportunity to position itself as a global leader for cybersecurity talent and innovation.<br\/><br\/>Cyber Ireland aims to facilitate the cybersecurity ecosystem to capitalise on this opportunity.  We have a strong focus on talent and skills to ensure a sustainable pipeline of cybersecurity talent.  Our Cyber Ireland skills report was published in February and its key findings clearly highlight the opportunity and challenges facing the industry.  Our finding tells us that: in Ireland, 62% of companies will hire in 2021; our cyber workforce is highly skilled; 48% of organisations have open or unfilled cybersecurity roles; 46% of cybersecurity teams are understaffed; 19% of cybersecurity teams require six months or more to fill a role; 42% of new hires are from outside of Ireland; and 27% of cybersecurity teams have difficulty in retaining female talent.<br\/><br\/>A sustained long-term strategy is needed to address these gaps and Cyber Ireland is focused on building a strong pipeline of talent from schools and universities to industry with our partners.  We have programmes in place that promote career opportunities in cyber to students through the cybersecurity academy for secondary schools and career talks in cyber summer camps that we have planned for June.  We welcome the skills initiatives that are focused on upskilling our existing workforce and attracting talent to cross train in cybersecurity.<br\/><br\/>We strongly believe we have an opportunity to be at the centre of a growing global cybersecurity market, support indigenous cybersecurity SMEs and start-ups, be a leader in cybersecurity policy and the response to ransomware, influence Europe's investment and prioritisation of cybersecurity, and create a national research and development centre along with the NCSC with a strong national security perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>If the witnesses have prepared statements they might provide them to the clerk so that we can distribute them among members.

I might ask Mr. Larkin and Mr. O'Reilly about their experience of working with companies and what the difference is between a mature and an immature organisation in terms of the mindset, the commitment, the governance structures or the regulatory structures that separate them?  What should the two or three priorities be for Government in ensuring that more companies and State bodies move from being immature organisations to mature organisations?  I ask Mr. Larkin to address that first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#D00400","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  There are a number of key principles that differ.  I would call it a defence mindset rather than a compliance mindset.  If one focuses on compliance one is just trying to achieve compliance but if one focuses on defence and protecting what is important to the organisation, then one is much more centred on the robustness and resilience of the organisation.  Board level involvement, top-down engagement from the top level of the organisation and a commitment to cyber resilience and cybersecurity are important to the business.  That involves communication upwards from stakeholders in the business to make the board aware of that and to be transparent with it on the exposure it faces, the maturity the organisation is at and the work programme it needs to undertake to achieve that resilience.  It is important to point out that it is a journey and not a destination.  There is no point at which an organisation is entirely resilient or mature.  It has to commit to the ongoing journey.<\/p> <p>  Back to the second speaker's point, organisations need to bring standards and measurement into play to assess matters.  There are standards so we do not need to reinvent the wheel.  There are standards like ISO\/IEC 27001, which is a well recognised standard.  It puts in place an information security management system and governance in an organisation.  It is objectively measured and assessed periodically by an auditor and then that builds a structure by which an organisation can then layer in the people, process and technology controls that make it mature and resilient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I would agree with what the first speaker said but I would add to it.  What I have seen across a lot of different sectors, including the defence sector in the United States for example, is that we have hundreds of thousands of companies that supply up the chain to the primary contractors.  Often when one goes into a defence industrial base company that is trying to baseline itself on a cyber standard, it might have two or three people, if that, who are responsible for this.  On top of the IT management work that they are already doing, they are having to report out on a standard.  Sometimes, if they have a little bit of a budget they will contract with a managed service provider or the like and that will put a process in place but I generally see that such a move might be a one-off and it does not then become a continuous practice.<\/p><p>There is a role for governments, even at the lowest levels.  Some of the best companies we have worked with on the smaller end have direct mandates from the top to spend a budget to baseline themselves and then some continuous improvement on the cyber standard.  The EU's NIS directive is in alliance with the cybersecurity framework, CFF, and ISO, the information security management framework and other control frameworks are informative references.  There are many good standards out there.<\/p><p> With larger companies, we get into big time governance issues.  In larger companies there are many different departments, including those deal with compliance, risk, information technology and operational technology.  They often talk to each other but when we get them on calls together, sometimes the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.  This is an issue.  They must also justify spend when it comes to fixing things.  They might have alarming gaps in a programme and have to take it upstairs but to take it upstairs, they must make a risk-based argument.<\/p><p> The governance structures are not always interested.  There has been much talk about cyber being central to governance in larger organisations but at times over here, to be frank, governance structures have been asleep at the wheel.  It takes events like this to shake them up and they do but then, sometimes, the hype cycle ends and they move on.  Education is a good element of what we are discussing and that also applies to governance structures as well.<\/p><p> There must be teeth behind this as well.  In larger sectors I see results if executive pay is sometimes tied to cyber.  My company has seen that.  It is a complicated challenge as there are resource-constrained companies on the smaller end.  Many of the ransomware hacks hit smaller organisations, which can be difficult, as it leads to a scramble.  They might not have had time or resources to back up things.  That is why they are such a juicy target for attackers.  In larger companies there are sprawl and antiquated practices.  Much cyber is still drawn on spreadsheets, which is a problem, as there must be central visibility for the practice of cyber inside a company.  Spreadsheets do not get the job done.  Many large service organisations deliver on the back of spreadsheets.  When Mr. George Wrenn and I founded our company, we created software that makes a central repository for the practice of cyber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly.

That creates much opportunity and brings some very critical roles to the country but it also creates competition within organisations operating here, both on a multinational and SME level.<\/p> <p>  The real opportunity or challenge is to create more awareness in the school systems and university sector to create graduates with the necessary skills to fill these roles.  There are also opportunities for cross-training of people who are working and may have an interest in cybersecurity to bolster the general need in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for an excellent question.  It is pertinent as we are seeing a very competitive market that has been going in this direction for quite a while.  I do not have direct experience of the NCSC but nonetheless in the nation and right across Europe we have seen much activity and movement in the area.  This is partly because of last year's pandemic, which we are still in the throes of, and we would normally see between 12,000 to 15,000 people moving to Ireland from other countries but that has not happened.  The market is that bit tighter as a result, which is certainly throwing up much more movement across companies.  It is becoming much more competitive and we are seeing many headquarters setting up in Dublin.  It is really competitive.<\/p> <p>  With regard to factors relating to retention, on a human resource element we are looking at hygiene and wellness factors and job satisfaction.  We are considering whether people are growing their skill sets and ensuring those skill sets and career opportunities are being made available.  That is really important to individuals.  There is also the question of pay and the additional benefits around it, which are important.  It is a combination of many elements of the employee experience and there is not just one piece.<\/p> <p>  It is important not to lose sight of accountability.

I thank all guests for their presentations, particularly our guest from the US.  I was trying to work out which part of the US he is in and I recognise it is probably well past his bedtime.  This is really helpful as the witnesses have identified that our IT infrastructure, particularly in the health service, is under attack.  To some extent we seem to know where we are going with but the concern we have as a committee is to understand how vulnerable we are in other institutions of the State and fundamental service providers, or even the wider public sector.  If my comments are incorrect, the witnesses might correct me but it seems larger private companies have taken this more seriously, perhaps investing more money than State institutions or semi-State organisations.  It is something we must look at.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Larkin is a contractor in the State.  Does he have any views on the state of readiness or protection that exists?  He has indicated he does some State work.  What is the level of protection of State institutions and Departments, where key data are stored?  How does it compare with the experience in the private sector?  This is not about being critical but rather to give us some understanding of the challenge we face.<\/p> <p>  Ms Carolan addressed a point that I raised with the committee previously relating to the concerns about the position of director of the NCSC.

In general terms, the commercial sector has a slightly different mandate from the public sector and it comes back to the aspect of mindset.  In most cases, there is a very clear imperative.  We were shouting into the wind five years ago when we were trying to educate boards about the importance of cybersecurity and the need to do something about it.  The frequency and degree of crime and the resulting cost to organisations has ensured that data awareness now definitely exists.  Boards are bringing in businesses like ours to do cybermaturity assessments and assess organisations' readiness because they are interested in protecting shareholder value.  Customers vote with their feet if there are breaches.  Therefore, apart from the direct cost of an incident like a ransomware attack, or something like that, the tail cost is far more significant.  The clean-up costs, regulatory fines and related loss of customer confidence and revenue are huge factors.  This has ensured that boards are now intimately aware of the risks of cyber infrastructure and they are giving a mandate to their organisation to protect their revenue and customers.  The mindset now is a defensive one, namely to protect the business and shareholder value.  A clear mandate is coming from many boards to do that, and, therefore, there is a matching resource commitment from the top and a budget to do that.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that mandate is probably less clear in the public sector and in the Government.  There is more of a compliance mindset.  The National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, is also a regulatory authority for the European Union's network and information security, NIS, directive.  While it is a good framework and a step in the right direction, we must return to the fact that these are critical State services, such as health, telecommunications and power etc..  First and foremost, we need to secure those services.  If we do not do that, then the State and its people will suffer and so too will prosperity, because foreign direct investment, FDI, companies will vote with their feet.  That portable wealth and capital which exists in Ireland will simply move abroad.  If we are below par in cybersecurity, such wealth will move.  I refer to the State adopting a mindset which regards cybersecurity as critical to societal progress and prosperity and the protection of those aspects and not some notional compliance in respect of the EU concerning GDPR or NIS.  Do not get me wrong, compliance is important.  However, if we approach this issue from a mindset which views it as critical to our prosperity, services, economy and people, then that is a different mindset.  It is a mindset which leads to carrying out risk assessments and maturity capability assessments to protect against threats and putting programmes in place to secure the cyber infrastructure.  That mindset may not be as obvious in the Government and public sector, but it needs to be.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Larkin for that contribution.

Turning to the queries, the why aspect is complex.  The simplest answer though is that data are valuable.  Hospitals are being hit over here as well.  I refer to reputational concern.  The last time I was over in Ireland was in 2017.  I met with the Minister who then had responsibility for communications, and he told me that he wanted Ireland to be the primary cybersecurity centre for all of the EU.  Therefore, I can understand reputational concerns in that context, but everyone is getting hit.  This is a global problem and these criminal actors are inside states which often do not police their activities.  These are criminal organisations, but they punch a clock.  Their members show up in the morning and work.  They are professionals and are criminals.  They are very disciplined at what they do and they know what they are after, and that is data.  Health data are very valuable, and the organisations concerned are inclined to negotiate if their data are stolen.  Such a theft exposes private information and those are valuable data, and there are now even double ransom strategies.<\/p> <p>  The criminal organisations are growing in capability and the aspects of why this is happening are also connected to the technical level.  There are software vulnerabilities, remote desktop protocol vulnerabilities and all manner of things that hackers can do.  Hackers can log on to a website to look for Internet protocol, IP, addresses and do any number of things to breach systems and they will continue to do that.  We have a national ransomware task force over here which produced recommendations.  Ireland's firm stance on non-payment of the ransom is very impressive.  I state that because many of the companies here that are compromised get into quick negotiations and often publicly say they are not going to pay the ransom, when they have already paid it.  Those are some of the elements explaining why this type of attack happens.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Would that involve state organisations in America paying ransoms?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#F00700","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Yes.

Taking up the general point made by the previous speaker, however, healthcare is attractive because the data is valuable.  In addition, both private and public systems are incredibly complex.  They have what are called a large attack surface area because of the complexity of the environment, the spread of the network and the range of different users of the system, including doctors, nurses, students and vendors as well.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, it is an incredibly complex environment, which means that it is relatively easy to target from an attack perspective.  Even robust health systems, because of that complexity, are also vulnerable.  Equally, there is the ability to monetise the situation.  I agree with the previous speaker in this regard as well, in that I think that it is the principled and correct decision to not pay a ransom.  The reality, however, is that more than 56% of organisations pay a ransom.  It is usually because they have no choice, but it could also be because organisations may not have the same resources that enable a state to go through a complex, lengthy and costly rebuild of its systems.  Most organisations, and especially those which are private, are therefore faced with a simple balance-sheet choice.<\/p><p>Do we spend tens of millions of euro rebuilding or do we spend &euro;1 million getting the keys to unlock the system and get back to core business?  It does not help to speculate, but I do not know that Ireland or Ireland's health system has been consciously targeted.  It is another health system that is vulnerable.  They have carried out a targeted attack that has been successful from their perspective.  It is very difficult for us, as a State.  The challenge is that today the health system could be attacked, tomorrow it could be the power grid, the day after that it could be the transportation grid.  <\/p><p> In respect of a national security mindset, we should be cognisant of the fact that traditionally, when we think about national security, we think about state actors carrying out targeted attacks from a foreign policy perspective to influence a government.  In this case we are also seeing criminals attacking from a financial crime perspective, with a similar attack profile and causing similar national damage as state actors, potentially.  The mindset must be that criminal cartels can in some respects cause as much consequential damage to a state as nation state actors carrying out deliberate foreign policy based attacks.  From a mindset perspective, it is necessary to take the position that, defensively, we must secure ourselves against the attacks of criminals almost as much as we need to be secure against nation state attacks, because either is of similar consequence and catastrophe to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>In his opening statement, Mr. Larkin stated that politically and socially, we need to move to a national defence mindset, with our national cybersecurity as one of the key pillars of our defence.

For example, Ireland is a member of the UN Security Council.  If we set out our policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or another issue on which are entitled to set out our policy, it is possible that perhaps not even a nation state but a militia group within a nation state, may object to that and inflict collateral damage on national security by simply objecting to it.  It is about recognising that reality and making the philosophical mindset shift towards the idea that we need to protect our national State, resources and sovereignty and then investing accordingly.  <\/p> <p>  The biggest issue is the shift in the societal and political mindset towards the idea that national security is important and we have something worth protecting.  Everything else flows from there.  We have a national risk assessment which is updated regularly.  We must look at that, because the risks were set out on that assessment.  We need commitment from Government.  It requires a whole-of-society commitment that is made collaboratively.  Government, industry and citizenry need to do their bit.  Once that mindset has been adopted and it is recognised that we must secure ourselves nationally, we need collaboration and alliances.  If an attacker is projecting themselves from a nation state in eastern Europe, Asia or wherever it is, we will not solve that problem from Ireland.  We will solve it through alliances with international governments, UN member states and international law enforcement, policing and intelligence.  We need to try to build that consensus.<\/p> <p>  We have an awful street credibility now because we are suffering a catastrophic attack on our national health system.  Looking at other countries that have suffered attacks, Estonia, for example, suffered a similar catastrophic attack against a wider set of its critical services in 2007.  It came back from it stronger.  It took the attack as a wake-up call.  Now, it is one of the leading actors in the area of international law on cybersecurity.  It built alliances, albeit typically with NATO member states, around protection.  In respect of resilience, it has developed a clear strategy around delivering digital government to ensure that it is secure in the face of an attack by a nation state or criminals..<\/p> <p>  We should heed the wake-up call.  We must make the shift in the mindset towards the need to ensure security and to do it right.  We must adopt a very coherent and well-resourced strategy to deliver it and we must stick at it.  We cannot just let this moment pass and move on with business as usual once the health system has recovered.  We need to heed the wake-up call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Currently there is an annual budget of &euro;5 million going into the national cybersecurity centre.

I have built very strong partnerships with Ireland's top headhunters and business consultants, who run salary benchmarking and benefit data every year right across Ireland and at an international level, as needed.  It is about keeping on top of what the market is telling us in terms of where we need to be at to draw the calibre of candidate to the roles that we are seeking to fill.

The role really requires a highly-qualified expert who can come in with the gravitas that is required to support the National Cyber Security Centre and to bring the accountability that is needed.

I agree with what has been said.  We have fairly conclusive proof, to the narrative that is out there, that we have insufficient capacity to deal with the situation we are in.  Will Mr. O'Reilly and Mr. Larkin put it starkly what exactly we are facing in terms of ransomware?  I am talking about the number of attacks and the number of criminals we believe are operating in this situation.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Reilly spoke about the Colonial Pipeline situation.  The big fear beyond even what has happened is the cyber to physical attack and us being wide open.  As brutal and heinous as the attack on the HSE was and, similarly, the Colonial Pipeline attack, they were both high profile and some of these gangs may have bitten off more than they can chew.  We all know there is a certain narrative that some of them might even be, as it were, semi-state operators, so there would be communications between states and these criminals, and maybe they have been told to rein themselves in.  The fact is there is a threat and it needs to be dealt with.  What exactly needs to be done regarding the threat facing us?<\/p> <p>  I would also like if Mr. Larkin could give a bit more information on the risk assessments.  My fear is the NCSC, when it has a concentration on compliance, does not have the capacity to carry out that compliance and risk assessment, and then enforcement related to risk assessment is carried out on organisations that are of critical importance to this State.  It is what we need from a point of view of protecting this State, as Mr. Larkin said, and then I have even heard a narrative in the past while that as we build that sort of capacity, we also need there to be an element of offensive capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#H00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked very good questions and I understand his concerns.  Over 2020, the incidence of ransomware attacks increased by 311% and upwards of 350 million was paid out in ransoms, and that is just the disclosed stuff.  The gangs are going nowhere and ransomware continues to be developed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of semi-state actors, when I was on television I was repeatedly asked, in terms of the states they are acting out of, who is responsible for this.  It is something as a private citizen I am a little careful about but I think we all know they may be semi-state operators and, in that case, that means there is more will behind it.  When it gets to cyber to physical, you would want to be very careful about the political terms you speak in, obviously.  Cyber to physical keeps cyber professionals up at night.  There was a lot of great research around it done in 2010 and they were looking at attacks that propagate over the generator systems and the like.  Then, 2015 happened when we actually saw a grid go down in Ukraine.  Those types of attacks are truly scary because they hit the national infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  In the States, we have a unique situation that 85% of our public infrastructure is in private hands.  This is a very difficult situation to be in, largely because it is hard to impel some of those holders of that infrastructure to do the right things.  We have some regulations in place to force that but we are struggling and scrambling at the moment.  The Government has said all the right things after the Colonial Pipeline attack.  We are now evaluating whether pipeline security should be the responsibility of the Department of Transportation, and we have six individuals in oversight there, so there is an analogue to some of what Ireland might be dealing with at the NCSC.<\/p> <p>  My company makes software.  We benchmark organisations on cyber.  We work across a large set of organisations.  My perspective is we need standards.  Compliance is important but it is just one aspect of the overall approach to cyber.  I love the term \"risk assessment\" because it is the way forward.  You have to identify and prioritise, and risk assessments do that.  They also take probabilities into account.  That is why information sharing is so important here in the States because we have to have better ideas of what the probabilities are.  C-suites and boards will not invest if they cannot financialise the actual risk, but to financialise risk you have to have good data.  These are important things to understand in the practice of cyber.  Risk has to be understood.  Compliance and risk are related.  Talking about it more is getting the private and public partnerships going that will help to solve this long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>At an operational level in an Irish context, we have a security operations centre.  Three years ago, ransomware for our clients, either the clients we have or inbound clients, would typically have been a once a week or once a fortnight event.  It is now a daily event, so we are dealing with ransomware incidents and outbreaks daily.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the previous speaker's point, it matches exactly with the profile of increase.  Why?  Because it is so easy to execute and it is so lucrative.  It is industrialised now from a cybercriminal's perspective.  There is a whole cybercriminal ecosystem.  When we talk about one group perpetrating this attack, actually it is not one group.  It is a whole layer of contractors and subcontractors who provide different ranges of services in perpetrating the attack and then liberating and washing the finances associated with it.<\/p> <p>  It is absolutely the case that, at an individual organisational level and at a national level, we all have to improve our cyberhygiene and beat the odds.  It is like the physical security in your home.  If you put a burglar alarm in, if you put gates and locks in, then typically the criminal passes by because it is more difficult to break into your house than your neighbour's.  Unfortunately, you are trying to secure yourself so that you are at the smaller end of the probability scale.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the previous speaker's point: it is all about risk and mitigating risk.  You can spend an infinite amount of money, resources and time delivering security and security technology, but the majority of it is inefficient if you are not deploying it against identified risk and mitigating that risk.<\/p> <p>  It comes back then to the broader agenda, where we need to lead as well, which is we have to change the game here.  Internationally, you have to make the organisations perpetrating this type of activity pariahs.  You have to make any nation states that are facilitating it or are ambivalent towards it pariahs and there have to be sanctions.  You have to enforce it.  At the moment at the UN there are still debates on whether cyber law is adequate and how we are going to deploy it and enforce it.  Because this is a global problem, however, while we can secure our critical services, our organisations etc., infinite defence in its own right is not a strategy.  The principle of defence, from my military days, is you defend and protect yourself long enough that you can launch a counter-attack.  That is the argument for defence.  If you are not in a position to launch a counterstrike against the people perpetrating this, then at some point they are going to get in.  You can defend repeatedly but at some point they are going to get in, so we need a global consensus to say this activity is a higher order of crime, particularly when it attacks critical national infrastructure or health systems.  It is not a financial crime; this is a higher order of crime.<\/p> <p>  Without being dramatic about it, there are adverse patient outcomes to what has happened in the health system leading to increased mortality.  This is not a financial crime.  This is a crime against society and a crime against people.  You have to look at it as that higher order of crime and we have to mobilise the United Nations and people like that to say this is unacceptable, the people perpetrating this are pariahs, and we have to go after them, their assets and their infrastructure like they were narcoterrorists or international criminals.  We also have to go after states that are ambivalent or are facilitating or perpetrating this as international pariahs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I very much appreciate that.

It helps to attract people into the industry and makes students more aware of protecting themselves from online security risks.

This rewarding and challenging area offers young people tremendous opportunities to have fulfilling careers.  We should create more graduates with cybersecurity expertise, more masters programmes and more research and development.  There are some top-class research teams in the country, both in industry and academia.  We should try to connect these organisations to focus on research projects that create more security for companies, organisations and the State.  The situation is not going to change quickly but we must put a focused effort on making it more attractive.

Estonia, as the Senator pointed out, had a compelling event and responded appropriately, as he has outlined.  Estonia has become a recognised centre of excellence.  It has adopted the strategy that it must survive particularly malevolent state action, and maintain society and the delivery of digital government in the event of a significant attack or influence.  Estonia is a base model.<\/p> <p>  The UK has probably come back to its national cybersecurity strategy two or three times but has made considerable progress this time around.  The cyber tsar it has put in is a recognisable individual, Mr. Ciaran Martin, who has added an awful lot of coherence.  He has added coherence in overall policy.  The UK has engaged in things such as active cyber defence whereby not only is it sitting in defence but it is targeting and taking down malicious domains and sites within its organisation in order to improve the cyber hygiene of government across the board.  The UK offers services that various public bodies would use, etc., and provides a significant level of investment.  There are lessons to be learned from how the UK has approached this matter the second or third time around.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate there may be reservations about other aspects of its society but Israel has done well from a cyber perspective and we should look at that.  Israel has imperatives around foreign policy and national security and it has, therefore, delivered a collaborative approach between the military and society.  I accept it is a militarised society and there is, therefore, an acceptance that cyber is an important pillar.  From a government perspective, Israel has led initiatives such as thinking outside the cyber box, etc.  There have been huge levels of innovation.<\/p><p>I was part of a buying mission when I was in the Defence Forces back in the late 1990s and I saw that level of collaboration between industry, users and military where literally some industry players had co-resident development ongoing with the military and the military was consuming their development of technology and then using that to export internationally.  In terms of a security imperative and a collaborative national approach, Israel is an example, appreciating all the other reservations about policy and everything else that is going on there.

We still have challenges in the States.  We spend quite a bit more on cyber, something like &euro;20 billion per year.  We have a lot of very good standards and organisations which generate such standards.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, does a fine job and the federal government does baseline itself regularly.  That said, many challenges remain.<\/p> <p>  With respect to best practices, the committee could certainly look at the executive order just released from the White House.  It is pretty comprehensive.  The emphasis is really on information-sharing, to some extent, and on changing the acquisition contracts around companies that do business with the federal government.  That emphasis is really around information-sharing as well.  One of the big problems in cyber in the States is visibility into true risk.  Frequently there are these informational problems; companies are not reporting what is happening to them as there is an incentive not to.  However, fresh air is the best disinfectant.  When I was asked about this issue recently, I basically said it is hard to do risk assessment if one does not have complete data sets.  I hope to see from our government more emphasis on actually generating quality data sets with respect to risk because that will help governance structures make the improvements they need to make.  I re-emphasise that the executive order is a real fount for best practice.  I revisit it every day.  Newspapers call me every day to talk about it.  Its first recommendation is an interesting one; it suggests organisations should ensure logging practices are being done properly.  There is a set of maybe ten things that can be done across the board, that are not prohibitively expensive, that can be measured, around which metrics can be put, and can get the critical infrastructure or the essential services sector on the right path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly.

What should it look like in Ireland?  I noted Mr. Larkin said the UK is spending ten times more per head of population on a similar system.  Therefore, what should it look like here?  What type of form should it take?  I noted Mr. O'Reilly said big wins have been made when there is collaboration between public and private and we can see in this attack that basically what is happening behind the scenes is that there is a collaboration between public and private to try to come up with a response to deal with this.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, there must be a very strong global response to cybersecurity because when all the different countries are doing their own things, these criminals are preying on countries and their weaknesses and we have been exposed in this.  It is desperate to see the fallout of these criminals preying on vulnerable sick people in our health system and to see the impact that is having on the ground is truly shocking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#K00500","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Will we let Mr. Larkin take the Deputy's question?

Very quickly, first and foremost, I suggest a very clear commitment from Government to say national security, cybersecurity is important and therefore we must move nationally from immature to optimised.  A very clear statement around that would be good.  There is a national risk register which I think is conducted by the Department of Defence.  Taking the risk-based approach is looking at the risk register and then building strategic, tactical and operational mitigation of that risk with a commitment to it.  While we are talking about budget and spend, it is wasted unless it is mapped and used in terms of strategically-planned risk mitigation approaches.  Therefore I recommend a commitment from the Executive to say national cybersecurity is important and that we are really going to focus on improving it.  That feeds down to co-ordination at a central level.  What we do not want is turf wars and silos within Government so somewhere, maybe under the National Cyber Security Committee, NCSC, or under the Taoiseach, it needs to be co-ordinated from a national security perspective, with the cybersecurity pillar underneath that to drive it.  One then uses resources like the NCSC to provide leadership and governance, particularly of critical national infrastructure services, and one uses the standards and frameworks that are there, namely, those of ENISA, the International Organization for Standardization, ISO, the NIST, etc.<\/p> <p>  The genesis of the collaboration piece has already been started.  Cyber Ireland, which I should declare I am a board member of, along with Mr. Walsh and Dr. Byrne, is perhaps the genesis of this.  I say so because it has an economic agenda, which is about creating the ecosystem of industry, academia, research and Government, so it is further support for that.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland are already supporting that and it will, in some respects, create the talent pool, industry imperatives, etc.  Out of the national security plan, all of that is key but then we must build indigenous capability.  It is then about bringing all the resources of the State and their tasking up to date, by which I mean mandating police to police cybercrime and State security, and mandating the Defence Forces to build capability.  On that, I know, just colloquially that in some respect the Defence Forces have been restrained and contained in terms of the cyber role.  There is an opportunity there for every soldier to be a cyber-soldier, for argument's sake, from an innovation perspective, because they have a training mandate and then they would bring huge national resources in aid to the civil power to all the rest of the authorities on a crisis basis.  Thus it is about innovation, about taking the imperative from the top down to say this is really important, we need to solve it, we need to improve it and then all the strategy and resources flowing from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Dr. Byrne wants to come in on that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#K00900","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  To respond to the Deputy's question and build on Mr. Larkin's previous point, there is an opportunity here to build on public-private partnership and we have started that already with Cyber Ireland, the national cybersecurity cluster organisation which is aiming to bring industry, academia and Government together to address specific challenges for industry but also for national security as well.  It developed out of addressing the talent and skills shortage and a lot of the challenges have been clearly identified there already so I will not go through them again.  It is also important to say there is a huge amount of work already being done in growing home-grown cybersecurity talent in Ireland.  We have programmes there supported by Government, which are training up 5,000 professionals in cybersecurity skills all across different areas of the economy.<\/p><p>Fourteen new courses in cybersecurity were funded by the Government last year in our higher education sector.  A cybersecurity apprenticeship programme is producing entry-level graduates for the sector, and just last year an &euro;8 million project was funded under the Higher Education Authority human capital initiative, which aims to produce hundreds of new cybersecurity graduates.  That is being led out of Munster Technological University and four other academic institutes.  Cyber Women Ireland is addressing gender diversity, while other groups are looking at career promotion for secondary school students.  We are involved in the cybersecurity academy and have summer camps for internships.  A lot is being done but there is a lot more we can do.  In the UK, for example, there is the CyberFirst programme for secondary school students and the US has cyber ranges, or virtual training facilities, to provide cybersecurity training and education to secondary school students, third level students and citizens.<\/p><p> Another key point is that one of the reasons for developing Cyber Ireland was the current low level of collaborative research and development between industry and academia.  This is a severe challenge because there is currently a fragmented approach to cybersecurity research in Ireland, whereby academic and research entities are trying to address these urgent national scale cybersecurity challenges through a disconnected or small-scale response.  We need to look at developing a national cybersecurity research centre to address this challenge.  There would be potential to develop cybersecurity research solutions that could have sectoral applications for areas in which Ireland is already a leader, such as manufacturing, processing, the biopharmaceutical sector, industry 4.0 and so on.

I thank the participants for sharing their expertise and insight.  Everything we have heard this morning highlights the magnitude and complexity of the problem.  When it comes to cybersecurity it is quite obvious at this stage that Ireland left the front door and the back door open.  We are now reacting to fix the damage.  The damage is done and I have no doubt that our complacency will cost us dearly.  Dr. Byrne spoke about what has been done in recent years.  The HSE is the biggest organisation in the country and handles billions of euro of taxpayers' money.  Why was it so complacent and so outdated?  Why were its defences so weak?  The reason it was attacked is that it was obvious it was vulnerable and open to an attack.  From a technical perspective, why were the Department of Health and the HSE so vulnerable?<\/p> <p>  What would be involved in putting in place a defence mechanism?  We have heard we should be spending in the region of &euro;50 million, but if we had the budget and the personnel to put the infrastructure in place, what timescale would be involved in bringing it up to an acceptable standard?<\/p> <p>  Data are valuable and very personal to every individual.  There is an opportunity here for a double ransom, that is, one ransom from the HSE or the service provider and another from the individual.  What has happened in the United States as regards GDPR and the duty of care of the provider?  Has that not left states and their agencies open not alone to ransom but also to legal actions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#L00400","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>GDPR has not quite taken the same foothold in the States as it has in the EU.  Jurisdictionally it is not something a lot of American companies would concern themselves with and certainly not as regards localised health concerns.  We have a very distributed healthcare delivery system so it is quite different from Ireland's institution at the moment.  Some states have been frustrated by federal inaction on privacy regulations and have put their own standards into place, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, CCPA, and other states have followed suit.  As a means of enforcement, fine delivering bodies have taken a bit of a hold here in the States but I do not know that I have seen the impact across the healthcare delivery system in the States as of yet.  We have a very distributed, privatised system.<\/p> <p>  The Colonial Pipeline attack is a unique case study in how having public infrastructure in private hands goes quarter to quarter in terms of investment. A longer term capex is required with respect to mandating standards and the like and tying the performance around measuring risks and standards to actual numbers and analytics in order that organisations can make decisions about how they go about remediating.  If there is no way to measure it and if companies are just doing one-off risk assessments yearly, the data will be a year old when they revisit the issue and do the analytics, and in some respects they will be useless.<\/p> <p>  Our private sector has done brilliant things in cyber.  Like Israel, for example, we have many tech start-ups that do incredible things such as endpoint detection.  I have a partner company and some of our investment group has invested in Virsec, which does ring-0 malware detection and looks at memory protocols, effectively killing around 100% of attacks.  There are brilliant solutions in the private space but there has just not been enough co-operation to date between the public and private sectors.  That company was founded around the cybersecurity framework, which was a consortium of 3,000 industry experts in co-operation with NIST.  It is initiatives like that that drive more and more co-operation between the private and public sectors.  The public sector is great at certain things and the private sector is great at certain other things.  That co-operation is needed to get the synergies and efficiencies going forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>What is the timescale?

Expectations should be set around that.  The cost associated with it is ongoing.<\/p> <p>  It is important to take the lessons learned here.  As part of any systemic review we should be focusing on the lessons learned and then building those in as improved controls and governance structures to try to prevent such things.  We should also be sharing that intelligence.  Some of these lessons would apply across healthcare but there are also lessons that would apply across the whole country and globally.  I have long advocated that we take an aviation approach to cybersecurity, which means disclosing, investigating, systemically taking the learnings, re-engineering them back into the impacted systems and standardising.  That is the approach I would advocate.<\/p> <p>  As regards building a strategy and defences, this must be looked at collectively and not in a manner specific to the HSE or any other organisation.

The lack of interest leads on to an ostrich-type smugness, which has led us to the dangerous situation that Ireland finds itself in today.  Security and defence are one and the same thing.

Does this mean that the base salary will have to be even higher than what she is suggesting?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Walsh and Dr. Byrne from Cyber Ireland.  On the development of cyber at junior certificate level, it has always been a regret of mine that Ruair&iacute; Quinn's programme was not embraced when he brought it forward to develop education, even though I was the president of the union that stopped it.  I believe that we need to develop this.  I am interested in what Dr. Byrne has to say about the apprenticeships, but I think we are going to find ourselves tight on time.<\/p> <p>  Some countries in Europe, particularly some of the Nordic countries, moved to open source software in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as far as I am aware.  If we had open source software that was bespoke for the purposes of each Department, would it be a safer type of platform, rather than purchasing what is commercially available?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I have some quick points.  I assume the National Cyber Security Centre would be probing organisations throughout the country all the time.  Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly and Mr. Larkin might want to come in on this.  Should there be sanctions against a company that fails, particularly against a semi-State or State organisation?  There are stories coming out of the HSE about computer monitors with passwords taped to the monitor, so that people can have quick access.  It is not just about sitting in an office on cybersecurity; I would think it is a pro-active move throughout an organisation.<\/p> <p>  I think Mr. Larkin mentioned foreign direct investment, FDI, risks.  Would he care to quantify the type of risk we are exposing ourselves to?  We have so many organisations here.<\/p> <p>  Finally, with respect to a cybersecurity centre, which Department should it be under?  Should it be under the Department of Defence or the Department of Justice?

In terms of the FDI risk, we need to be aware that as organisations look to locate in a country, they assess the good business environment, the access to talent and resource pools and then the security of their investment.  That is the kind of criteria that they use.<br\/><br\/>We brief boards regularly.  On the foot this event, I have had a number of requests for briefing, including from one large natural resources company.  The nature of the briefing is such that they are looking to assess whether this was, in our opinion, a nation state attack and what is the state of national cyber defence, etc.  I think that there is a heightened awareness.  I do not know that there is any imminent,<i>per se<\/i>, or immediate risk.  We have to look at it as a long game.  The long game is that we have to build strong, mature, optimised cybersecurity capability, to protect all the resources in the State.  If we do that, then we will continue to attract FDI and retain it.  That is why Cyber Ireland is so intrinsically important to this whole strategy.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the location of the NCSC, in some respects, it is as appropriate where it resides as anything else, provided that the national security governance and commitment is joined up.  That needs to come from centre of Government, somebody who can drive that strategy into all parts of Government organisation.<br\/><br\/>In terms of sanctions, blaming the victim is perhaps unhelpful here.  We do not blame homeowners when their houses are burgled.  We point to them where they could improve their security, etc.  Blaming the victim, in some respects, creates a perverse incentive for the ransomware attackers because, if we blame the victim, then there is an increased incentive not to disclose and pay.  I think we have got to move to a mindset of supporting and getting the victim to improve their security.  There will not be a healthcare professional working in the health system who will not be traumatised by what has happened, between Covid-19 and ransomware.  I think we will get goodwill.  A compelling event like what has happened - disastrous as it is &ndash; is quite often, if used positively, a good spur to drive improvement and to gain buy-in to improvement.

The Senator&rsquo;s question on a security awareness programme on a national level is an incredibly important point.  It is being used throughout Europe and internationally to raise awareness of cybersecurity.  I think it is important that we tell a story of the impact of cybersecurity on society and start a national conversation around cybersecurity.  That needs to be funded appropriately.  The NCSC has a national cybersecurity awareness programme that runs in October, in line with the European cybersecurity month, which is run by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA.<\/p> <p>  There is also a role for Ireland to play within Europe for cybersecurity.  Just this morning, there was a European Commission workshop on the establishment of the European cybersecurity competency centre, which is looking at supporting indigenous European small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, to develop, to innovate, to grow and to compete internationally, while also building Europe&rsquo;s cybersecurity posture and strategies.  There will be national cybersecurity co-ordination centres set up as part of this European competency centre, so Ireland would be setting up one of these.  That needs to be set up within six months of the European competency centre, which is being set up in Bucharest in the coming months.

I thought that was very alarming.  It gives some context to where everything is at.  This is a form of attack.  Our country has been under attack for the last week and a half.  It is a new form of warfare, where a country is laid siege to by another entity.  I want to ask a question that has not come up so far.  It concerns me that it is going to take us, as a nation, five to ten years to get to full capacity to fight back against cyberattacks.  In that time, things will have shifted hugely.  We may get to the finish point and yet find that the whole world has changed in that interim period.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that struck me was that this form of attack is, as I said, a form of warfare, but we are a neutral country, militarily.  However, when it comes to cyberattacks, this is a global problem.  I put the following question to the panel.  Do we really need to go so far to create our own competency to fight cybercrime, knowing that other countries spend far more than us and knowing that their systems are far more advanced than ours?

There is a need for collaboration and for not reinventing the wheel.  We need to have indigenous capability.  We may use tools, resources, etc., from collaborative alliances, allegiances or whatever one wants to term them.  We are not going to fight this on our own, but we need indigenous capability, first and foremost.  I do not think we could depend on others because alliances will change.  We need indigenous capability.  However, in order to be successful, we will have to partner and have alliances.  Those alliances may not necessarily compromise our neutrality.  It is collaboration that will happen between police forces, defence agencies, intelligence agencies, peer-to-peer, the National Cyber Security Centre, industry and academia.<\/p> <p>  In terms of staying current and the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the investment we are making, it is a very agile approach.  Something like the National Cyber Research Centre and the drawing together of the research and development strands is absolutely critical to leading and to staying current.

In every primary school, there is a vertical axis in the principal&rsquo;s office.  There is a computer that is networked all the way up to the Department.  It would hold a lot of sensitive data.  However, if one goes into all the classrooms, one could have a Windows 95 or Windows 97 laptop, which is linked back to the principal&rsquo;s office.  This would be typical of every school in Ireland.  There is a real chink in the armour there.  If one were to get into a teacher&rsquo;s laptop at any time, there would be everything from tests to assessment data.  There could also be very sensitive information.  That is just in education.  It is probably replicated in the small two or three garda Garda stations in rural Ireland or in the local health centre run by the HSE.  We probably have fairly robust systems in the central vertical axis of organisations, but it is far weaker as one moves out.   I would like to ask Mr. Larkin whether the chink in the armour is those outposts of State organisations and Government agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#N01200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I do not think so.  The chink is perhaps everywhere.  The Deputy is right that we need an approach that secures the citadel, the critical parts of the network and where the data resides.  Realistically, and without being alarmist, the reality is that in every part of infrastructure, power, utilities, etc., one will find laptops and operational technology, OT, devices that exist that are perhaps are not appropriately controlled or secured.  That relentless risk assessment and information security management is trying to identify those points on highly secure, highly critical networks as much as less-secure peripheral networks, to find those vulnerability points and those weaknesses and either secure or remove them.  Our experience would be that at the centre of some of the most sensitive and eye-rollingly scary environments, we will find the same weaknesses that the Deputy just outlined.  There will be relatively insecure or uncontrolled devices creeping onto those networks, producing a vulnerable point by which those networks can be compromised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":381,"content":"<p>When ransoms were paid, did the attacks stop?

If they are operating from environments where there is ambivalence towards them, perhaps they have broken a norm.  In general terms, if they were attacking a non-aligned, more neutral state, with whom perhaps the state in which they operate might not necessarily have an axe to grind, it may be that they are taking the heat off themselves.  It may be that they have made a decision to say that, for argument&rsquo;s sake, the extorted is not going to pay and, therefore, they still can monetise this by virtue of selling the records on the dark web.

The business reason, generally, may be expediency.  It may be that they transgressed a line.  Many of these ransomware providers make sure that their software does not attack the states in which they operate.  Quite specifically built into the engineering of the software is to look and see before they attack, just in case there is inadvertent deployment or collateral damage deployments, and that they do not attack the environments that are ambivalent to them or in which they operate because obviously that brings heat on them.<\/p><p>That is general speculation but I have no knowledge as to why they would have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#N02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Does giving the keys back change the game for the HSE in terms of securing data within its system?
