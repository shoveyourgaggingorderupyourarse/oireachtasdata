Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I will ask Members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to this constitutional requirement.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Those in attendance are asked to mute themselves when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback. They should also use the button to virtually raise their hands when they wish to contribute and take it down afterwards.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee will refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The D&aacute;il recently passed a motion to change Standing Orders to use a more gender-neutral term than Chairman.  The D&aacute;il has agreed that the word \"Cathaoirleach\" will be used instead.  On that basis, will Members address the Chair as \"A Chathaoirligh\"?  For the committee's information, the clerk will circulate the relevant changes to Standing Orders following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  The first item of business is the minutes of our meetings of 18 May and 20 May 2021, which have been circulated to members.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s webpage.<\/p> <p>  There are no accounts or financial statements for consideration this week.<\/p> <p>  Moving to correspondence, as agreed, items not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated.

It was also agreed to request a comprehensive report from the Department regarding the overall position on the transfer of properties and payments from religious congregations to the State, including details of the impediments to transfers and payments and why the processes have taken so long.  We also agreed to request that the Department keep the committee informed regarding the status of properties that remain to be transferred.<\/p> <p>  This has dragged on for a long time.

We did get a report on that in relation to this piece of correspondence.  As was said, this goes back to the indemnity agreement.  The nation was appalled by the Ryan report where there were voluntary transfers. People took it at face value that there would be goodwill behind these, given that in 2009 they were offered.<\/p> <p>  As it was a long list, the last Committee of Public Accounts focused on it.  We started to see a considerable amount of progress made on some of the outstanding transfers.  These transfers were offered in the context of reports that absolutely horrified the nation in terms of the abuse of children.  It probably would come as a surprise to people that the transfer is still not completed, both from the 2002 and 2009 offers.  The State picked up a very sizeable burden while the religious institutions involved got off very lightly in terms of the overall cost.<\/p> <p>  It is just unacceptable that we still have some of these outstanding at this stage.  We must ensure the Department of Education continues to get these properties fully transferred and that we can close off on this.  It is obvious that voluntary transfers in this kind of scenario are something from which we should learn a lesson.  It simply should never happen again.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, the people who lose out on this are the people who have been impacted by it.  Obviously, we sought this information in the context of Caranua which was set up to assist some of those affected by what was effectively incarceration.  We need that report from the Department on the impediments on all of those transfers, as well as the findings and the learnings from the difference between where there was an indemnity agreement and where there was not.<\/p> <p>  There has to be some closure on this.  If it had not been for the last Committee of Public Accounts, that list would be longer.

This and a number of similar responses were received following our decision at our meeting of 23 March to write to all Departments to request information on protected disclosures since the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  We considered 11 responses last week and a further six responses are before us today.  The final response has been received and will be circulated for next week's meeting.

Having engaged with some people who have made protected disclosures or who are whistleblowers, I know that not everyone who makes a protected disclosure will be found to be 100% correct or whatever.  We are now at a point where it is unsatisfactory for many people who make protected disclosures, and this committee has met some people in that context.  It is important that we gather the full set of replies.  There is a directive we have to transpose by the end of the year in regard to widening the number of people who can make protected disclosures, so it would be very useful to have that overview and learning.  Not every committee has what the Committee of Public Accounts has, namely, an overview of all Departments, so we are probably well placed to do that.<\/p><p>We can gather the information in the first instance but I believe we have to do something more than that in considering just exactly how effective it is.

It is important in the first instance that we have a standard collating mechanism so it will be easy to identify the number of protected disclosure declarations made and the number upheld.  The statistics I can glean from the correspondence we have received so far would not inspire many people to make a protected disclosure.  The rate at which disclosures and complaints are upheld is incredibly low.  It would be useful for this committee, at some stage in the medium term, to carry out a full analysis of the experience of those who make protected disclosures and how they are dealt with by various Departments and agencies.  The protected disclosures mechanism was considered by the Oireachtas to be an important route by which wrongdoing, maladministration, error or erroneous practices could be identified safely.  We are looking at evidence from across several Departments indicating that protected disclosures are left in an administration process for a long number of years.  At the end of the day, no action is taken on the vast majority of disclosures.  That is not to suggest that there will not always be frivolous or unsubstantiated claims or allegations in these processes but the number of claims that are dismissed, passed on to somebody else or left sitting idle for many years points to a worrying practice.  Therefore, there is work in this regard that this committee could usefully do.

The correspondence we have from the Garda ombudsman's office is dated 30 March, which basically indicates that, due to constraints in terms of resources, there has been no progress, or at least no ability to outline a timeframe.  However, on 9 May, I noted in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>quite an amount of information that at least appeared to be extrapolated from the Garda ombudsman's report.  It even goes so far as to indicate it is unlikely there will be any criminal proceedings.  Clearly, somebody has information with regard to this.  This follows a well-worn pattern with regard to many State agencies in that where allegations of a very serious nature are made, the official response is to delay and procrastinate for so long that, by the time findings are released publicly, it is too late to do something about them or hold those responsible to account.  Sometimes this crosses several agencies.  I propose that we write back to the Garda ombudsman on the basis of the media reports from 9 May asking for a further update and that we ask the Garda again whether it has received correspondence from the ombudsman and OLAF and whether, on that basis, it can inform us about the current status of these investigations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#C00800","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I have not seen the media report the Deputy is referring to but it is most likely based on confidential information from a source.

At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item and agreed that any future engagement would include both the IHRB and Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  We also requested clarity regarding the number of racetracks covered by CCTV.  The response is No. 597B, which states: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe 2018 Budget provided &euro;60,000 for the installation of CCTV.  This was estimated to cover three racecourses at an estimated cost of &euro;20,000 per racecourse.  The 2019 budget provided &euro;80,000 for the installation of CCTV.  This was estimated to cover four racecourses again based on a cost of &euro;20,000 per racecourse.  The figures included are estimates and had the project commenced a full procurement process would have had to have been completed before the projects could have commenced. <\/blockquote><p>What is peculiar about this is, according to the statement, money was provided for seven.  We know from previous engagements when HRI representatives were before the committee that only one racecourse in the three-year period had CCTV provided and there was a plan to provide CCTV in one more.  In total, there are 25 racecourses to be covered.  The overall figure was, as I recall, &euro;18 million with money being reused for other purposes.  The response would seem to be completely unsatisfactory.  The response said that the cost of installing CCTV was estimated at &euro;20,000 per racecourse.  It seems three or four tracks were covered.  It is clear that when we take the combined sum there is money provided for seven.<\/p><p> In further correspondence, reference is made to the procurement process commencing for all racecourses.

I wish to bring that to the attention of committee members.<\/p> <p>  We would be hopeful that this would happen.  We dealt with this matter and the organisation earlier in the year.  We dealt with the lack of progress and the fact that only one has been done.  There was confusion over the earlier response and the way it was written.  There was a question over whether the response covered three or four racetracks or three quarters of all racetracks.  It is three or four.  In fact, it is three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#D00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>From looking at the response of the IHRB, anyone would think the provision of CCTV was progressing or proceeding perfectly as normal.

We have to ask questions at this stage given that we have had representatives before us and we have had engagement.  Why would those responsible not seek to speed up the delivery of CCTV given that it would protect the integrity of the sport?  What is the reason for the delay?  There must be some reason the provision of CCTV is not one of the priorities of the regulatory board.  In itself that leads to questions.  Those responsible seem to have been dragging their heels a little from the get-go, even to the extent that they transferred money that had been allocated for CCTV for another online portal, which raises serious questions.<\/p> <p>  The correspondence addresses my reference to the online integrity portal.  The board seems to take issue with my language.

It will come as a surprise to many people who attend universities how precarious the employment can be for some of those who are delivering lectures.

During a hearing and in subsequent correspondence, it emerged that Maynooth University was operating a bizarre system whereby hourly staff were required to claim their holiday entitlements by submitting paper forms.  Hourly workers across society are more prone to being exploited and it is important in a forum such as our higher education sector that we have a robust system in place whereby people receive their entitlements.  As well as compiling the detail as to how many hourly workers institutes employ, I suggest we ask the HEA to clarify whether it can say with confidence that all workers with hourly-type contracts receive statutory holiday pay as of course, rather than having to implement some convoluted system for entitlements to be claimed.

In RT&Eacute;, there are people on genuine contracts on a temporary basis, but these were people who should have been directly employed.<\/p> <p>  The Eversheds report permitted this form of employment to go back a couple of years.  If it goes back a couple of years, but employees have essentially been in casual employment for six, seven, eight or ten years or whatever, that is the status they should have had for that time.  It follows from that that there are entitlements from being employed as opposed to being self-employed in the context of, for example, pension or welfare entitlements or whatever.  Essentially, it is to get to the net point, in acknowledging whether these 78 people were in permanent employment, that it is retrospective.

The correspondence indicates that three of the top ten earners are represented by the same agent, NK Management, which would appear to be a very successful rate if an agency delivers 30% of the high earners.<\/p> <p>  The fundamental issue that arises is that RT&Eacute;, even in comparison with other semi-State bodies, is unique, in that every household in the country is obliged to pay a charge for the running of that company and that company is also then charged with revealing information that is clearly in the public interest.  It is clearly in the public interest when a semi-State body has to make a voluntary contribution to the Revenue Commissioners because its policies were in breach of the law.  That is when a contribution and a payment have to be made to Revenue.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that the very people who would normally expose and investigate this work for the company involved and, therefore, there is an impetus and an obligation on RT&Eacute; to be more upfront than any other body in disclosing the exact nature of the payment.  The question we put was: how much has it already paid to Revenue?  That does not impede ongoing discussions RT&Eacute; is having with either Revenue or with the Department of Social Protection.  It is to outline how much has already been expended.  As Deputy Munster said, it took quite a number of different questions - and it was the Chair who eventually put the wording in such a way that RT&Eacute; had to respond - to find out that this payment had actually been made.  When I further pressed RT&Eacute; on how much that payment was, the response was that the information was not to hand.

We know that.  If the details were made publicly available, we would not have to ask for them.  In my view, it is unacceptable that RT&Eacute; would hide behind a disclosure provision that information not be made publicly available.  I agree with Deputy Munster's proposal that the committee correspond with Revenue on the general position.  Anybody who is knowledgeable in this area knows that if somebody makes a payment to Revenue, it will not publish the details in that regard, but it will not object to somebody else publishing them.  That is the course these matters take. <\/p><p> To maintain its integrity and reputation and its ability to investigate and challenge others, RT&Eacute; has an obligation to publish this information as a matter of urgency and without undue delay.  I suggest that the committee, in its correspondence with RT&Eacute;, outline in the strongest possible terms the committee's dissatisfaction that this figure has not been outlined as of yet and to ask for a timeframe as to when it will be disclosed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#G00900","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>To draw the pieces together on this matter, No. 588 from S&eacute;amus Dooley, the Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, is related to this matter.  It is brief, but Mr. Dooley states in his letter that he welcomes the interest of the Committee of Public Accounts in the issue of bogus self-employment which has long been of concern to the NUJ, the RT&Eacute; trade union group, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  He concludes that the Eversheds Sutherland process agreed with the RT&Eacute; group of unions is ongoing in RT&Eacute; insofar as the issue of retrospection remains unresolved.  I bring that to the attention of the meeting so that members will know where the process may be at.  Mr. Dooley clearly states that the matter remains unresolved.  He does not indicate that there has been any great progress on it.  With the agreement of members, we will take No. 586 from Mr. Dooley with this correspondence.  He has provided helpful information.<\/p> <p>  Arising out of the discussion on this matter, I cannot see why a public service broadcaster, which has made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners, an arm of the State that works on behalf of the taxpayer, cannot disclose to the Committee of Public Accounts how much of a settlement it made to Revenue.  I had to drag out of RT&Eacute; that it made a settlement.  We need to know the amount of that settlement and when it was made.  I propose that the committee secretariat correspond with RT&Eacute; advising it that we expect answers to those questions and that it is unacceptable that the committee has not received answers to date.

We have received a letter from the Department of Justice in regard to the legal costs and compensation paid in respect of legal claims managed by the Irish Prison Service.  The Department is very definitely saying that the Irish Prison Service manages that area but, as we know, the State Claims Agency will handle some of the claims.  This is a dangerous environment so there will be claims.  We need to make sure that where something happens, we try insofar as is possible to ensure that it does not happen again.  For example, there was a significant TB outbreak in one year.<\/p> <p>  That same correspondence references the number of claims and the number of them that were handled by the Prison Service.  Further on, it references the compensation paid in respect of claims in the years 2014 to 2020, and the number of claims and the amounts are provided.  There is a considerable difference between one and the other.  The other has to have been managed by the State Claims Agency.  It is difficult to properly interrogate this information in the absence of full sight of the issues that arose.  In one of the responses, there is a table which shows that exposure to behavioural hazards is pretty high, but one would expect to see that.  However, in the case of physical hazards there is no detail on each hazard or the response to make sure it has been addressed.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult when we get a set of figures and we can see the legal fees in respect to the claims managed by the Prison Service, but we cannot separate out the compensation or the legal fees from the point of view of the total compensation paid in terms of claims.  I would like to know the relationship or ratio in relation to the legal fees aspect.  Pretty often, legal fees amount to nearly as much as the compensation claim.  This is about how we change how we do things in terms of mediated settlements and so on, as opposed to cases going through the courts system or a very legal process.  We need some more information for those years from the State Claims Agency on the ratio of legal fees to compensation and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#H00500","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I will bring in Mr. McCarthy at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#H00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621931400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I want to point out to Deputy Murphy that there are two documents from the Department of Justice.

In relation to that, there are damages amounts, payments in relation to lack of in-cell sanitation and in relation to tuberculosis mass action.  Those are the State Claims Agency ones, whereas the ones in the letter itself are the ones that are handled by the Department.<\/p><p>There is the difficulty with any of this when one looks at it on a year-by-year basis.

For example, where a prison officer is injured in work and is out for six months, there would be medical costs and compensation paid.  What is the relationship between that and the legal costs?  Is there a kind of an open disclosure approach in the same way there is an acceptance of liability?  Does one cut down on costs by virtue of the fact that one does not have to be overly legalistic in some cases?<\/p> <p>  I am not saying that the State should roll over and pay compensation willy-nilly.

The catalyst for this examination was the recent significant increase in the remuneration for the post of Secretary General of the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  We also have correspondence before us today, No. 594B, from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, also declining the joint committee&rsquo;s invitation to appear before it on this matter. <\/p> <p>  However, I understand that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has now agreed to appear before the joint committee on 16 June and that the Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach will appear before the committee on 2 June.<\/p> <p>  The joint committee is awaiting a reply from the Secretary General of the Department of Health who has also been invited to attend the meeting on 2 June.  The joint committee is also awaiting a response from the Taoiseach's office as to when he will be available to appear before it on this matter.  As per our agreement with the joint committee, four members of this committee will participate in the meetings on this topic.<\/p> <p>  At our meeting last week, we agreed to write to the finance committee to convey our dissatisfaction with the fact that TLAC had declined the joint committee&rsquo;s request.  However, I understand the joint committee has issued another invitation to TLAC to appear before it on 17 June.  On that basis, it is not proposed to write to the joint committee on this matter.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to the Cathaoirleach of the finance committee about this.  He confirmed it had requested TLAC to come before it on 17 June.  In its correspondence, TLAC stated its remit is to recommended candidates to Ministers and the Government for the most senior positions but that it does not have a role in the remuneration, benefits and conditions.  It also stated it has no involvement in or knowledge of the processes or procedures by which remuneration, conditions or benefits are determined.<\/p> <p>  Given what has happened in this case, and as one of the four members of this committee who can attend joint meetings with the finance committee, I feel it is important TLAC appears before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052500002#J00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1621931400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the Committee of Public Accounts who are working alongside the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on this matter.<\/p> <p>  This is crucially important for all the reasons outlined so far.  I am glad to hear that the Minister has, after a little bit of persuasion, agreed to attend.  The very fact that he was refusing to in one instance is simply disgraceful.  Throughout this process when questions have been raised, either by this committee or on the floor of the D&aacute;il, senior Ministers have responded by implying that anybody who suggested that questions needed to be answered were undermining TLAC's authority to carry out its job and questioning the independence of the TLAC process.<\/p> <p>  It is imperative that TLAC answers questions on the rationale as to how it came up with the appointment that every single person knew it was going to make back in January or December when it was first announced as a temporary appointment.

The rationale given in December and January by the Government was that a figure such as this was needed in order to attract the best and the brightest in the world.  Little did we know that the best and brightest in the world was just around the corner from us all along in the form of a Secretary General in another Department.  Who would have thought it?<\/p> <p>  We need to get a further rationale as to the basis of that increase and why it was agreed and warranted.  Can we get some clarification or indication as to whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sees this increased salary provided for this post as the basis for future pay claims?  If and when a vacancy arises in another Department, will this pay scale have any implications for that?

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach were on the top tier.  Suddenly the Department of Health - perhaps it should have been at that level &ndash; has leapfrogged, very substantially.  There was discussion and concern about the knock-on consequences, and that increased salaries have been from the top-down rather than the bottom-up.  We know there are many people in various sectors who have been told that there are potential knock-on consequences.

Are members okay with correspondence No. 595B?<\/p> <p>  Correspondence No. 601B, which I referred to earlier, from Mr. David Gunning, chief officer of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, dated 19 May, provides information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the board on 9 February.  We requested this information on 16 February.  At this stage, it is well over two months overdue.  We note and publish this item.  Regarding this item of correspondence, No. 601B, from Mr. Gunning, chief officer, I do not know about the rest of the members, but I find this process totally unsatisfactory, that he answers and comes back on a number of issues we raised.  He raised an issue and quoted me as saying, \"As soon as the findings of that report are available, I ask that they be forwarded to the secretariat of the committee.\"  He answers that but he said that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board&rsquo;s analysis has been submitted to the Department of Health for independent analysis and scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  Members will recall that last November, we asked members of this board and a representative from the Department of Health to come before us.  They subsequently requested that the meeting be delayed until January because their report on progress of the children&rsquo;s hospital project was not ready, nor was there any indication of the final cost.  We put it back to January and they subsequently looked for it to be deferred to February, which we did.  Board members came before us on 11 February and at that meeting, they promised to have the report before us in March.  We are now sailing close to the month of June, halfway through the year, and we still do not have that report, and we do not have that board in front of us.  Board members were due to come before us two weeks ago, but they were not in a position to do so because the report was not ready.<\/p> <p>  The process has dragged on for an inordinate length of time.  I note that one of the central issues we raised with them on the day there were before us was in relation to claims made by the main contractor.  Many of us were surprised to hear that there were in the region of 700 financial claims being made by the main contractor against the board.  The reply in this correspondence stated that 450 of them entered a dispute management process.  Since the day they were before us, 100 extra claims have been made.  The correspondence goes on to state that there are now four cases, there were three, before the High Court and that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board initiated High Court proceedings relating to the contractor disputing the validity of phase B.  The board has initiated that case.  It is still of great concern.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that I am concerned about is that the position of chair has not been filled.  It is stated in the correspondence, that the previous chair, Fred Barry, indicated in January that he was to resign, and he bowed out in February.  It is understood &ndash; there is nothing definite about this - that the Public Appointments Service will work through the applications in the coming weeks and should a suitable candidate be identified from this process the names will be forwarded to the Minister for Health for consideration for appointment.

I welcome the officials and thank them for their two comprehensive submissions.  I have a couple of points and questions.  They are specific to each of the two areas, namely, the rewetting of bogs and horticultural peat, although there is a bit of a link between the two.  Starting with the rewetting of bogs, I seek some clarification from the witnesses further to the contents of their submission.  In the larger scheme of things, with the anticipated sequestration and storage of carbon, who do the officials see getting credit for the carbon, going forward?  This is a big debate in the agriculture sector about whether the carbon that is sequestered or stored in Irish lands would be accredited to the sector.  I would like some comment on that from the officials.  To whom do they see the credit being given?<\/p><p>On another point, I might quote a paragraph from the officials' submission:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Government&rsquo;s approach, as set out in the National Peatlands Strategy, is to recognise that domestic turf cutters have a traditional right to cut turf and that this right is balanced with the conservation objectives for protected bogs and the legal obligations on the State. <\/blockquote> <p>I would like the officials to comment on that, based on the fact that at the moment, Bord na M&oacute;na, which is answerable to the Department in this regard, is not issuing licences to people who have turbary rights or who need a Bord na M&oacute;na licence to cut to turf on what were traditionally their family banks, which are leased from Bord na M&oacute;na.  Why are the officials not intervening there to back up what their submission states?<\/p><p>On the horticultural peat, the comprehensive report the officials have given us and all the work done to date is quoting investment and research into alternatives, while at the same time we have ceased production.  Is that not putting the cart before the horse?  I have the two reports in my hand and while I see fully and welcome the possibilities of carbon sequestration and storage by wetting our peatlands, I cannot see the justification for the current situation, nor justify it to members of the public who question it.  Last week, I spoke to a haulier who specialises in peat haulage and he is currently drawing peat from the port of Drogheda down to the south of the country.  This is peat that has come into this country from, I think, Lithuania, transported on a diesel-burning ship, loaded onto his lorry and transported down the country because the officials' Department cannot or did not intervene in the scenario through the courts and through the planning process, which has horticultural peat production ceased at the moment.  This despite the officials openly saying in their statement that we are now, and only now, investing in research for alternatives.  That is certainly putting the cart before the horse and a serious contradiction between the two submissions from the Department.  I would like a little more elaboration on that point also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#A00300","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Who wants to take the Senator's questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#A00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I will take the first question on carbon credits.  The restoration of Ireland's bogs will give many benefits in terms of carbon sequestration, storage and capture.  At the moment there is no policy in place, no measure for the trading of carbon credits for peatlands restoration.  However, this is an evolving area and the Department with the responsibility for any policy in that regard is the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am aware the UK has a peatlands code in place and there have been a number of measures undertaken in other member states.  It is expected that the restoration of over 22,000 ha of raised bog habitat within the special areas of conservation natural heritage area network will directly reduce and halt carbon loss, meet our national conservation targets and result in estimated emissions reductions of 47,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.<\/p> <p>  On the right to cut turf, as was stated, the National Peatlands Strategy recognises the domestic turfcutter has a traditional right to cut turf and this is respected.

The aim of the restoration and rewetting of the bogs is to raise the water levels in the bog to at or below the surface to encourage the growth of sphagnum moss, which is the building block of peat.

A working group has been set up to discuss the effects that the ban on peat harvesting will have on the horticultural industry.  The group has only just given its interim report to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the recommendations are weeks away from being published.  Is the Department aware that suppliers to the industry are fearful that they could go out of business by September if the harvesting and horticultural period is not allowed?<\/p> <p>  I want to put it on record that when we talk about horticultural peat use in the mushroom industry, over 80% of the mushroom industry is peat free and that only 15% of the peat base is necessary to allow mushrooms to sprout.  Does the Department have concerns about alternatives to horticultural peats such as coir and so on?  They will need to have fertilisers, nutrients and bio-stimulants added to them.  The run-off from these additives will have an impact on water courses, rewetted bogs, potentially, and ultimately on pollution levels.  This is a requirement with the ban on horticultural peat, which goes against the farm to fork strategy that we all have heard about.<\/p> <p>  Is there a case for the moss peat industry to continue to harvest peat on a case-by-case basis?  I mean where binding guarantees are given that cut-over bogs post harvest will be allowed to regenerate ecologically in perpetuity and that whatever post harvest activities is allowed.<\/p> <p>  On rewetting bogs, at a meeting of this committee in March Dr. David Wilson spoke about the Abbeyleix project where no flooding was reported and said that it was a role model.

Thankfully, it appears that the Office of Public Works, OPW, has reversed course and will now facilitate the installation of an overflow pipe but we see the very significant consequences if these things are not got right.

It states, \"the impact of the restoration measures to surrounding lands is kept to a minimum.\"  That is very different from saying that the impact will be minimal.  What does Ms Nally consider to be the acceptable impact on adjoining lands, and going back to that question, is that spelled out for adjoining landowners and what engagement takes place between them?<\/p><p>If this process develops correctly it can be a huge amenity, not only in terms of carbon sequestration but also biodiversity and all of the rest.

As someone who grew up looking out at a bog I am conscious that they were thousands of years in formation and there is a lot more there than 30 years.  There are a lot of imponderable facts when one is looking at rewetting.<\/p> <p>  I take on board what the witnesses said about consultation with farmers and that there is an opportunity for farmers to have their land bought out if they do not want to go down other roads.  Farmers may not want a project to go ahead at all.  Climate is changing.  We have seen how we have struggled to cope with flooding.  Over the past ten years we have seen multiple examples of that right across the country.  I have some questions on the nub of the issue.<\/p> <p>  If the NPWS comes to my farm gate to take me through a consultation process and I am somewhat sceptical and ask a representative to show me how the process will evolve, can I see a time-lapse video of what will happen over the next ten, 40 or 60 years and how it will impact my farm or the likely impact it will have?  Is there any provision in such a time-lapse video for freak weather patterns?  We have had a number of exceptionally wet winters.  If they happened again, is that factored into how the process will evolve over ten, 20 or 40 years?<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the ESB.  How involved is it in this process, in particular where there has been large-scale peat production in midland areas which is now coming to an end?  We all appreciate the merits of rewetting boglands.  The ESB has responsibility for the control of water levels on the River Shannon.  As much as rewetting the boglands will have an impact, the biggest impact on water levels on bogs is what happens on the River Shannon and how it is controlled. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the plans the NPWS has for the midlands, specifically Longford-Westmeath, how engaged is the ESB with that process?  If we asked the ESB to open sluice gates it simply would not happen.  Is the ESB in agreement with the plans of the NPWS?  Is it on the end of the phone?

To date, the Department has relocated 106 turf cutters from 12 designated raised bogs sites to non-designated relocation sites.  Work on a number of other potential relocation sites is moving through the process.  Some of those may require planning permission.  To date, the Department has received planning permission for two relocation sites in County Galway and these sites have been fully developed and are now operational.

Families depend on turf for fuel.  Approximately 40% of the houses in County Offaly alone depend on turf as their own source of solid fuel and heating.  One of the speakers made the point that it is important that turf cutters are respected.  I would go further.  Turf cutters have been subjected to a creeping criminalisation,  It has been unfair, unwarranted and very upsetting for many families with which I have dealt.  I have dealt with turf cutters.  I want to state that clearly in bringing their concerns to the table.<\/p> <p>  It is not enough to respect them.  Turf cutters and the tradition of turf cutting must be protected.  It is an activity which is part of our heritage.  Heritage is part of the Department's remit.  A proposal I want considered is for turf cutting to be made a heritage activity and protected under EU or international law.  There are examples of that in the EU, to which we have already alluded.  We are very quick to allude to the EU when it comes to climate change.  Let us consider the EU's practices in protecting activities which are part of heritage.  That needs to be done.  I have put forward that proposal because heritage is part of the Department's remit.  I emphasise it is not enough to respect turf cutters, we must protect them, as they have been subjected to much unfair, creeping criminalisation.  Many households in my constituency depend on turf.  Generations of families look forward to cutting turf, as they have always done.  Let us not criminalise people and let us ensure they get more than just respect or tokenism.  We need to ensure that turf cutting is protected.<\/p> <p>  I support the points made by Deputies Daly and Harkin on the carbon sequestration of bogs.  I hope our bogs will not be treated like our fisheries, which were sold out.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, feels strongly about this issue.  We need to ensure  our bogs are not sold out and that Irish agriculture is not dealt a raw deal.  Carbon sequestration credits should be given to Irish agriculture.  That must be done.  I make that point strongly in support of the speakers who raised the issue.<\/p> <p>  There has been some consultation on the rewetting of bogs.  I have attended meetings with representatives of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the Irish Farmers Association.  More needs to be done.  There has been some degree of consultation on the rewetting of bogs but not enough.  Bord na M&oacute;na has assured landowners in this respect but its assurances are not written agreements.  I have said to Bord na M&oacute;na previously that it needs to provide written agreements that the rewetting of bogs will not affect landowners.  I cannot understand why Bord na M&oacute;na should be paid money for bog rehabilitation before it provides such written assurances.  That does not make sense.

We wish him well in his retirement.<\/p> <p>  The vast majority of people would agree that rewetting of bogs can have great environmental benefits.  For the adjoining farmers, however, the Department has said that it wants to proceed with agreement.  But the downside, disadvantages or problems for a farmer might not appear for 12 months, two years or three years.  The effects on a water table, for example, most definitely would not be seen overnight.  Can a protocol be put in place whereby if a farmer has issues appearing in any period of time after the rewetting of the bogs, those issues would be addressed?  That would go a long way to addressing the fears farmers have about the rewetting.  One could agree to it now, and everything would be grand at the moment, but somewhere down the road the rewetting could have a seriously negative impact on the productivity of neighbouring land.  It would be greatly appreciated if a protocol could be put in place with a mechanism to deal with any ongoing issues, with a guarantee to the landowners that they would be dealt with to his or her satisfaction.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of horticultural peat, the committee had a meeting some months ago when Mr. Lucas gave a presentation.  We were told that the working group would report in early to mid-April on the harvesting of horticultural peat.  We are now in the last week of May and we still have not had the report.  I would like it to go back to the Department that the committee is seeking an immediate update on that.  I am getting calls constantly from people who have private bogs and who want to cut horticultural peat.  The year is slipping by very quickly.  As Senator Paul Daly has said, it is environmental and economic madness to be doing what is happening at the moment.  Earlier in the year, this committee got a commitment that we would have an interim report on that aspect.  My firm recollection is that we were told it would be with us by early to mid-April.  I would like a written update to our members as quickly as possible.  This is a huge issue, on which we were given commitments that have not been adhered to.  I will speak to the committee secretariat when this meeting is finished and we will put a letter to the Minister to that effect.

I know that Mr. Pettit and his team head the educational sector in Teagasc.  I studied horticulture under ACOT, the predecessor of Teagasc.  That was a good while ago.  I acknowledge the importance of Teagasc and its work on training.  I will make a few comments and ask a few questions.  On many occasions, we have discussed in this committee the question of what a farmer is.  I am more interested in what is a trained farmer.  Teagasc covers that in its prospectus.  It talks about the national policy, which is the Government's priority, of training farmers for various farm incentives.  One thing that occurred to me during the Covid-19 pandemic when many young people from transition year were out of school is that we never really got back to full education.  There is an agricultural science module in the leaving certificate, yet we know that young people are hungry to learn, particularly if they live on farms.  I believe there is a disconnect between the Department of Education and Teagasc, and I would like Mr. Pettit to comment on it.  Many young people have said they would love to see a module of the GreenStart as part of transition year.  They are young, keen and ambitious.  They are working and living on the land, and they are potentially the successors to many farms and land.  That is very important, because that is the way to go.  We have students going on to do agriculture in the leaving certificate, but they know very little in terms of applied agriculture after that.  There is a disconnect there.<\/p> <p>  I have looked at Teagasc's prospectus.  As agriculture, horticulture and forestry have got more complex, the entry requirements for many Teagasc courses have gone up.  It is very important we do not dissociate the practicalities of agriculture and require people to have a number of points from the leaving certificate examination to access courses.  There is an important entry there, but there is a more important entry at another level.  There are many young people who left school at 15 years of age and who are running massive farms in this country.  They learned this trade from being a young lad on the farm.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Pettit might touch on how Teagasc is preparing its students and graduates for the challenges and expectations of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, because there will be educational standards feeding into that, which is important.<\/p> <p>  I will wrap up with a few points.  The synergy I am talking about is the practicalities of a 50:50 in terms of practical applied agriculture, horticulture or forestry versus the academic, because that is important.  How is Teagasc interacting with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in terms of farming apprenticeship, learning the trade with one's hands from the bottom up?  What interested me more, and I could not get much information on this when I looked into Teagasc's work and reports, is how Teagasc is preparing people for agribusiness planning, financial management, governance and compliance.  That is an important issue.  How is it dealing with artisan foods?  We know one will not make a full living from the farm so there is added diversification and all that goes with that.  How about the issues of smart farming, position farming, central technology, automation and robotics?  That is an entirely new area of learning for young farmers.<\/p> <p>  In terms of looking back on Teagasc's students and graduates, what analysis does it do of the students who come through Teagasc courses, a look-back graduate survey?  What does that show?  Are people staying in agriculture?  Are they moving up the chain in terms of management in agriculture, forestry and horticulture?  Where are they after going through some of Teagasc's courses?<\/p> <p>  Teagasc is a very positive organisation, but cautious.  The one question I have today is about how we can prepare our new graduates and new students in respect of compliance, the environmental objectives and so forth, the issues with the new CAP and how we are facing them, and how we are dealing with technology in agriculture.  The latter is very important.  It is cutting edge stuff.  In addition, we must not forget that there are young people who may never achieve a State examination, but who have a hunger and yearning for learning and practical knowledge.  It is very important that we do not close the door in some way and tell them they do not qualify for entry into courses because they do not have X number of points.  There are different levels.<\/p> <p>  Finally, and I will shut up after this point, I believe in apprenticeships and in learning the trade from the bottom up.  I want to hear about how Teagasc is planning to conduct hands-on apprenticeship in farming.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses again.  As a student of horticulture, having known it, having mentored people in this area and still doing it, I believe it is very important that we draw on the uniqueness of individuals and enhance them to be our next generation of farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#G00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Those were quite extensive questions for the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#G00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I will begin and then hand over to my colleague, Dr. Stan Lalor.  In terms of school links, that is very important.  There is always room for improvement with regard to working with the schools.  All our colleges have quite an involvement with schools through inviting people to the colleges each year.  With Agri Aware we take in approximately 3,000 students annually in March for the walk and talk exercise.  We also have open days on careers for transition year, fifth year and sixth year students.  There is quite an amount of work on that.  On the Teagasc public website we have resources that are available for second level schools.  Some of my colleagues in the advisory regions are also looking at pilot projects to work with and visit schools to explain about Teagasc and to explain farming and food and where farming fits in the food chain.  There is ongoing work on that, but it is a work in progress.  I fully accept that we need to work more because these people are important for the future.<\/p> <p>  With regard to entry requirements, we have both higher education courses and further education courses.  There is no educational requirement, as such, for our full-time further education courses in which one attends one of our agricultural colleges.  It is an age-based requirement.  One has to be 17 years of age on the January after one enters.  It is similar for our part-time courses.  It is adult education so it is more age based.  We operate an accelerated programme and we have an entry requirement for that.  However, that is an accelerated programme where people who already have another award can do the programme faster.  In our higher education, there are entry Central Applications Office, CAO, points for Teagasc-linked higher education courses, but they are set by the higher education institutions.<\/p> <p>  As regards CAP, we are certainly looking at that.  In 2018, Teagasc concluded the Teagasc education vision exercise.<\/p><p>At the forefront of that exercise were the requirements for the young farmers of the future.  That consultation involved many stakeholders, including a couple of hundred farmers and a range of farming organisations and agencies.  Sustainability was identified as the major area, and compliance and governance were also identified as being particularly important.  In addition, smart farming, digital and the business area were also highlighted.  Within this as well, however, technical areas would also remain important.<\/p><p> As the courses and curriculums are reviewed, we must work with the awarding body, which is Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  These are not Teagasc awards anymore.  Each time the award comes up for review, however, we examine the changing requirements.  Sustainability and all these areas will have an increasingly strong focus within the awards.  Modules exist in areas such as business, but also in technology and digital technology.  We also have a farm planning programme at level 6 that takes students through the whole farm planning exercise for their business, not only if they want to stay in farming but also in case they might want to consider other options.  The students are therefore appraising their future in respect of land resources and the options that may be available outside farming.  <\/p><p>  The education vision exercise also recommended that we focus more on the entrepreneurial aspect of how farmers use their resources for the future.  We are bearing that aspect in mind.  The other point which came through in the report was that we need to focus on improving the problem-solving skills of farmers in the next generation, because it is very much an industry centred on problem solving.  What is required in that regard is not just imparting theory but also helping people to gain practical skills.  <\/p><p> Turning to apprenticeships, this again is an area that came through in the education vision report and it is one we are keen to progress.  In the last call for apprenticeship proposals, Teagasc submitted five land sector apprenticeship proposals on behalf of the industry.  Two were in farming, one at level 6 to qualify as a farm technician and one at level 7 to gain an ordinary degree in farm management.  We also submitted two proposals in the area of horticulture, one in applied horticulture and one in sports turf, as well as one in the area of equine studies.  Those proposals are in the development stage and it is a long process to approval.  We are working on the quality assurance frameworks for those five apprenticeships which we hope to submit to QQI this summer.  Hopefully, the first of those apprenticeships will go to QQI for validation this autumn.  Other bodies have audited these proposals as well, including SOLAS, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and employers.  The work is in progress and we hope those five apprenticeship schemes will all be launched and up and running by the end of 2022.<\/p><p> Turning to the graduate survey look back, we already carried out a look-back survey of graduates who qualified five years ago.  The key findings from that survey are that the majority of people, based on their replies to the survey, are still involved in farming and have quickly got involved, in a matter of years, in the management aspect of their farms.  Looking back over the survey replies, some 90% of the people who responded are involved at a management level in a farm, either through a partnership or as the manager within five years of qualifying from the course.  We also find that more than 70% of respondents indicate they have increased their level of farming activity.  We also look at the numbers who join farming discussion groups, such as profit monitor uptake and all those areas, and a significant number are implementing the practices we recommend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Pettit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pettit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#H00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of Teagasc and welcome them.  I have several questions.  To follow on somewhat from the questions posed by Senator Boyhan regarding Teagasc's input into the curriculum for agricultural science as a subject at second level, I would like to see Teagasc having more of an input in that regard.  I ask Mr. Pettit to comment on Teagasc's current role in that regard.  Regarding the green certificate - and I emphasise that I am asking a question here and not proffering an opinion - there were issues earlier in the year when many of the courses, especially those offered in conjunction with the ETBs, were well oversubscribed.  There were massive waiting lists for places and people could just not get on those courses.<\/p> <p>  Much of the commentary at the time focused on there being no way during the selection process to pick genuine student farmers.  I refer to students seeking to gain entry to these courses as a means of pursuing a career in agriculture or to take over the home farm.  I contrast those applicants with those who were just signing up possibly - and I reiterate that I am asking a question here and not proffering an opinion - to acquire a green certificate to facilitate property transfers.  Tax relief is available for the holders of green certificates.  Could Teagasc change its selection process to overcome that issue, if it was an issue?<\/p> <p>  In passing, I also mention the role of Teagasc in respect of farm safety when it comes to education in the agricultural sector.  While Teagasc already plays a role in this area and safety modules form part of the courses run in its agricultural colleges, and also in the courses run in conjunction with ETBs, and relevant information is also disseminated as part of its knowledge transfer schemes and shared with its clients, what about the people outside those loops?  Does Teagasc have plans to address the way it can educate and-or influence those people in respect of a subject as important as farm safety?  Teagasc does have a serious responsibility in respect of this role.  I refer not only to education in farm safety, but the implementation of farm safety.  I take serious issue with people who are not clients of Teagasc or who do not attend its courses not being addressed by the organisation concerning farm safety.  I feel this aspect must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I have communicated with Mr. Pettit regarding this next topic, which is an important one and many genuine people are impacted by it.  The age profiles for full-time college education, as well as the part-time courses, were mentioned already by Mr. Pettit.  Applicants must be over the age of 23 to get a place on the part-time course.  There have been situations where the health of the primary farmer, or whatever, has meant that the next generation to take over the farm, whether that is a young girl or a boy, must leave school once he or she reaches the age of 17.  Young people in this situation are staying at home to farm.  They are the next generation farmers and they require education in this area, but at the same time they are also providing essential labour on the farm.  <\/p> <p>   Such a situation may arise because of health constraints in the case of parents or the current farmer.  Those young people will not be able to leave the farm and go away to college full time.  People in that kind of situation are ideal candidates for the part-time course, and can do such a course, but they must wait until they are 23 years old.  I see the reasoning behind the age limits for entry to these courses, and if everybody could undertake these courses part time that would not be very good for the agricultural college system in future, but I respectfully request that Teagasc take a more considerate approach to exceptional and special cases, such as those I have described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#H00400","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#H00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Daly for his questions.  Regarding agricultural science resources, when the new curriculum was being established in this area we did have some consultation and input into that process with the Department of Education and Science, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, at the time.  We maintain links to try to help teachers of agricultural science at second level.  They approach Teagasc and we provide resources on our website for schools as well.  We are always willing to help.  Our Teagasc research centres and colleges are always there to support teachers with particular projects or if they need information from us.  We are certainly keen to help agricultural science teachers in any way we can.  If they want any kind of specific professional development opportunities with Teagasc, for example, we will facilitate such endeavours.  We indicated that to those teachers previously.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the selection process for the green certificate, we aim to accommodate all those applying for places on the course.  Demand has been strong for our adult education programmes, as we call them, in recent years.  Our courses are separate from those of the ETBs.  We are not linked.  Our courses are approved separately by QQI, as are those of the ETBs in their own right.  We try to take on and accommodate people as best we can on the courses we run.  Changing those selection criteria for our courses would be a matter for consideration by the Teagasc authority.  There is a challenge involved in trying to verify when people have a real need, as opposed to when they cannot be considered as much of a priority.  However, I will refer those comments back for consideration within Teagasc.  Similarly, in respect of the age requirement to be over 23 years old on entry, we certainly always look at individual cases and we have made exceptions for people whose circumstances, for bona fide reasons, mean they cannot enter our education courses in the normal fashion.<\/p><p>We try to make arrangements for them and not confine them to the courses for those over 23.  The course is validated and approved by QQI as one for people over 23 and by and large the expectation is that not all the people on it will be over 23.  We look at it on a case by case basis when these situations arise and have accommodated people who are under 23.<\/p><p> Safety is important in the Teagasc courses and there are modules on farm and food safety.  It is also built into all the skills activities within the courses so it is integrated in that regard.  We work with various organisations such as FBD and farm organisations on the Champions for Safety initiative that we run across the colleges.  Outside the colleges, the Teagasc advisory service also runs half-day or one-day courses on farm safety.  I take the point that other people may need to be accommodated and I will take that into consideration with our colleagues.  Dr. Lalor might like to comment on that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Pettit","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>As regards the Senator's question on farm safety, it is interrelated to how we educate our students in their awareness of farm safety.  There is a wider issue here in our reach with farmers on that topic.  I will highlight a few things.  In recent years we have changed and increased our resources in this area, such as the number of people engaged full-time in health and safety and our advisory structure.  We have separated internal health and safety issues from Teagasc and the people responsible for that from our outreach on health and safety to the farming community.  That is an area in which we are very active, in both research and advisory activities.  Regarding how we reach the wider clients, we obviously have reach with our clients but it is very important to reach the wider farming population as well.  Our ConnectEd programme, which is mentioned in our briefing note, is trying to reach a wider area.  On the one hand there are rural professionals working with this cohort of farmers with whom Teagasc might not have the same reach but the farmers themselves can also interact with that platform by attending webinars and various information outlets.  Within the overall knowledge transfer approach in Teagasc there is the wider area of interconnectivity in the agricultural knowledge innovation system, AKIS.  That is featuring very prominently in some of the discussions around European policy, particularly on CAP.  Within our knowledge transfer activities we are very conscious of not just dealing with the farmers we have as clients in our system but also reaching those wider farmers and the professionals who engage with them, whether private consultants or people working in agri-input industries professional services and so on.  That is an area in which we are active and want to continue developing more and more.  Health and safety is particularly relevant and important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stan Lalor"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I again thank our guests for coming along to this meeting.  The committee is united.  We are not united on many things but we are certainly united in the view that education in the agrifood sector is crucially important if we are to sustain and develop the sector in Ireland and meet the many challenges coming down the line.  I have a brief question on the Covid response.  Teagasc students were given, by and large, the same supports as other higher education students during the course of the pandemic, such as the laptop scheme and so on.  From responses I have received to parliamentary questions and FOI requests, it appears these supports were provided from within Teagasc&rsquo;s existing budget and that no additional supports were given by the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to those schemes.  I ask our guests to confirm whether that is the case.<\/p><p>To touch again on green certs, does Teagasc feel it has the capacity to deal with all of those applications?  Is there currently a waiting list or backlog?  What numbers of new applicants does it expect next year and can it deal with those numbers?  Is there a need to work with the ETB sector?  What role does Teagasc see for the ETB further education centres in delivering green certs into the future?  I understand that ETBs can access funds through the national training fund to provide green cert course.  Does Teagasc have the same access to those resources?  I ask the witnesses to provide clarification on that.<\/p><p>Some of the parliamentary questions I submitted to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on green certs were transferred to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who then told me he did not have any oversight of green certs within ETBs.  It appears that without the likes of Teagasc being given a very clear role in directing the green cert output, we could have a serious loss of direction.  Joined-up thinking is crucially important and goes back to the very first question asked.  All our speakers have indicated that.  Teagasc is considered a leading organisation in agricultural research.  However, it seems to be more <i>ad hoc<\/i>when it comes to agricultural education.  Teagasc colleges have links to many other local third level institutions and courses but it appears this is a result of arrangements made locally.  Is there scope for a more co-ordinated approach?  Last year we heard reports that agriculture science teachers at second level were at odds with the Department of Education on the new leaving certificate course.  Did Teagasc have any input into those second level courses?  Would it be fair to say that more can be done to improve joined-up thinking across Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#J00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>The funding for the Covid supports came from within the Teagasc budget.  Last year, there were some savings as the year went on because activities were not normal.  All the funding measures we had for Covid supports were sanctioned and approved by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but they came from within the actual Teagasc budget and were approved by the Department.<\/p> <p>  Regarding demand, the strong area of demand has been for those adult green cert programmes, particularly in the north-west part of the country.  We have had good support from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine over the last number of years.  Since 2014 a total of about 117 temporary education officer posts were sanctioned, with 20 approved earlier this year.  They have helped boost our intake substantially in recent years.  It would be very difficult for us to operate, plan and maintain a high level of intake without that level of ongoing support.  This year we hope to enrol 1,500 or maybe somewhat more in those part-time distance education courses.<\/p><p>We will also be enrolling people in our full-time courses and across our higher education courses.  In terms of gross enrolments, we are probably enrolling 2,500 students per year across various programmes.  It is challenging in parts of the country and we need the temporary education officer support to provide that.<\/p><p> Demand in certain areas may be somewhat ahead of capacity.  That is why we use the temporary education officer model to allocate resources on a flexible basis.  Of the 20 education officers we are appointing this year, 15 will go to the north west, six to Donegal, four to Ballyhaise College, two in the north east and two in Mayo.  As there was particular demand, we are trying to shift and match the resources all across that area.  We also maintain our permanent education officer numbers to reflect demand in those regions, meaning that it would be somewhat higher than in other areas.<\/p><p> The ETBs are approved separately to run programmes by QQI.  Teagasc has no role in that.  It is a separate activity.  There are areas between Teagasc and the ETBs such as learner supports and areas within courses.  Teagasc has the strongest expertise in actual agricultural production and the financial aspects of it.  There are personal development modules which we and ETBs could work together to deliver.  There have been some arrangements locally in that regard.<\/p><p> On the second level agricultural science course, we do not have a direct input into it.  We were involved in some of the earlier consultations.  Our main remit is to help the students and teachers.  For example, in projects, we can give them a steer, resources and information as how they might develop projects for fifth year and sixth year students.<\/p><p> We sit outside the National Training Fund.  As apprenticeships are funded through the National Training Fund, Teagasc would be eligible to access that money.  In terms of other schemes, such as skills to advance, we sit outside of that.  If the ETBs were able to draw down funding for research from the National Training Fund and Teagasc was outside of it, there would probably be some disparity and that we would have a level playing field in that regard.  Overall, with ETBs and some private providers, there is probably a need for some joined-up thinking in terms of industry and agricultural education training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Pettit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Ring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#K00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Can the Chairman hear me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#K00300","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#K00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Or Cathaoirleach, as the new title is now.<\/p> <p>  I welcome our guests.  Agriculture is gone very high-tech.  There are a number of sectors in the agriculture game.  There are people who are high-tech and full-time farmers.  There are those, like we have in the west, who are in farming on a part-time basis.<\/p> <p>  One has people putting their names for courses hoping that they will be called for them.  In another case, the green certificate might be essential for a farmer to draw down grants.  There was a big furore in my area this year because there was such a demand for green certificate courses.  I heard Mr. Pettit say Teagasc will be allocating extra resources to the west and north west, which is important.  When the Department is making the rules on how people can draw down payments, does Teagasc have any input?  Can it say it is not in a position to give the farmers the courses they need?<\/p> <p>  I have great respect for Teagasc, which has been ahead of the game over the years.  Farming and the whole science of agriculture are changing.  At the same time, there is a module of farmers out there who will never change.  What they need is support, help and back-up from Teagasc and other groups.  These are farmers who are not in it on a full-time basis but just about struggling to make a living out of it.  They are finding the rules and regulations, along with the educational needs, difficult.  Has Teagasc any proposals or support for these kinds of people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#K00500","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>We are allocating the bulk of the green certificates to the education officers that we got towards the north west.  It is an area of demand across the north west and the north east.<\/p> <p>  The education needs of farmers are changing and increasing.  There are different categories of farmers and different levels of programmes and courses.  On the green certificate, people complete a level 5 certificate in agriculture and a level 6 specific purpose in farming.  People who may be going back into a more full-time and commercial level of farming are not required to go beyond that.  We would recommend, however, that they would take the level 6 advanced certificate and certainly look at the apprenticeship groups when they come on stream.  We accept that not every farmer is going beyond the minimal requirement for schemes.  It is advisable that some would take up further courses in terms of the nature of their farming, however.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Revenue own the schemes and incentives directed at young farmers.  As such, we do not directly influence those, other than that we would be feeding back to the Department in terms of likely demand scenarios.  We would be indicating where we see pressure points arising in terms of demand, the need for us to put on more courses and hire more staff.  The Department has accommodated Teagasc in that regard.

We put those together within the organisation because we very much see the interaction with the farmers as a continuum of those two services.  More and more, they are overlapping.  One does not have a farmer coming through a course who suddenly becomes educated and then advice is all they need.  Ongoing training and facilitation are needed as well.<\/p> <p>  A point was made that some farmers are struggling with rules and regulations, as well as ensuring they are meeting all the requirements and paperwork of various schemes.  An ongoing challenge for our advisory service is to be sufficiently resourced in terms of being able to help the farmers who require support from us.  We must also balance this with full-time high-tech farmers who have development needs in terms of their businesses and farm development opportunities.  It is quite a range for our advisers to span but that is what we continue to try to do as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  For the high-tech end, we are developing the area of continuous professional development for farmers.  Mr. Pettit mentioned the education vision programme.  One of its recommendations was that education does not stop when one walks out of the college or when one graduates with a green certificate.  It is an ongoing process, particularly with the challenges in the sector between sustainability and climate.  Being able to reach and help farmers in terms of the evolving requirements of all that is something on which we are keen.<\/p><p>We are launching a programme in Teagasc called the Evolve programme geared towards helping and reaching farmers by recognising the farmers who participate and engage in those types of development, training exercises and activities in that they can record and get credit for that.

I want to talk to them about the farm discussion group model and how it is working out.  Obviously, last year, there were issues regarding Covid-19 and farm discussion groups.  It is great to see they reverted to Zoom and other mediums.  Has Teagasc started back on the practical footing of having those discussion groups at farm level?  Has it put a working programme in place to tie all them together?<\/p> <p>  The model is successful and proactive.  There are 12 meetings monthly, with a different farmer every month, an exchange of knowledge and knowledge transfer on a practical level.  It is probably even getting at a cohort of farmers from a different generation.  It has worked exceptionally well.  Where does Teagasc see that going over the next two or three months, in particular?  When will it start in the fields?  What is the future of that programme?

The farm discussion group model has been an evolving innovation within the delivery of knowledge transfer over the past 30 or 40 years but, certainly, huge advances have been made in the past ten years.  Teagasc has embraced it thoroughly, in that our approach to advisory services is towards group delivery models.  That has advantages from the point of view of delivery.  One can reach more farmers with information quicker and faster, when one can group them together.  The studies done on discussion group participation are positive, from the point of view of what the farmers get out of it, compared to less contact on a one-to-one basis.<\/p> <p>  There is a balance to be struck between one-to-one advisory contact and discussion groups.  That personal level of contact is still important.  That is something we need to continue to be able to deliver successfully.  From a farmer's perspective, that group interaction is significant from the point of view of the peer-to-peer learning in which farmers can share in each other's experiences and even the social aspects, given the way society has gone, especially pre-Covid-19.  We are probably less isolated when more people are working at home due to Covid-19.  Previous to that, the social aspect was recognised as being important as well.<\/p> <p>  As expected, when Covid-19 arrived, everything went online.  Suddenly, these discussion groups had to cope with how to use various software and technologies, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams and so on, to engage.  We successfully kept groups going in that context.  Towards the middle of last year as the restrictions eased, we were back doing many face-to-face meetings, which returned online for the early part of this year.  However, we are starting to organise face-to-face discussion group meetings again.<\/p> <p>  Well-established groups in which the farmers know one another well are probably less vulnerable, but we are conscious of groups at the earlier stage of their development, in terms of the social cohesion within the group and familiarity between the farmers.  Those groups are more strained when they are trying to depend completely on online delivery.  However, we now have farmers who are better trained and more open-minded to the online engagement.  Some discussion topics lend themselves adequately and quite well to online delivery models.<\/p> <p>  There have been some innovations.  I have noticed some advisers, in trying to keep to the approach to discussion groups fresh through the virtual delivery, are changing aspects such as the timing of the group meetings to make them shorter, snappier and more frequent.  There have been involving innovations, in agreement with and under the direction of, the groups involved in terms of trying to keep them fresh and alive.<\/p> <p>  In the future, there is probably scope for a blended approach in which there is a mix and match of both.  The face-to-face and social aspects of it are important as well.  It is relevant that knowledge transfer, KT, groups were supported in the previous round of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  There are opportunities for that to be supported again.  The scope of the group is not just about group meetings.  It is also about other aspects of group activities, whether it is shared experiences of technology usage or, particularly, the social aspects of groups such as trips away to broaden the everyday experience of the farmer.  We see those aspects coming through loud and clear in the effective way the groups continue to be relevant in terms of a knowledge transfer.  They will continue in our programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021052500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stan Lalor"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>As no members are indicating that they have questions, I thank our two witnesses from Teagasc, Dr. Stan Lalor and Mr. Tony Pettit, for their contributions to the meeting today and the way they answered the questions.

At the end of this presentation, we would be happy to answer any questions the committee might have.  If we are unable to provide answers today, I will arrange for the relevant information to be sent in writing to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The EAI is the trade association for the electricity industry on the island of Ireland.  We represent over 90% of electricity generation and retail supply activities, and 100% of distribution.  Our members have a significant presence across the sector value chain.  We represent the interests of the all-island electricity market in Ireland, the UK and the EU, through membership of the European electricity sectoral representative body, Eurelectric. <\/p> <p>  Our vision is for a decarbonised future, powered by electricity.  Our sector supports the Government&rsquo;s ambition for a carbon-neutral economy.  As stated by the Climate Change Advisory Council, the continued decarbonisation of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity sector is of fundamental importance to achieving climate action targets, as this is the foundation of decarbonisation in many sectors. <\/p> <p>  There is no other energy carrier that can curb greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions in transport and heating sectors to the same extent and scale as electricity.  As part of our commitment to achieving our vision, the EAI commissioned the centre for Marine Research and Innovation, MaREI, to model the electricity system in 2030, under the base assumption that 70% of the 50 TWh of electricity consumed on the island will be generated by renewable energy sources.  The resultant report, Our Zero e-Mission Future, which was circulated to this committee previously, demonstrates unequivocally that a 70% ambition for renewables in 2030 is achievable on an all-island basis.  However, it will require significant investment in the all-Ireland grid and an accelerated electrification of heating and transport to place Ireland firmly on the path to net zero emissions. <\/p> <p>  The MaREI researchers used publicly available data, stated Government ambition and independent modelling to project into the future.  Uniquely, they examined a quarter of a million hours of historical weather data.  This allowed them to determine the extremes that the future weather-dependent, electricity generation system on the island of Ireland will have to flex to.<\/p><p>They found that by the end of the decade, the island&rsquo;s electricity system will be 40% larger in capacity but will emit half the emissions of today.  This will require all planned electricity interconnectors - including North-South, from the Republic of Ireland to the UK and from the Republic of Ireland to France - to be in place by 2030.  However, backup generation fuelled by natural gas will be used less.  The findings will have implications for the economics of existing and new investments.<\/p><p> The analysis of the weather data shows the importance of being able to export and import energy through the interconnectors during high and low wind periods.  During conditions where electricity demand is high but weather-dependent generation is low, we will need all storage and system flexibility to be maximised and all backup generation, including natural gas, to be available.<\/p><p> The study looks at potential pathways to net zero.  It includes the 5 GW of additional wind energy to the climate action plan that is in the programme for Government and highlights the need for increased interconnection.  After 2030 there is implicit uncertainty about the most appropriate low-carbon technologies and energy sources.  Large storage projects, carbon capture and storage, interconnection or power to hydrogen all share a requirement for early investment decisions, significant capital commitment and long lead times for construction.<\/p><p> With one year gone and nine to go to 2030, it is imperative that the Oireachtas turns its attention to ensuring that the correct policy signals stimulate appropriate market incentives and the right investments for a cost-effective and just transition.  Ireland has already achieved world-leading rates of renewable penetration for weather dependent energy on an isolated island system.  There is now a significant opportunity to crystallise a leadership role in the energy transition.  However, this will require a much faster rate of switching from high carbon fossil fuel to electric heat pumps and vehicles and a much more flexible and agile electricity grid to absorb the projected level of weather-dependent generation.  An all-island approach to market development and infrastructural investment will be required too.<\/p><p> This report is a postcard from the future and sets out the challenge we face of swapping the petrol in our cars and the kerosene in our boilers for plugs.  We must also co-ordinate policy, planning and investment to facilitate the increasing levels of electricity generated renewably.  Ultimately, it will be this renewable electricity that will be relied upon to fuel the backup zero carbon emission generation of the future.  The time to invest in our all-island electricity system is now and is a no-regrets decision from which future generations will benefit.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to give evidence to the inquiry.

By being on the grid they reduce costs across the grid for everybody else.<\/p> <p>  Currently much of the energy for some of these big companies is green electricity procured through corporate power purchase agreements separate from main contracting or auctions held for wider electricity.  It is hard to predict and we are not an expert body when it comes to projections.  We rely very much on what EirGrid indicates in this regard.  We live in an organic system when it comes to electricity and it is a chicken and egg scenario.

That is because there is such a large requirement for backup generation and storage that the storage in itself could potentially provide a significant amount of system services.

It also assumes the Celtic and Greenlink interconnectors will be operational.  It is an absolute necessity that they are.

To some extent, that is why they have come to Ireland.  How does that impact on the system?

On delivery, our study projected beyond 70% because even as a study is written, things move on and it becomes out of date almost the minute it is written.  Of course, within the programme for Government a number of additional ambitions were put in place.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether electricity can up its game to deliver beyond that 70%.  The answer is \"Yes\".  Our study looked at some of the ways we would do this.  An extra 5 GW of offshore, indicated in the beyond carbon action plan in the programme for Government, would lead to an extra 1.3 million tonnes, but that would again rely heavily on batteries.  In the scenario presented in our study, battery usage would increase battery storage to 2.4 GW.  <\/p> <p>  Additional interconnection would also be needed beyond the Celtic, Greenlink and North-South interconnectors, and it would be necessary to rely on at least one of the gas plants having some form of carbon capture and storage.  That is not to say anything about the operations of the grid.  At that point, one would have to reduce.  Currently, the requirement is for six generation plants to be on minimum generation.  That would need to drop below four and approach zero, which means relying on certain system services from technology not currently available.  <\/p> <p>  The answer is \"Yes, this can be done\", but there are challenges around operating a system beyond 70% and delivering 5 GW of wind, in addition to developing 2.4 GW of battery storage, additional interconnection and post-2030 technology such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.  Our study states this is not possible by 2030, but beyond 2030 is where the next bit needs to happen.<\/p> <p>  Regarding microgeneration, again, as part of the final design we are waiting for what the Department and regulator will set out on remuneration.  It was expected the July deadline would be met but given the timeline suppliers will need to bring in a microgeneration scheme for their customers, it is doubtful it will be.<\/p><p>However, we await word from the Department on that.  <\/p><p> In terms of the signals, at the moment, in terms of market design, we rely on a number of remuneration mechanisms, whether that be through system services for energy itself or for a capacity market.  Things are going to change fairly radically out to 2030.  Current facilities and energy generation on the system will be used a lot less.  We will have far more renewables on the system.  Our view is that the regulator has to look at all of these remuneration mechanisms to ensure the right mix of generation is on the system in 2030, relates to each other, is very much integrated on the system and attracts the level of investment necessary to ensure we have a very reliable and safe electricity system.  Given some of the amber alerts we have had this summer, I believe the regulator is going to run what is known as a T minus 3 option to secure additional capacity in generation in the next few years.

I was very interested in Mr. Lynott's comments about data centres and how the increased number of data centres might actually help as we become more ambitious in renewable energy penetration across our grid.  Could Mr. Lynott elaborate on that?  I am interested in the geographic distribution of data centres.  Does that help?<\/p><p>I was very glad to see hydrogen touched on in the association's report.  We put ambitious language on hydrogen into the programme for Government.  It is quite interesting to see in the past few months in particular a big move globally as well as in Ireland.  There are some very significant moves towards developing the hydrogen economy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was down in Cork this morning looking at the planning of an electrolyser project down there.  It is very exciting.  The witnesses mentioned earlier that no sooner is a report published than it becomes out of date.  I am interested in the association's modelling around hydrogen.  It seems as though the technological challenge is not there so much and it is very much becoming a regulatory and economic one as opposed to a technical one.  <\/p><p>The witnesses mentioned storage and the need for it in 2030 in terms of battery technology on the grid.  I am interested in microstorage and the potential for electric vehicles as we significantly increase the number of electric vehicles in our transport fleet in order that these can provide the storage and essentially the buffer for those periods of fluctuating renewable generation.  Could Mr. Lynott speak to that?  Is it a realistic prospect that our private vehicle fleet could essentially bolster and support greatly increased renewable energy generation?  <\/p><p>A German term was used in the report provided.  I think it was <i>kalte Dunkelflaute.  <\/i>My German is not so good so I hope I pronounced it correctly.  It means the cold dark doldrums.

I am interested in the association's modelling around that.  Could Mr. Lynott speak more to that modelling piece done by the association?  Will we need particular generation just for those periods?  Perhaps that is as much an economic question as it is a technical one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021052500002#D00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Data centres take up about 9% of demand and are projected to grow by between 19% and 50% over the next decade reaching an expected 27% of electricity demand, so they are a very big player within electricity demand.  The difficulty and opportunity are that they require high availability.  There is a possible flexibility in terms of either storage they provide to the system or their backup generation may make provision for system services.  This is something that is being actively pursued by EirGrid in its discussions with data centres.<br\/><br\/>Regarding geographic possibility in the recent consultation on the future of our electricity system by EirGrid, it has indicated that one of the potential routes is shifting demand to where electricity is being generated.  The potential is then to shift data centres closer to concentrations of electricity generation that would minimise the amount of grid that needs to be developed to bring power to the centre of data centres, which is around the Dublin area.  Again, this is very much into the future.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding storage, the hope is that the advent of significant numbers of electric vehicles and smart metering will allow some of the technology or at least the smart technology to pass through a smart meter and potentially provide for system services.  This is envisaged within the clean energy package but, again, we are waiting for the legislation and the regulatory framework that would allow this to happen.  There is a challenge.  The Chairman mentioned the <i>Dunkelflaute<\/i>.<\/p><p>A two-week period was modelled using the pan-European proprietary PLEXOS model, which includes the UK and EEA countries and has the ability to take on board weather data.  The modelling indicated that, in such periods in 2030, all available generation capacity from gas will be needed, all interconnections will be needed and 1.1 GW of storage will be needed, which is not available on the system currently.  The volume of storage is the difficulty.  Our study cited an example.  In a two-week window of low wind speeds, and assuming 13.5 kWh per unit, the equivalent of approximately 65 million Tesla Powerwalls would be required.  Obviously, we are not at that level of technology.  Long-duration storage technologies could provide some of the solutions.  By that, I mean pumped hydro, of which Turlough Hill is an example, compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage using liquid salt or hot rocks, liquid air energy storage and novel battery compositions.  Some of the projects in this category are in Silvermines, County Tipperary and compressed air energy storage in Islandmagee, County Antrim.  They are the types of storage that could provide backup to address the <i>Dunkelflaute<\/i>.  There is a great deal being done in terms of battery storage, with much storage coming on the system.  There is a call for many hybrid systems in the future, combining renewables with storage on the same site.  I have already mentioned data centres, which might be able to provide some storage and system services.  The private vehicle fleet forms part of the package of materials around storage.  Reverting to my point about 65 million Tesla Powerwalls, though, will it have the impact that is needed to back up an electricity generation system that is 40% larger than it is currently?<br\/><br\/>Regarding hydrogen, it is important to stress that, because the Electricity Association of Ireland represents the entire value chain, we are technology neutral.  Our study considered what potential technologies could be used in 2030 to ensure backup generation, which is currently being provided by something else.  The two significant runners in that race are hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.  Along with issues of interconnection and battery storage, the difficulty is that these are expensive and complex capital projects that require a great deal of planning and lead-in time.  Therefore, we believe that the focus needs to be on undertaking a cost-benefit analysis and proper assessment of the technology that will be needed on an all-island basis to provide backup generation.  Hydrogen is definitely one such technology.  Throughout Europe, there is considerable investment in the use of green hydrogen through electrolysers.  Europe would say that, in the first instance, hydrogen could be used as a fuel for the hard-to-electrify sectors, including aviation, maritime, heavy transport and some large industries that are currently using fossil fuels.  Hydrogen also provides a system service potential in terms of storage, in that it could become a fuel during a <i>Dunkelflaute<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>These decisions can only be made if we assess them correctly, pick the right winners for Ireland and back this up with legislation and regulation that invite the private sector to come forward with solutions that support Ireland's renewables ambitions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021052500002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Lynott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynott for his answers.

If we do not switch from petrol in our cars and kerosene in our heating systems to plugs, there will be no demand for the electricity we are generating.

Eurelectric, the European representative organisation, has stated that we need to decrease our overall energy usage per year by 1.5% and increase electrification by 1%.  Energy efficiency forms part of demand management.  Our members that are suppliers will play a role in that through the energy efficiency obligation scheme of which they are a part.

Like the Deputy, I heard the announcement and I have the same information as him.  I believe it intends to shut down generation there but to have it as a potential backup for a number of years.  As to what extent and the detail of it, unfortunately I am not able to give the Deputy information on this.  It would have to come from the ESB.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, there is no doubt that the vast bulk of the 40% increase in generation will come from wind according to our study.  It will double in size from 5.5 GW capacity at present to 11.6 GW capacity.  The amount of gas plant on the system will be roughly the same with regard to capacity but the number of hours will be far fewer.<\/p> <p>  If the interconnectors do not happen, there will be a real difficulty in managing the system.  Our study assumes the Celtic, Greenlink and North-South interconnectors will be up and running.  With regard to the timeframes, as is the committee we are very much reliant on EirGrid for these.  The assumption is if they are available before 2030, they will be operational in 2030.  Again, there is a huge caveat in our study, which is whether we can reach the ambition of electricity demand for electric vehicles and electric heat pumps and whether we can develop the types of storage technology needed.  In the PLEXOS study, to maintain dispatch down at 7%, which is seen as an average by the industry, the gap has to be plugged with 1.1 GW of storage.  I do not think our study is certain.  It is a particular picture of the future, and like any picture of the future it is wrong almost before the print hits the page.  However, it shows the challenge that meeting 70% by 2030 will create for building grid, operating grid, new technologies, interconnection and shifting demand from fossil fuels to plugs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021052500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dara Lynott"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>In section 5.6, the EAI's  report speaks about minimum generation units.

Our study is a snapshot of the future.  It mentions 1.1 GW of battery storage.  If we are to minimise the dispatch down of renewables, we need that quantum of battery storage.  Already, I know that the auctions, regulators and EirGrid are seeking proposals for battery storage and are ramping that up.  With our study, we are trying to provide that snapshot of the future.  We want to highlight that it is all interconnected.  If we do not have the interconnectors, there will be a problem.  If we want to reduce dispatch down, we need batteries.  If we want to achieve the ambition, we need to build grid, be innovative about using it and we need to switch.  It is all interrelated.  It is very difficult to single out storage and argue that will be the solution at a particular time.  Like much of the work that is currently under way, we need to make decisions now in order that they are in place by 2030.  Battery development is one solution.  There are technologies available.  Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any long-term storage battery solutions out there beyond what I have already mentioned about the number of Tesla Powerwalls that will be needed.  Therefore, we must look at pumped-water and pumped-air storage.  Those are technologies that would allow for hours of storage as back-up for the <i>Dunkelflaute<\/i>.  Obviously, if there is widespread use of batteries along with generation, that will also dampen the peak demand and the backup that we would need.

I am focusing on some of the narrative in respect of the demand for energy.  When I was reading the presentations, I was a little concerned that there is still a lot of reference to reliance on hydrogen.  We are looking at a context in which the use of blue hydrogen in particular, may not be an option, because it is ultimately a fossil fuel.  In that context, we need to think very carefully.  I am concerned about assumptions being built-in.  As Mr. Lynott said, the ambition levels are rising all the time.  The balance in respect of the cap will also have to change.  I am conscious that the rationale behind the plan was related to that fact that energy demands are increasing.<\/p> <p>  I would like to comment on the increase in demand for energy.  That is something that needs to be looked at.  I would appreciate a comment on that.  We are talking about 30% to 40% increase in demand for energy.  We know, from meeting with representatives of EirGrid, that a large amount of that demand is from data centres.  We are going to come to a crunch point which is not simply about whether we can produce more renewable energy.  Everybody is on board with the idea of producing more renewable energy.  However, the question is, what are we going to do with that renewable energy?  If we are only increasing our renewable energy by 30%, 40%, 50% or 60%, but 30% of it is immediately going to data centres, we are forcing the State to use other sources of energy for essential services that it may need.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses think that we need to look at the prioritisation of the direction of sustainable energy?  I would appreciate comments from the witnesses on the narrative of the balancing of the developer-led and the State-led models.  When we talk about balance, there may well be State policies pushing development in certain directions, but there is also a wider State context, which is not something that gets balanced off against developer desires or anything else.  It is about the fact that, as is appropriate, the State needs to think about planning properly.  In respect of the marine protected areas, for example, the State needs to consider how to ensure that we plan in a way that is thoughtful and is going to dovetail rather than clash with that.<\/p><p>Again, these are all things that can be done.  However, I sometimes wonder when we hear this kind of talk about how there will be a little bit of planning and a little bit of State policy and little bit of developer-led but all of this will happen within a State regulatory framework, including a planning framework.  Comments on that would be really useful.<\/p><p> I echo much of what Deputy Alan Farrell has been saying about batteries because that seems to be the key area where we need to have research.  I would like if the EAI representatives could comment a little bit more about the pumped air and pumped water storage and how we can basically have what looks like best international environmental practice on that.  I ask because something we want to do as a committee is ensure our climate actions are done in a environmental best-practice way.  On that point, what of public-public partnerships?  Which states have been doing good research?  The same battles have been had everywhere, the same challenges are faced everywhere and something we cannot afford is that maybe one company gets a great solution but the State as a whole must be really ahead of the curve and looking to what other states are doing with storage infrastructure in order that everybody can make use of the best practice as it emerges.  I ask the EAI representatives to comment on public-public investment, public research specifically on that issue and public-public partnership between states around that research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021052500002#G00900","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>On demand, the 40% increase in demand comes from an EirGrid figure based on Government ambitions.  Part of that demand is going to be moving from about 20,000 electric vehicles, EVs, right now to over 1 million such vehicles which will need to be charged and moving from 45,000 heat pumps right now to 750,000 heat pumps in 2030.  As we move from petrol as a primary energy fuel to electricity, our electricity consumption goes up but our petrol goes down.  Consequently, it is not just demand for demand's sake, it is substituting heavy fossil fuel - kerosene in our heating tanks and petrol in our cars - over to electricity and then that electricity progressively decarbonising.  What our study said is that it is going to be a challenge but 70% renewables by 2030 is very doable, so that is very important.  Energy efficiency is in itself very important because this is not so much about growing the total energy pie but about growing the electricity portion of the energy pie, albeit with the pie getting reduced.  For example, in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, energy statistics, electricity takes up about 30% of the total energy used in Ireland, transport 35% and heat 33%, so of the total energy used in Ireland only 30% of that is used by electricity.  Therefore what is being done by growing the 40% demand in electricity is that the 30% is going to grow but heat and transport are going to shrink and the overall total pie, the idea is it must shrink in terms of energy efficiency.<\/p> <p>  On public to public partnerships, what the public service is doing on energy efficiency is very important and there are some significant targets that one of the biggest landowners in the State, namely, the State itself, must achieve and in achieving that through green procurement and through all the other things, it will bring in a lot more service providers, a lot more expertise and a lot more personnel, which are then available to the private sector where energy efficiency is concerned.  Indeed, our own energy obligations supply scheme, in which our members are involved, has achieved incredible amounts of energy efficiency.  Thus the demand for electricity should not be seen in isolation, it is growing at a time when the total primary energy must reduce and the public partnerships are involved there.<\/p> <p>  On the demand, obviously the data centres are there for an economic reason, they provide a lot of backup to other sectors of the economy and as they are a highly important part of the ecosystem of the information technology economy that is in Ireland.  I believe the IDA has a strategy on data centres and has made statements about their importance.  Again, earlier on in the discussion I talked about how, because such centres have an always-on requirement, they must have a backup requirement.  There are possibilities the backup they have can provide system services both for storage that may available to other parts of the system but also with waste heat.  In north Dublin I think we have seen examples where the waste heat of a data centre is being utilised to provided heat for residences, which will in itself reduce the amount that is there.<\/p> <p>  On storage we mentioned two storage modes, namely, pumped water in the Silvermines, County Tipperary, which is a potential solution and then pumped air in Islandmagee, County Antrim, which is another.  Again, they are the types of long-term storage that will be needed.  On the research that is there, obviously Ireland has been very successful with projects of common interest for large projects like this, in public funding terms.  Indeed, the Celtic interconnector was a recipient of significant amounts under the public projects of common interest.  There is a significant amount of research available through the European research funding for renewable heat projects and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, does a lot of research on climate and on that area as well.

The EAI representatives have heard from us the focus on batteries and storage.  I raise carbon capture.  Storage is our key priority because that is what allows us to move to renewable energy but I am aware there have been concerns around some of the carbon capture mechanisms.  They tend to become stranded assets because it can effectively be a way of prolonging unsustainable energy sources for a very long time and they can become something of a stranded asset or white elephant.

However, it would seem that when our study reviewed all the pathways to net zero, those two technologies seemed to be in all of those pathways.

Mr. Lynott may have some feedback to give us on that.

Our members as suppliers will play their part in assisting in terms of advice.  The energy efficiency obligation scheme was initiated in 2014 with an annual target at that point of 550 GW hours.  This was increased to 700 GW in 2018.  This is 700 GW hours every year.  This represents about 2.7% of electricity generation in that year, which gives an indication of how the demand can be reduced.  The mix of that energy efficiency was 75% non-residential, mostly in the commercial sector, while 20% was residential and 5% was in the fuel poor.  We are about to embark on the next level of energy efficiency according to the energy efficiency directive.  Now that a lot of the low-hanging fruit has been picked, those targets will become more difficult for suppliers to achieve but access to low and zero-cost finance will be very important for homeowners before they decide to do the deep retrofit.

Mr. Douglas touched on one part of it because I was going to ask about the community projects.  I do not know to what extent the association engages with community projects and sustainable energy communities, which are beginning to engage.  That is a positive measure.  Do the witnesses have a comment on that and on how the association is engaging with those projects or is connected with them?<\/p> <p>  I have a question that follows up on the retrofitting piece.  I believe retrofitting is one of the few remaining low-hanging fruits, if it were to be really scaled up and if we were to look at deep retrofitting.  Linked to that is looking at embodied energy.  In terms of our electricity, we are looking at it sector by sector.  We are looking at energy and we are going to look at construction.  One of the big things we are seeing now, certainly in the UK, is a focus on a very deep retrofitting of large-scale buildings and projects, whereby one might repurpose or add a storey or two to a building.  One uses the skeletal structure and, in that way, the overall energy cost of a building, rather than tearing it down and building a new renewable building.  The more energy efficient way in many cases is to adapt or change a building and build on the existing skeleton or sleeve, as I believe it is called.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  It is different from just retrofitting.  It is about almost remaking buildings while keeping as much embodied energy as possible.  That has been advanced a great deal in the UK and it will have to come into play more here when we start calculating emissions, not just in terms of future energy usage but also the energy cost of the construction process.<\/p> <p>  The other part I have a question on is the clean-up costs on stranded assets.  I know the witnesses cannot speak about the specific, as the association has a suite of members.  We have seen in other countries that some companies will stop functioning, some will reinvent themselves and some will amalgamate.  However, there have been concerns in other countries about the clean-up costs of that transition.  What mechanisms might be in place within the industry to ensure there is best practice in that context?  I am concerned that the State could be left with the mopping up of old elephant infrastructure.  Within that transition and within the witnesses' sector, we have seen a contradictory thing at European level where sometimes the same companies that are investing in renewable energy for electricity or whatever are also, at the same time, suing states in respect of old infrastructure that they own relating to fossil fuels.  It is the same parent company wearing two different hats, one from the past and one for the future.  That is a major concern with regard to the Energy Charter Treaty.  The concern is the extent to which the industry's previous investments and the protection of those could act as a brake on us moving to the green new deal and the future we need on a regulatory base.  Do the witnesses have comments on that?  I believe that it will require a sea change from the industry.<\/p> <p>  My last question is an ambitious one.  It is one I asked of the Minister with responsibility for the environment a year ago, and it is probably five to seven years away.  We have the National Oil Reserves Agency.  Can the witnesses envisage a point at which we will have a national electricity reserve agency, whereby we would have policies that would enable us to have a national electricity reserve in terms of that same infrastructure?  I know we are not there yet, but is it something to which the witnesses could see pathway at national or European level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021052500002#K00700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I will take the last question first.  I will ask Mr. Douglas to deal with the stranded assets or what we would call the forced exit from or entry into the system and how the market design tries to minimise stranded assets or at least unexpected exits from the market.<\/p> <p>  The difficult thing about electricity as opposed to oil or gas is that one cannot store it or can store only very little of it.  It has to be used pretty much instantaneously.  Therefore the nearest one could come to what one could call a security of supply is the project that is being developed by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  That went out to tender last December.  Tenders were finalised or came to a close in early December.  That is something that will point to whether we are robust enough.  In 2019, 56% of our electricity was generated from gas.  The gas comes from the UK and our own gas field, which is winding down.<\/p><p>We have come from a position where nearly 90% of our gas was imported.  <\/p><p> There is a fragility about being at the end of the line.  There is a fragility that is dependent on interconnections and whether we have the right number, if they are robust enough and whether we have the right mix of technologies that will allow us to be able to continue to have a resilient electricity sector.  I stated earlier that the TSO has one of the top records in the EU in respect of resilience and the number of minutes during which the electricity system drops in Ireland.  It is a European leader in that regard.  <\/p><p> While we do not have an electricity reserve agency, we do have security of supply.  We would like to see the work that is ongoing finalised as quickly as possible because that in itself might influence the way that we deal with the technologies into the future.<\/p><p> On the community side, the electricity sector is very supportive of community projects.  The RESS auctions allowed for those community projects to come on board.  A number of them did subscribe to that.  From an association point of view, we would like to see us achieving decarbonisation of the electricity system as quickly as possible.  We would not be fans of the idea of ring-fencing.  Rather, we would support any unused quota being used to ensure that whatever money is available through those auctions delivers the solution as cost-effectively and as quickly as possible.

I am not sure what research has been done in Ireland.  This research is relevant, not so much in respect of one-off houses but rather in respect of estates where there are similar houses that were all built at around the same time and to the same standard.  Research should be available on the life cycle cost and the entire carbon cost associated with substantially demolishing or renovating a building and a calculation being made as to whether it is the best option, as opposed to minimising the destruction of materials only to bring in brand new materials that have to be manufactured at a carbon cost.<\/p> <p>  The work has started.

I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place of which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin in order to participate in public meetings.

Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regard references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise and make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#B00100","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Reports 2018 and 2019: Discussion","time":1621897200,"counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#B00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO, was set up in 2018.

I am pleased to have the opportunity together with my deputy ombudsman, Ms MaryRose McGovern, to engage with them today in relation to the work of my office.<\/p> <p>  The Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman was established on 1 January 2018 under the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017.  It was established on the foot of a merger of the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman.  We provide a free, independent, impartial, confidential and fair service to resolve complaints through either informal mediation, leading to a potential settlement agreement between the parties, or formal investigation and adjudication, that leads to a legally binding decision.<\/p> <p>  When any consumer, whether an individual, a small business or an organisation, is unable to resolve a complaint or a dispute with a financial service or a pension provider, they can refer their complaint to us.  We deal with complaints informally at first by listening to both parties and engaging with them to facilitate a resolution that is acceptable to both parties.  Much of this informal agreement takes place by telephone.<\/p> <p>  Where these early interventions do not resolve the dispute, we formally investigate the complaint and issue a decision.  That decision is legally binding on both parties, subject only to an appeal to the High Court.<\/p> <p>  The Oireachtas has given me wide-ranging powers to deal with complaints against financial service providers.  I can look beyond the contractual terms and consider the fairness and reasonableness of the conduct complained of.  I can direct compensation of up to &euro;500,000.  I can also direct a provider to rectify the conduct that is the subject of the complaint.  There is no limit to the value of the rectification I can direct.  This could, for example, involve directing a financial service provider to reinstate a tracker mortgage interest rate and recalculate the mortgage account balance; to admit and assess an insurance claim for payment of benefit; or to reinstate an insurance policy that was wrongfully voided, and correct the record of that policy cancellation.  I can publish anonymised decisions and the names of any financial service provider that has had at least three complaints against it upheld, substantially upheld, or partially upheld during a year.<\/p> <p>  In dealing with complaints against pension providers, I can direct rectification.  However, this cannot exceed any actual loss of benefit under the pension scheme concerned.  For pension complaints I can publish case studies.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that certain aspects of our work, in particular the statutory time limits for making a complaint, can be complex for both consumers and providers.  If there is a time-limit issue or any other aspect that raises a question of eligibility for our service, we bring these matters to the parties' attention as soon as possible, and we offer guidance, where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  We inherited 3,178 complaints from our predecessor bodies.  In the three years to the end of December 2020, we received a further 16,362 complaints.<\/p><p>We closed a total of 15,205 complaints in those three years.  I am happy to report that in 2020, despite the challenges of the pandemic and remote working, we closed 6,193 complaints, which was an increase of 35% on 2019.<br\/><br\/>Mediation, by telephone and email and through meetings is the first and preferred option for resolving complaints.  By engaging with the parties directly, we facilitate them in exploring the possibilities of designing a resolution which they can both agree.  Where these early interventions do not resolve the dispute, we use our extensive powers to formally investigate in a fair and impartial manner.<br\/><br\/>Full details of how we managed complaints in any particular year are set out in our overview of complaints for that year<i>. <\/i>These documents include an analysis of all complaints made, a review of trends and patterns in the making of complaints and a breakdown of the method by which all complaints were dealt with during that year.  These overviews are available on our website for 2018, 2019 and 2020.<br\/><br\/>The beneficial impact of our office stretches way beyond the complaints with which we deal directly.  The mediations and investigations that we conduct produce fair, impartial and beneficial outcomes for the parties directly involved in the complaints with which we deal.  However, this is only part of the story.  There are many consumers who never make a complaint to my office, but who nevertheless benefit from our interventions and our work.  This was particularly evident in 2020, when more than 7,000 consumers received rectification or compensation on foot of a small number of my decisions.  This was because some financial service providers applied the directions from a number of my decisions in relation to tracker mortgage complaints to other customers in similar circumstances.  This is a practice I particularly welcome.  It has been publicly recorded that the value of the redress applied to such consumers exceeded &euro;300 million.<br\/><br\/>Of those who did bring complaints to my office, I am pleased to report that many had their complaints successfully resolved at various stages throughout the process.  For example, in 2020 a total of 1,867 complainants received compensation or redress or both or a settlement through our services.  This is an increase of 468 on 2019.  During 2020, the total sum of compensation or settlements that complainants benefitted from, through the various stages of our services in mediation, formal investigation and on-the-record offers made by providers, amounted to &euro;6,340,000.This does not include the very significant but unquantifiable benefits, in terms of redress by rectification, also secured by complainants.<br\/><br\/>Since the Oireachtas provided me with the power to publish my legally binding decisions, I have done so on five occasions.  Our online database of decisions now contains more than 1,000 legally binding decisions that have issued since the office was established in January 2018.  I believe that the publication of my decisions greatly helps to broaden the awareness of the role of this office and promotes a greater understanding of how we deal with complaints against financial service providers and pension providers.<br\/><br\/>I have also published five digests of decisions.  These digests contain short summaries or case studies of a selection of legally binding decisions.  Each of the digests and all published decisions are available on our website.<br\/><br\/>In March 2020, we began to receive the first complaints arising from the circumstances surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic.  To date, we have received 784 complaints where the complainant has identified Covid-19 as an element of their complaint, 536 of which have already been concluded, mainly through mediated settlements and the issuing of legally binding decisions.<br\/><br\/>We implemented measures from the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, in anticipation of additional complaints that would be received.  These measures included early identification and analysis of complaints with a Covid-19 element, engagement with complainants at an early stage to provide clarity on the steps required to process complaints quickly, the allocation of temporary resources to clear existing complaints in preparation for a potential surge and executive oversight, on a regular basis, of complaint trends.  In the context of the broader consumer landscape, we have had, and continue to have, considerable engagement and information sharing with the Central Bank of Ireland in relation to Covid-19 related complaints.<br\/><br\/>We prioritised the progression of complaints concerning business interruption insurance claims, in recognition of the importance to policyholders of achieving a swift understanding as to whether they were entitled to benefit under their policy of insurance.  This included early engagement with providers to obtain final responses.  We also use specialist teams to deal with Covid-related complaints.  To date, since March 2020, within the figures previously mentioned, we have received 162 complaints concerning business interruption.  I am happy to advise the members that 89 of these business interruption complaints have already been concluded, 24 of which were closed with a legally binding decision.  I am also pleased to report that some insurers have accepted our approach to these business interruption complaints, in the same way that providers have accepted decisions on tracker mortgage complaints, and have chosen to apply that approach and directions made in our legally binding decisions to other similar complaints, thereby facilitating a significant number of settlements.  This is most welcome.<br\/><br\/>As the members will be aware, in August 2020 FBD Insurance plc brought a challenge to the High Court seeking to prevent me from progressing the investigation of a business interruption insurance complaint.  I want to make clear that I will strenuously oppose any attempt by any financial service provider or pension provider to restrain me in the exercise of my statutory powers to investigate a complaint pursuant to the provisions of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017.  For that reason, we vigorously opposed this court action and in February 2021, FBD withdrew the challenge and the High Court struck out the proceedings, noting the agreement of FBD to discharge certain legal costs.<br\/><br\/>Complaints identified as tracker mortgage interest rate-related complaints continue to comprise a considerable element of the work of my office.  We inherited more than 600 tracker-related complaints from the Financial Services Ombudsman in January 2018 and we received a further 1,700 tracker mortgage complaints between 2018 and 2020.  In addition, a number of tracker mortgage complaint files were reopened.  <br\/><br\/>Since 2018 we have closed more than 1,200 tracker mortgage complaints.  Again, these were mainly closed through mediated settlements and the issuing of legally binding decisions, following formal investigation.  The tracker mortgage examination directed by the Central Bank of Ireland has resolved a large number of tracker mortgage complaints.  For those whose complaints were not resolved through the examination, it is important to understand that my work is an entirely different process which involves the scrutiny and consideration of individual mortgage arrangements to assess the merits of a complaint on the basis of its own individual circumstances.  A number of my decisions have resulted in borrowers having tracker mortgage interest rates restored.  In addition, as I have already mentioned, some of my decisions in relation to tracker mortgage complaints were applied to other customers, including customers who had not made a complaint to my office, resulting in a benefit to over 7,000 mortgage holders.  One bank appealed to the High Court, seeking to strike down a tracker mortgage decision I issued in April 2020.  In that decision, in addition to the payment of compensation, I directed the bank to reinstate the complainants&rsquo; tracker mortgage interest rate and to arrange for the recalculation of the mortgage account balance to take account of the different rate which should have applied over the relevant period.  The High Court delivered its judgment in February 2021.  The bank was refused the reliefs it had sought and was unsuccessful in all arguments.  Therefore, my legally binding decision stands and the bank is required to implement the steps I had directed.<br\/><br\/>As we continue to receive tracker mortgage complaints, such complaints will continue to comprise a considerable element of the work of this office for some time to come.  We currently have more than 1,200 tracker mortgage complaints on hand.  In February 2020, I published a digest of decisions dealing specifically with tracker mortgage decisions.  This is available on our website.  As with Covid-19 related complaints, we are working in close co-operation with the Central Bank to ensure that any consumers who have been wrongly denied tracker mortgage rates, have them returned in the most efficient and effective way possible.<br\/><br\/>Our co-operation with the Central Bank stretches beyond specific topics and, more generally, we have been pleased to share our views and unique perspective with the Central Bank, in the context of its project to review the consumer protection code.  Our relationship with the Pensions Authority is similarly marked by close co-operation and positive interaction, recognising our individual roles in what is an evolving pension landscape.<br\/><br\/>The Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman plays a key role in the consumer protection framework of the country.  We are committed to fulfilling this role by providing a robust, independent and fair service to resolve disputes.  We are committed to constantly improving the quality of our service.  During 2020, we achieved considerable improvements in terms of the number of complaints dealt with and in the quality of our service.  To their great credit, our staff proved to be agile and committed in responding to the circumstances brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Productivity was not only maintained, but indeed was enhanced, in some instances.<\/p><p>We remain committed to playing our part in keeping our staff and customers safe and contributing to the overall aim of suppressing the virus, while at the same time ensuring the provision of a high-quality customer service.<\/p><p> I assure members that together with the deputy ombudsman, my management team and all my staff, I will continue to use the powers the Oireachtas has given me, in an impartial manner, to ensure a fair outcome in respect of complaints made to my office.  We will continue to play our part to deliver the broader consumer protection framework.<\/p><p> I thank members and the Chairman for the opportunity to engage with them today.  The deputy ombudsman and I are now happy to deal with any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Deering for that comprehensive opening statement.

The theme and objective set out in our first strategic plan, which was from 2018 until this year, was to enhance the customer experience.  Having brought in more than 3,000 complaints from the previous bodies, and knowing we were going to receive a significant number of between 4,000 to 5,000 complaints in 2018, we recognised that improving the quality and speed of the service was critical.<\/p> <p>  A key part of that strategic plan was a workforce plan and the identification of the resources we needed.  Over the years since 2018 and to 2021, we have increased the number of staff and we have certainly improved both the quality and speed of dealing with complaints.  We acknowledge that we have further to go on that journey.  In 2018, for example, we closed 4,443 complaints and in 2019, we closed 4,569.  As I mentioned, last year in 2020, we closed 6,139 complaints.  That was despite the pandemic and the move to remote working.  We dealt with 35% more complaints.  Across a range of measures, therefore, we have improved both the quality and speed of the service,<\/p> <p>  In terms of public awareness, again, I would say the answer is \"Yes\".  I mentioned that the Oireachtas gave me the power to publish my decisions in the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017.  That has been one of the more beneficial changes and is the ultimate in terms of transparency.  The decisions are published anonymised.  People can see the reasons, however, because those are detailed decisions.  The legally binding decisions we make are significant and go into much detail.  They first set out the complainant's case and then the provider's case followed by our analysis and the ultimate decision.  The fact that more than 1,000 of those are now published on the website has greatly enhanced awareness.  The media has given considerable coverage each time we have published them.<\/p> <p>  In addition to that, I also published a digest of decisions each time I published decisions.  We are conscious that the decisions themselves are quite detailed and lengthy.  These digests of decisions actually give people a summary, usually one page in length, of what the decision is about, with a link to go and look at the full decision if they are interested.<\/p> <p>  Our database can be searched by complaint type, product type, year, whether the complaint was upheld or a whole range of fields.  All this has brought greater awareness.  In addition to that, we have improved our website and intend to do much more in terms of improving it.  We have also produced information leaflets to better inform the public.<\/p> <p>  I apologise; what was the Chairman's third question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":297,"content":"<p>It was on procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#D00500","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I am sorry; I could not read my own writing.  When a complaint comes into our office, the first thing we do is check to see if the complaint is actually complete.  Before making a complaint to our office, a person must make a complaint to the provider.  People sometimes arrive to us not having done so.  We have an explanatory leaflet with three steps that explains to people how to make a complaint to the provider.  They need to get a final response from the provider and we can then deal with the complaint at that stage.  We first engage with complainants to make sure they have been to their provider and have a final response, and ensure we have whatever we need to progress the complaint.<\/p> <p>  The complaint then goes to our dispute resolution process, which is a relatively new service we introduced.  In fact, it actually resolved almost 3,000 complaints last year and is a highly informal mediation process.  The first thing that will happen is a dispute resolution officer will pick up the phone to contact the complainant and try to establish exactly what the complaint is and what the complainant wants to resolve that complaint.  Then, the same complaint dispute resolution officer engages with the provider.  A kind of shuttle mediation takes place, although sometimes it is in person.  Much of this is done on the telephone, however.  We have sometimes described this as old-fashioned innovation because there has been a huge move online.  We ourselves made a big move online with many of our procedures in 2020.  We also acknowledge, however, that we have a cohort of customers who want to talk to somebody.  Sometimes, their complaint has evolved because of a lack of communication and because they could not get to talk to the right person.  We are, therefore, very conscious of that.  We want people to be able to communicate with us in whatever format works for them.  For many people, it is actually the telephone.  We are obviously using technology as well.<\/p> <p>  There are two ways in which a complaint can be resolved in dispute resolution.  Many complaints are resolved when the provider actually makes an offer and an agreement is drawn up between the parties.  It is entirely a matter for the complainant and the provider as to whether they want to come to an arrangement and make an agreement.  If they do, then that agreement is the basis of the settlement and the complaint closes.<\/p> <p>  In some instances, it is closed on the basis of clarification, whereby the complainant receives and accepts an explanation for whatever the conduct was and understands better what happened.  The complaint closes on that basis, with the ability to reopen it if something new comes to light.<\/p> <p>  If the complaint is not resolved at that level or at this stage of the dispute resolution service, it then moves on to our formal investigation service.  The first thing that happens is that an investigation officer will examine the file and prepare what is called a summary of complaint, which is issued to the provider.  It summarises the complaint and sets out a series of questions for the provider to answer and a schedule of evidence the provider must produce.  If they are not already on the file, this includes, for example, things like terms and conditions, all the communications, correspondence, records and recordings of telephone calls and so forth.  Very interestingly, at that stage, sometimes the providers actually come back with an offer, which the complainants are happy to accept.  Indeed, I believe more than &euro;1 million actually changed hands last year at that particular stage of the process.<\/p> <p>  If that does not happen then we progress with the investigation, which involves an exchange of documentation.  Coming back to the Chairman's earlier point about the speed of how we deal with complaints, we can see as we get into the process that a complaint handled in mediation will be resolved much quicker, usually within three months.  When it moves on to the investigation stage, it is a much more formal process.  The provider has the right to respond to the summary of complaint and the complainant then is entitled to make a submission in response to that.  We are, therefore, very much in the hands of the parties as regards how long it will take in a formal investigation because the submissions will go over and back.  In terms of fair procedures, we must allow the parties to make the submissions and provide whatever evidence they want.<\/p> <p>  When that process ends, we issue what is called a preliminary decision, which is, in a sense, in most cases, on the same lines and very similar to the legally binding decision.  We introduced this recently.  Before we did so, the first that complainants or the provider knew what the ombudsman was thinking was when they got a legally binding decision.  As the decisions are legally binding and only appealable to the High Court, we felt it would be good if people had an opportunity to comment on the preliminary decision before that step.  The preliminary decision, therefore, sets out the proposed decision but allows the parties to make certain further submissions on points of law or points of fact.<\/p><p>If there are no further submissions, the legally binding decision issues on the same terms as the preliminary decision.  If there are submissions, they are considered and a legally binding decision issues on the basis of all the evidence.  There are different stages along the process until it reaches its conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I have several more questions, after which I will bring in other members.  Will Mr. Deering explain the difference between the role of the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and that of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman?  Will he comment on resources and staff availability?  He pointed out that despite the impacts of the pandemic, his office has increased the number of complaints closed by 35% to 6,193.  His efforts and those of his staff in this regard are to be commended.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Deering also indicated that he inherited 3,000 complaints in 2018 and there has been an additional workload following on from the tracker mortgage issue.  He noted that while his office received 492 tracker cases during the year, it closed 582 cases.  That still leaves 1,200 cases on hand at the end of the year.  This indicates that while the office is making progress, there is a difficulty in getting through the build-up of cases.  A response that my colleague, Deputy Doherty, received to a parliamentary question earlier this year detailed that more than 4,600 complaints to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman remained unresolved, with some 2,865 of them having been submitted more than 12 months ago.  How many complaints in total are on the ombudsman's books at this time?<\/p> <p>  Finally, does the office have the resources and specialist staffing Mr. Deering feels are needed to get on top of its workload?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#E00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  The question on the difference between the role of the Central Bank and the CCPC and that of my office is a very good one because there is often confusion in this regard.  The simplest way I can describe it is that the Central Bank, as regulator, has overall responsibility for how financial services providers conduct themselves in terms of setting regulations and enforcing those regulations, whereas we deal with individual complaints and individual complainants.  How the tracker mortgage issue was handled is a good example of that.  In fact, I believe it was handled very well here compared with how we have seen some neighbouring countries handle such situations.  More than 40,000 people have got tracker mortgages back as a consequence of the tracker mortgage examination directed by the Central Bank.  From the figures we are talking about here today, we can see how long it would have taken us to get through those individual complaints.  What the Central Bank was able to do was deal with what it described as cohorts of customers.  Within those cohorts, there could be individual customers who may have a different set of circumstances and a particular contract, piece of correspondence or telephone call that did not apply to the other cohort of people but did apply to them individually.<\/p> <p>  We look and that is why it takes considerable resources for us to get through the number of complaints we deal with.  Once a complaint goes into a formal investigation, all of the correspondence must be examined.  We see individual complaints arriving in numbers of boxes of files and we have to go through years of information.  Particularly with tracker mortgage cases, we are going back, in some instances, to 2008 or 2006 and dealing with files and records of that vintage.  There is a lot of work involved in dealing with individual files.  That is the basic difference in terms of our role but the key point is that we co-operate very well with the Central Bank and the CCPC.  Similar to the Central Bank, the CCPC has an overall role in terms of competition.  The kind of things we do in terms of co-operation would be where we see an individual complaint and we have a concern that it might be a systemic issue or one that might apply to other customers, we will draw that to the attention of the Central Bank.  Likewise, if we find something we think is particularly egregious, we will bring it to the attention of the Central Bank.  The key difference is that the latter has an overall responsibility, while we can only deal with complaints we receive from individuals.  We have no power to do anything off our own bat.  That is as it should be.  The role of an ombudsman is to react and respond to complaints.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is correct in saying that we got an increase in resources.  Certainly, we increased the number of complaints we deal with.  We currently have 4,750 complaints on hand, which is down from the larger numbers that were previously there.  It is very difficult ever to have enough resources but we must acknowledge that we got an increase in resources and we are grateful for it.  The Chairman rightly points out that with things like Covid-related complaints and tracker mortgage complaints, which are quite complex, all the resources we have certainly are fully deployed.  We look at drawing down external resources if and when we can.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the age of the complaints on hand, we have complaints that are older than we would like and that have been with us for longer than we would like.  However, it is important to point out that a considerable number of the complaints that are with us longer have complex histories.  Sometimes, those complaints were closed but, due to a change in legislation to extend the time limits, for example, they were reopened.  The strict limits laid down in the legislation mean that if somebody wants to reopen a complaint, we allow it to be done because the person might otherwise lose the ability to progress the complaint on the basis that it is out of time.  The downside of that for us as an organisation is that it makes those complaints look very old.  There is sometimes a complaint that looks like it is six, seven or eight years old but, in fact , it may well have been closed five, six or seven years and then reopened a year or two ago.  Such complaints keep the same complaint reference.  We acknowledge that issue, however, and we are working hard to increase the speed of dealing with those complaints.  It will always be the case that the speediest resolution of complaints is through dispute resolution and mediation.  Ms McGovern will probably talk more about this point later but there have been decisions of the courts recently, particularly the Supreme Court, that make it very clear that quasi-judicial bodies like us are, in some sense, administering justice and must be very careful about having fair procedures and how they carry out those procedures.  It takes time to get that right.<\/p> <p>  I hope I have answered the Chairman's questions.  We are conscious that the tracker mortgage cases keep coming in and we are working hard to keep ahead of them.  I should point out as well that we are dealing with those complaints in the order in which we receive them, which means we must deal first with the older complaints before getting to the ones that have come in more recently.  It is important that I manage expectations in this regard.  While I have upheld complaints and directed that people be put back on tracker mortgages, and customers have benefited from that, there are some unrealistic expectations in this regard.  There are some people who feel they should have got a tracker mortgage simply because they would have liked to have one or they knew someone who got one.  It is important to point out that there must be a basis on which a person has an entitlement to a tracker mortgage.  Once a complaint is made, we will investigate it fully to establish whether the complainant has that right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Deering.

It is important to understand that the organisations making those services available do not require a banking licence and tend to operate under e-money licences.  It needs to be understood by the users of those services that right now, they cannot go to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman with a complaint because of the manner in which those firms are structured.  They do not have a physical presence here and they are not regulated by the Central Bank.  They are not subject to conduct of business rules for technical reasons but that is because the payment services regulations provide a protection that is over and above what the conduct of business rules would offer.  Anybody wishing to make a complaint, however, would need to go to the competent authority of the member state that issued the licence for those entities.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that it is in the public arena that at least one of those digital banking platforms has applied for authorisation in this jurisdiction.  If that authorisation becomes real, customers of those digital platforms will be entitled to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  <\/p> <p>  From the point of view of the Central Bank, it is probably or may be a concern that anybody holding an account with one of these entities can, in a matter of seconds, go from cash to crypto.  The Deputy referred to crypto.  It is important to understand that there is no specific regulatory regime in Ireland in terms of cryptocurrencies.  There is an argument that some elements of the e-money regulations or the payment services directive may play a part in cryptocurrencies but right now, they are not specifically regulated, so one is moving out of that consumer space into a non-consumer space.  It is a cause of concern.  Certainly in the past week or so, the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK has written to 300 firms warning them that they are failing to give appropriate warning to their customers about the risks of signing up to those services.  It is probably important to understand that cryptocurrencies are not necessarily for the average consumer.  They are very volatile.  Even in the past week or so, the Deputy may have heard of the Musk effect where Tesla has indicated an unwillingness to accept cryptocurrencies in exchange for - I will not say \"buy\" because I am not sure if that is the correct verb - for the acquisition of a vehicle.  This had the immediate effect of reducing the value of Bitcoin by 30%.  These are volatile assets.  It is a very dynamic and emerging landscape but right now, although the European Commission is looking at developing a regulation for markets in crypto-assets, it is not there yet.  It is only in its very early stages and what consumer protections it will offer remains to be seen.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>It is a fairly worrying that when there is no complaint mechanism, people may not be aware that they do not have a right to complain, which is very strange, particularly in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#G00300","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that the solution may not be too far off because Banking and Payments Federation Ireland is working with the pillar banks to develop an instant payment app that will provide an alternative for customers, who do not want to be bothered with IBANs.

The consumer protection code provides certain levels of information that is supposed to be provided to people.  The CCPC and the Central Bank have done a lot of work on switching codes and trying to encourage consumers to make themselves aware.  Unfortunately, there are two sides to this.  Very often the information is given to consumers and they do not necessarily always absorb it or they want to do a particular thing at a particular time.  We say it is absolutely incumbent and essential for a financial service provider to give consumers all the information in a very clear way but equally, the consumer needs to take that on board and consider, when they make these decisions, what the best course of action is for themselves.

The beauty of going last is that many of the questions I wanted to ask have been asked already.  Others have raised the banks that decide to leave the country, for whatever reason.  Why do the witnesses think Ireland seems to be so uncompetitive or undesirable a place for so many of these institutions to do business, whether it is insurers or banks?  Is it over-regulation, or whatever?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on Covid-related cases.  The FBD case was already mentioned.  I have been following that case and a number of publicans in the greater Cork area have a particular interest in it and were party to the case when it was taken some months ago.  At what stage is that case, in terms of the ombudsman's adjudication?  I suppose the witnesses must be very mindful of what they can or cannot say to us.<\/p> <p>  I have encountered cases in which people have alleged to me that they were refused mortgage protection by their banks because they tested positive for Covid during the pandemic.  Has the ombudsman dealt with any cases where mortgage protection has been denied in that context?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#H00600","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>On the last question, right from the outset in March 2020, we kept a very close eye on complaints where the complainants themselves identified Covid-19 as an element within the complaint and we very specifically tagged them so that we could see the trends that were emerging very quickly in order that we could hop on them, as it were.  The trends we saw from the outset were in the area of travel insurance.  I will return to the topic of business interruption insurance, on which the Deputy has touched.  We have not seen a surge of complaints on the banking side.  I am personally not aware of complaints to any large degree concerning Covid tests impacting on a person's ability to secure services.  On the Covid-related complaints that we have seen, and where we have seen significant elements emerging on the travel side, we have seen huge levels of engagement in the informal dispute resolution process that the ombudsman mentioned, which is our starting position.  We really do want to see financial service providers and their customers engage in a positive way in order that they can themselves design a solution with which they will both be happy, rather than having a solution imposed on them.<\/p> <p>  We did not see the same level of engagement on business interruption insurance at the outset, although that is beginning to improve.  The Deputy mentioned litigation commenced by FBD in the summer of 2020.  That was what we considered to be an unprecedented challenge to the work of this office, whereby the insurer sought to have us down tools on the investigation of a number of complaints.  To clarify, this was not a request that we keep going for the moment but hold our horses towards the end because some clarity was coming from the court; it was a specific challenge to the entitlement of this organisation to use the powers given to it under the Act to provide an alternative avenue of redress to a small business, including a publican, to come to this organisation to seek redress instead of going to court.  The argument put forward by the insurer was that because these issues were being litigated, the FSPO no longer had jurisdiction.  It was a very specific challenge that it was not a matter of discretion, the FSPO had no jurisdiction.  We considered that to be an unprecedented challenge.  Even if one compared it to the position taken by the banks, had a similar position been taken on the tracker mortgage situation, it would have been a significant hurdle to the work of the office.<\/p><p>While we certainly are aware that there has been plenty of litigation surrounding tracker mortgages, the two processes have been in a position to run parallel paths, as it were.  Certainly, this office has no interest in trespassing on the jurisdiction of the courts but the Oireachtas has given this office the powers to provide that alternative avenue of redress to individuals and small organisations that come within the definition of consumer.<\/p><p> We vehemently opposed that challenge to our entitlement to proceed with the investigation of a publican's complaint.  I am happy to state that that challenge to the court was withdrawn in February 2021.  The ombudsman touched on it in his opening statement.  The insurer agreed to pay certain costs in order to bring the matter to an end.  In the meantime, we had reached an accommodation in the interests of both parties that we would continue to work on those particular complaints but we would hold the issue of a preliminary decision until such time as the courts had delivered judgment in that test case with the four pubs that FBD was involved in.  I am happy to confirm that the complaints that were impacted by that litigation have been progressing and they are coming to a conclusion soon.<\/p><p> Overall, on the business interruption complaint side, as the ombudsman mentioned, we have put in place specialist teams.  We prioritised those complaints from the outset because we took the view that it was really important for policyholders to understand whether or not they were covered, and if they were not covered, to get that information quickly so that they could use that information to make the appropriate decision.  We recognise that some businesses might be teetering in a space where they were not entirely sure as to whether they should continue to struggle on, as it were, in anticipation of getting policy benefits.  From the outset, we prioritised the progress of those investigations and we were in a position to issue our first preliminary decision on a business interruption complaint in November 2020.  As the ombudsman mentioned, both parties have an opportunity after a preliminary decision has been issued to make further submissions.  The process on that particular complaint file continued for quite some time and has only more recently become a legally-binding decision.  We have a small number of legally-binding decisions issued.  We have 24 legally-binding decisions issued on business interruption complaints but we are pleased to see that where those complaints have been upheld, certain providers have adopted a positive approach to dealing with their policyholders who have other complaints and they have applied the approach that this office has taken in terms of those claims and the policy benefits payable and they have applied them across to their other customers.  We are also very much aware that the Central Bank has written to insurers to direct them to write to their customers who have not yet made a claim to point out that this is the outcome and that it is believed that they are covered if they wish to make a claim.  I do not know if that covers all of the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>In terms of the Deputy's question about the banks leaving and why we think that is the case, in honesty, we do not really know.

That was a recognition that it was taking longer than we had wanted for complaints to be dealt with.  Over the period of the three years, we have put in place specific key performance indicators, KPIs, to measure our performance in that area.  In 2019, as part of that process, we set a KPI of closing 6,000 complaints in 2020.  In March last year, as we saw all of our staff depart the office with a laptop under their arms, and we sent them a mobile phone afterwards, we worried that that KPI would not be achieved.  I am proud to say that the staff really rallied to the cause and we did actually achieve it.<\/p> <p>  How we have improved the service and what we laid out clearly in that strategic plan is that we would put in place measurable KPIs and regular measurement by that, by the senior management, as well as by the council.  There is the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Council and it is responsible for oversight of the operation of the office and the efficiency and the effectiveness of the office.  We went to the council in 2018 seeking additional resources to deal with some of the complaints that we knew we were taking too long to deal with.  The council gave us the additional resources but looked for what I would call challenging KPIs, as it was entitled and should do.  We came back with the challenging KPIs and we have actually managed to deliver on those.  There is no doubt but that the service is better and faster than it was.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on the next strategic plan, we will ramp up in the next strategic plan and evolve further.

The Deputy is correct, new providers have come in and been regulated here but he will recall that I mentioned FIN-NET, the network of European financial service ombudsmen.  We still communicate with the Financial Ombudsman Service, FOS, in the UK, but it is not under the umbrella of EU regulations, obviously.  There are situations, as I mentioned, where a contract might be governed by a different law.  In that instance, we would require the provider and the complainant to agree to have their complaint dealt with by this office under Irish law.  We cannot say it is definitely Brexit-related but more recently a financial service provider which, in the past would have agreed to have that complaint dealt with under Irish law, refused to do so and that created a problem.

This is another case where there is an advantage in putting our decisions on the website.  We regularly draw the attention of insurance companies to the need for clarity and clear communication when people take out an insurance policy.  We believe that some of the changes in the legislation will help that but we have been upholding decisions for some time where insurance companies do not ask a clear question.  For some strange reason, insurance companies have a habit of asking double negatives.  One sometimes see questions that say \"you, or any member of your family, have not had a claim in the last three years\", or \"you, or any member of your family, have not had a conviction\".  I will not go through the exercise here now, but when you start to ask people what the correct answer is to that, whether they have had a claim or conviction, there is a debate over whether the answer should be \"Yes\" or \"No\".  One should not have to debate or consider the question.  If an insurance company wants to know if a person has had a claim, it behoves it to ask the question \"have you had a claim in the last three years?\", not to make a statement \"you or any member of your family have not had a claim\" and expect the person to confirm or deny that statement.  We are very strong on pointing out to insurance companies that if they consider a question or piece of information important enough to not only refuse a claim but sometimes even to void a policy on the basis of an incorrect answer, then they really must ask that question correctly, clearly and in a way that makes it easy for the person proposing for a policy to understand the question.  It is an area in which we continue to see complaints.<\/p> <p>  I have pointed out numerous times to insurers in particular, and it is in my annual reports, that it is a very serious matter to cancel a person's insurance policy because in this country, if you have had an insurance policy cancelled, you will forever be asked a question on your next insurance, \"have you ever had a policy cancelled\".  In some instances, it can become almost impossible to take out insurance.  You could find yourself with a home that you cannot insure because of a dispute over how you answered a question in the past.  Equally, of course it is the responsibility of a person seeking to take out an insurance policy to answer the question correctly.  If the question is \"have you had a claim in the last three years\" and you have, then the answer must be \"Yes\", provided the question is asked in a clear manner.<\/p> <p>  On insurance premiums, we do not deal directly with increases in premiums ------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I might come in here.  We are very conscious of the work the Central Bank is doing on differential pricing.  It is doing a deep dive into the processes within organisations and the reasons behind that.  We have made a number of submissions to the Central Bank in the context of its work to review the consumer protection code in order to share our perspective on certain aspects.  Within those communications, we have suggested that the use of data analytics to calculate a premium is something that should be regulated.  It is obviously a matter for the Central Bank, as the regulator, to determine whether such a practice should be prohibited or whether it is permitted.  Similarly, if a loyalty penalty percentage is in place for customers who want to stay with a certain insurance provider, then perhaps there should be a limit on what that percentage should be and that should be communicated in a way that is clear in order that people can make an informed decision.<\/p><p>Going to back to the Chairman's question, we are very conscious when we see a complaint about premium rates that there are certain limits.  On the whole issue of commercial discretion and the European regulations regarding the calculation of premiums, there is a limit to what this organisation can do.  Nevertheless, when we see a complaint of that nature, we look to the detail that a complainant can make available to us in order to examine whether there are aspects of differential pricing behind the complaint about a premium increase or whether it is simply that the customer in question had an accident and his or her premium went up.  One of the key pieces of information is that every complaint is individual and will turn on its own set of circumstances.<\/p><p> If the Chairman would like details of the numbers of complaints received relating to premium increases, the best we could do would be to confirm that in writing.

Cases in which two people are joint owners of a bank account or insurance policy can be very difficult for the people concerned, the financial service provider and ourselves.  The difficulty we have is that if somebody has an entitlement to a bank account, we must get their permission in order to deal with a complaint.  I mentioned earlier the significant amount of evidence we have to collect in order to decide a complain.  That evidence can include bank statements and a lot of sensitive information that we obviously protect carefully.  We must have the consent of both parties to that account in order for that information to be submitted to this office.<\/p> <p>  It is important to stress that both parties to the bank account have equal rights and we have to respect and honour those rights.  We absolutely acknowledge and engage with people in this scenario.  We understand the difficulties and sensitivities that surround these issues.  However, it would not be possible for us to progress a complaint unless all of the owners of, and signatories and partners to, the bank account or insurance policy want this office to deal with the complaint.  If somebody does not want us to deal with a complaint and they are an owner of or have a part share in an account, we cannot deal with the complaint.  We are conscious of the stress and difficulty that can create for the other person.  We will work with the individual signatory and sometimes he or she manages to get the other person to agree to the progression of the complaint.  Individual signatories can progress the complaint as long as they have the permission of the other joint owner of the account or insurance policy.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman also asked a more general question about whether attitudes and culture have changed.  There is no doubt but that we have seen some change.  In the past, financial service providers did not engage at all in mediation.  We introduced the mediation a number of years ago and I am pleased to say, as I mentioned, that almost 3,000 complaints were resolved through mediation last year.  That means the provider willingly came to the table and listened to its own customer.  We constantly point out to financial service providers that the people with whom we are dealing are their customers.  We are trying to resolve a complaint that a financial service provider's customer has with it.  It is important that the bank or insurance company engages and listens to its customer.  The mediation has been successful and represents a sea change in attitudes and culture.  Has it gone far enough?  Not quite yet.  Do we meet resistance?  We absolutely do.  We have already outlined that cases sometimes go right up to the High Court.  We respect providers' right to appeal a decision to the High Court but the fact that we are appealed to the High Court shows there is resistance.  If anybody looks at some of our decisions, they will see significant post-preliminary decision submissions.  Those can be received from either party but it is certainly the case that some of the providers push back strongly against the preliminary decision and will make strong legal and other arguments as to why a complaint should not be upheld.  That is their entitlement but there are times when perhaps a different approach would be more helpful.  I called this out in the overview of last year.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned tracker mortgage complaints.  Where a complaint comes to this office and the complainant has been returned to their tracker mortgage but their dispute or complaint is about the amount of compensation they have received, we see, in some instances, banks going back into the argument as to whether the customer was entitled to a tracker mortgage or not.  That horse has bolted and that argument is over.  We are not dealing with that any more.  Those customers have been put onto the tracker mortgages to which they are entitled.  The discussion and consideration should now be around what was the detriment to that person.  I would like to see banks engage in more consideration of people's individual circumstances.  I explained earlier the ways in which the Central Bank deals with different cohorts of people.  As a part of that, those customers affected by the tracker mortgage issue received compensation that, in the vast majority of cases, was adequate.  However, within that cohort, there may be somebody for whom the loss of money over seven, eight or nine years had a profound impact because of his or her personal circumstances.  It is not always about the amount of money involved.  It is not necessarily the case that because one person lost more money than another that he or she is worse off.  It depends on the particular circumstances of the person in question.  I would like to see some of the banks pay more attention to the impact that their conduct had on the individuals when they are looking at complaints, rather than taking a sort of blanket approach whereby the banks say they have been through the examination and given the customer compensation, assess the complaints as too remote, conclude the customer did not suffer any inconvenience and is therefore not entitled to more compensation.  I would rather the banks looked at the impact of their conduct on an individual, given his or her particular circumstances, because that is how we look at a complaint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021052500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>It is unusual to find a lending institution that has feelings or empathy.

I am here on behalf of the Association of Childhood Professionals, ACP, a voluntary membership organisation representing practitioners in early years and school-age childcare.  As a professional association, all our members have a minimum of a level 5 qualification in early years.  This includes our members who are childminders.  I have been providing home-based early years and after-school care in my family home for the past 14 years.  I started childminding by providing a service to three preschool children.  With this number the regulations precluded me from registering with the HSE so, like many other childminders, I became a member of the professional childminders organisation, Childminding Ireland, and got childminding insurance, Garda vetting and paediatric first aid training.  I have done child protection training as well as voluntarily notifying my service with my local childcare committee.  In 2009, to enable my service to survive the introduction of the free preschool year, I registered with the HSE and opened my early childhood care and education, ECCE, preschool catering for six preschool children, which I still run in the heart of my home to this day.  I therefore feel I am well positioned to speak here about the difficulties of working with increased regulation, inspection and oversight within the home environment.<\/p> <p>  I have been asked to set out what I see as the strengths and challenges of the recently published national childminding action plan.  The strengths include a recognition that childminders are an integral part of the childcare landscape in Ireland and that childminders offer care to multi-age groups of children, as in family groups, preschool, schoolgoing children and after-school care.  They can all be catered for.  There is a recognition that low adult-child ratios and consistent caring in a family home setting offer positive well-being outcomes for children.  There is acknowledgement that childminders can offer a wrap-around childcare option that can be flexible and negotiable and, where possible, offers flexibility in respect of early, late, overnight and weekend arrangements.  The action plan builds on recommendations, experiences and expertise gathered from childminders, children, parents, childminding networks, organisations and county childcare committees.  Formal recognition is finally being given to the childminding sector, recognising that children, families and communities have benefited from the quality of care offered through the dedication and commitment of childminders who offer their childcare services.  Its approach is comprehensive, identifying core areas of implementation, namely regulations and inspection, training and support, funding and financial support, consultation and communication.<\/p> <p>  While I welcome the formal recognition the action plan gives to the central placement of childminding in the Irish childcare landscape, there are, in my view, certain challenges within the plan.  The timeframe for the full implementation of the plan is overly ambitious, considering that there are thousands of non-regulated childminders caring for children that have absolutely no idea that the regulation of childminding is rapidly approaching or that they will need to engage in accredited training and meet regulations and face inspections.  Serious investment in communication and consultation will have to be made to engage these childminders.  Connections were made with only a small percentage of working childminders, generally those who were already engaged with Tusla, Childminding Ireland and local county childcare committees.  These childminders are committed to raising professional standards in childcare and welcome appropriate regulation but their view may not be shared by many who see childminding as a short-term and more casual job.  I have concerns also that the Department sees the networking groups as being their main communication highway to reach out and contact or connect with many or all childminders.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned that experienced, knowledgeable childminders will be excluded from applying for childminding development officer positions due to not having level 8 degrees that are focused on centre-based rather than home-based care and education.  Childminders must be centrally involved in the development of a phased training and qualifications framework that identifies necessary training, desirable training and, finally, as childminding incrementally become increasingly professionalised, the qualifications that are needed or the \"icing on the cake\".  All training needs to be accredited and, to allow for professional and personal commitments, training should be broken down into smaller \"micro credentials\" that incrementally build to a full qualification.  We should note that increased regulation, administration, inspection, audits, etc., will result in a higher financial cost for childminders.  Significant State investment will be required to make sure that this increased cost does not mean that childminders can only operate by charging parents more.  We also need to be mindful that significant investment continues to be required for the development of centre-based provision, both early years and school-age.<\/p><p>The funding required to implement the action plan cannot be to the detriment of continued increased investment in the area of centre-based provision.<\/p><p> We also need to be mindful that small home- and centre-based services, subject to current regulations, standards, inspections and oversight, may lose out to childminders, who may be subject to less onerous inspections and regulations.<\/p><p> I thank committee members for listening and welcome their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ida Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation at a time when policy developments and structural changes will have a direct impact on the future of childminding in Ireland.  We have lodged a submission with the committee and, in the interests of time, I will present a truncated version.<\/p> <p>  Many on the committee or their family members will have had children minded by a childminder.  I ask members to picture that childminder.  How will the new policy and regulatory environment impact on them and how are their views being captured by the Government as it makes changes?<\/p> <p>  We all want an environment that supports healthy, happy, safeguarded and flourishing children, which is what quality childminders provide to the children in their care.  Childminding is a relationship-based, home-from-home form of childcare.  The same childminder will typically mind a child from babyhood, through to secondary school.<\/p> <p>  Childminding is different from centre-based or creche care in a number of important respects.  For example, childminding takes place in a family home and not a premises, childminders mind small numbers of children, spontaneity is possible and allows each childminding day to be child led and children belong there, rather than attend there.  <\/p> <p>  Childminding Ireland is the organisation fighting for childminding, founded by childminders and run by childminders at every level.  We represent over 4,000 childminding contacts throughout the country, with both childminders and parents using our services.  We actively encourage childminders to become engaged.  We believe in a grassroots approach and in empowering childminders. <\/p> <p>  For the first time in the history of the State, all childminding is being included in the regulatory and support system.  We urge the committee to recommend that the one organisation with an authentic childminding voice should be adequately funded.<\/p> <p>  I know members want to hear our thoughts on the action plan for childminding.  While Childminding Ireland supports the visions, aims and objectives of the action plan, we have serious concerns about the implementation.  The action plan promises many positives.  For example, training will be delivered in formats that are suited to childminders, while new regulations and a new inspection model specific to childminding will be introduced.  However, we are deeply concerned about the implementation of the plan as the initial signs from the workforce development planning process are not positive  The childminding sector should materially input on the shape of things to come and be in the majority, supported by relevant framework experts, for example, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and education and training boards, ETBs, for the training and supports advisory group.  The Department's method of consultation of childminders needs new thinking.  We know the Department was satisfied with the consultation on the draft action plan but we were not.<\/p> <p>  There needs to be active engagement with parents who choose childminders for their children.  Parental satisfaction with childminding is currently very high. Clarity is needed on the evaluation of progress. How will we know what is and is not working?<\/p> <p>  There is a lot yet to be decided.  We need new thinking.  The gravitational pull towards centre-based care as the norm is strong.  Recommendations for childminding are being made through the prism of the centre-based view.  The workforce development plan steering group is currently without a single childminding representative and the structures feeding into the group are dominated by centre-based interests.<\/p> <p>  Our recommendations are as follows.  There are thousands of childminders that are unengaged and unaware that the action plan exists.  This must be acknowledged and addressed.  Childminders and those proximate to childminding must be in the majority on all of the advisory groups for the action plan.  It is inappropriate for those not proximate to childminding to make recommendations for an entire workforce.  Childminding Ireland must have a seat on the steering group for the workforce development plan.  Childminding Ireland needs to be appropriately resourced to support and represent childminding and parents, particularly at this time of change.  <\/p> <p>  I thank committee members for their time and attention and we are happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernadette Orbinski Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>As the Chair said earlier, our CEO sends her apologies.  She is attending a meeting with the Department but hopes to be here in time for the follow-up questions and answers.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the opportunity to present to the committee today about the recently published national action plan for childminding.  As the leading support organisation in our sector, we have broadly welcomed the plan.  Childminding is regulated in most European countries and Early Childhood Ireland strongly believes the move to regulate the currently informal childminding sector in Ireland is in the best interests of children.<br\/><br\/>The plan recognises and we agree that childminding plays a central role in the provision of both early learning and care and school-age childcare in Ireland.  The plan follows through on the commitments made in the First 5 strategy published in late 2018 and in last year&rsquo;s programme for Government.  It estimates that there are approximately 15,000 non-relative childminders in Ireland.  At the moment, the Child Care Act 1991, as we have heard from previous speakers, exempts most childminders from regulation.  Currently fewer than 80 childminders are registered with Tusla.  One consequence of this is that the vast majority of childminders cannot take part in the national childcare scheme, so thousands of families cannot access subsidies to reduce the fees they pay.<br\/><br\/>Our second annual childcare barometer, which was published in 2019 and a link for which we have provided to members today, showed overwhelming public support for ensuring regulations and supports were extended to all paid childminders.  At that time, 87% of Irish adults were in favour of Garda vetting and basic training requirements for childminding and we believe that this was testament to the importance of this option for families.<br\/><br\/>The national action plan mainly addresses self-employed childminders who work in their own homes.  It is not primarily concerned with <i>au pairs<\/i>or nannies who work in the child's home.  The plan does, however, include an action to develop information and training resources in relation to them.  The plan will not extend regulation to those who solely care for children related to them.<br\/><br\/>Early Childhood Ireland recognises the scale of the challenge in moving childminding from an invisible, informal sector to a regulated, formal sector that sits properly within the early learning and care and school-age childcare systems.  Our learning from and experience of transitioning from an unregulated centre-based informal childcare sector to a regulated, publicly funded one highlights the importance of the availability of appropriate supports and phased transition periods.<br\/><br\/>It is also imperative that the registration process is smooth and clear for childminders.  The timing of the phases will need to be signalled well in advance to them and to the statutory and non-governmental organisations tasked with supporting the sector so that we can all be ready.<br\/><br\/>The action plan sets out a phased approach to reform.  Phase 1 will be preparatory, lasting two to three years; phase 2 will be a transition phase, lasting three to five years; and phase 3 will involve full implementation and the end of all transitional arrangements.  Early Childhood Ireland believes that the phased approach to reform as set out in the plan is reasonable.<br\/><br\/>We have a concern about a caveat in the plan about timing, however:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhile the end-point is clear [we know that is 2028], the Action Plan leaves open the precise timing of movement between Phases 1, 2 and 3.  Given the potential cost to the Exchequer of opening the National Childcare Scheme to childminders, the timing of the transition from Phase 1 to 2 will be Budget-dependent and will depend on agreement with the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/blockquote><p>The Government must prioritise completing these phases given the interests of children and their families and to avoid unnecessary delays for childminders.  The estimates indicated in the plan are not exorbitant, rising to &euro;23 million annually by phase 3.  This amount of investment is not beyond the reach of a wealthy country.  It is vital that children of all ages can benefit from quality experiences, regardless of whether their parents avail of a childminder or a setting or both.<\/p><p> Early Childhood Ireland welcomes the publication of the National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028.  It is a positive step forward, as childminders already play a vital role in the provision of early learning and care and school-age childcare in Ireland.  This must be recognised, valued and supported.  We hope members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will play a role, collectively and individually, within their communities to support and promote this plan.

One recommendation this committee can certainly make, therefore, is that if the Minister is making decisions concerning a particular sector, it is important there be extensive consultation with representatives from that sector.  Turning to a point raised already, I am conscious of the informal nature of some childminding services.  We can see the major differences in the numbers between the estimates of how many childminders there are, how many are registered with Tusla and how many engage with the various organisations represented here today.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned that if we rush any attempt to regulate this area and we get it wrong, the ultimate consequence will be to drive childminders out of the sector.  People will just not mind children.  As someone who has experienced cr&egrave;che fees going up recently, that is not a good outcome for anyone and especially not for the children benefiting from these services now.  One of the ways to carry out a process such as this properly is to include the groups about to be regulated.  Equally, it is important to reach out to people.  The points made about the difficulty with engagement, the lack of it and its informal nature have been raised several times in several ways.<\/p><p>What I would love to hear from the witnesses is how we should reach out to childminders, the people we want to reach.

I thank all our witnesses for appearing.  Their presentations were interesting and informative.  We all recognise childcare has been underfunded, misunderstood and insufficiently respected for far too long.  To have this conversation and an action plan is, therefore, very positive.  We are looking at the pitfalls.  I know childminders and I have needed them.  From living in a rural area where there is not much access to centre-based care for children, I know that childminding is the only way people can have their children looked after.<\/p> <p>  With all this regulation, is there a risk of a significant drop-off in the number of childminders?  I believe there will be, although I hope that will not be the case.  Childminders may decide they only want to do this for a couple of years while their own children are young and then return to work when their children start school.  It may cause other childminders to decide they have been in the game long enough and give up or bow out.  I fear there will be a problem there with how we support childminders, the majority of whom are female.  How do we support and empower our childminders to give regulation to the incredible service they already provide.  We hand over our children to childminders because they are the second mothers and are so important to a family.<\/p> <p>  How will we create a balance between centre-based services and childminding?

Regulation will be something that, even with a light touch coming in gently, is a change of practice.  We know a change is something that takes a while for people to embrace and to engage with, depending on the level of change.  These are changes that will need to be made in the childminder's own home, and possibly to the infrastructure of the childminder's home and to the routine and order in it.  I would worry if it is not done in a way that brings childminders with them in terms of having built up trust, and that the trust, once regulation starts, will not snowball.  We know, from experience in centre-based care that some of the level of regulation required is excessive.  There are small services that cater for what could be 15 children up to services that cater for 300 children which are all experiencing the same level of regulation.  I suppose there would want to be absolute assurances for the childminders that is not something that will happen.<\/p> <p>  At the centre of this are children and their safety.  Obviously, that is paramount, but we need to do it in a phased way to prevent that drop off.

The past year has proven the centrality and absolute necessity of good-quality childcare and how essential it is to everybody's quality of life and ability to function, and particularly for the access to the workplace of women who, despite our best efforts, are in the main the primary carers.  One of the lessons we have learned from Covid has been that a hybrid working model is in our future and in order to do that, we need childminding alongside cr&egrave;che and centre-based facilities.<\/p> <p>  That said, I hear everything that the witnesses are saying about the fears with regard to regulation.  My experience of being an adviser within the county and city children committees and being involved within the childcare sector has been that the current inspection regime and regulation regime is arbitrary in its application, causes much administrative burden and is remarkably difficult.  I am looking forward to this committee reviewing that and taking it by the teeth and tearing it apart, I hope, into something that is more manageable because it is onerous for centre-based providers.  It is essential that the witnesses are involved in putting in place the regulations as we go forward.<\/p> <p>  Over the past couple of months, my party has conducted a widespread care-of-the-child consultation and we have run policy laboratories.  Arising out of that, we have found the priority - 81% of the participants were parents - that people required availability, affordability and location.<\/p><p>To me, childminding fits those requirements really nicely and well.  What do the witnesses believe are reasonable regulations?  What should be expected of childminders in their homes?  When it comes to qualifications, I believe they should all be QQI-accredited and that we should be setting up childminding as a career path and a career of choice for as many as possible and looking at qualifications in that regard.  We could use a grandfathering system in recognition of experience in respect of current childminders in a way that was not facilitated in professionalism and centre-based care.  We can learn from where we missed and lost people in that process in order that we can bring that forward and into this.  I would be particularly interested in hearing what the witnesses have to say about that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#E01200","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Does the Senator want to hear from everybody?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#F00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#F00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>That was a very insightful commentary.  I agree completely with the Senator regarding the gendered nature of the sector.  One of the things we often talk about is looking at early years and school-age care through a number of lenses.  As the Senator noted, despite progress and many of us wanting it to be different, it is a hugely gendered issue on the demand side.  It has a significant impact on working mothers whether we like it or not involving such things as cost.  This is not right but we also have a very gendered workforce and I include childminders in that.  Providers are overwhelmingly women who are all doing brilliant work but it would be wonderful to see more men in the sector.  A total of 98% of staff in settings are women.  What we really need is more investment so that salaries can increase and it becomes a viable career.<\/p> <p>  I also welcome what the Senator said about Covid.  We saw the sharp end of the way society can fall apart.  Many childminders were already working in pods.  Centre-based care had to catch up with that, so we learned a lot about our sector very broadly.  I do not think anybody has all the answers to the questions asked by the Senator.  As Ms Heeney said, it is about getting people around the table and making sure the people who are involved every day and know best are involved in the decision-making about that with obviously the best interests of children central to all our shared concerns.  I have no doubt that this will be the case.  There is a need for qualifications of some kind.  It should not necessarily be the same as what is currently expected from those who work in settings.  That said, workforce development planning is ongoing and will report by the end of the year.  There is currently a childminding working group,which presents us all with an opportunity to influence what comes out of that so by the end of this year, we will have some answers and guidance.  I know that Early Childhood Ireland and other organisations have been working very hard in those forums.  <\/p> <p>  I agree that the time is reasonable but the Government must really get serious about this both in terms of investment and communicating with parents, society and childminders most of all.  We often refer to parental choice.  What Early Childhood Ireland wants to see is that by 2028, parents will have genuine parental choice.  At the moment, there are parents who would love to choose a cr&egrave;che, childminder or a combination but as we heard from a member of the committee, cannot make a choice because of where they are.  It is about ensuring that everybody is brought in so that parents can fully act in the best interests of their children and make all those decisions appropriately.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The Senator asked what we need.

It is about developing those as micro-credentials, even if just two credits are given.  Childminders have engaged with a quality assurance process, QAP, supporting quality over a number of years.  There is work that goes into that, such as attendance at workshops etc.  If that had been developed into a micro-credential it would have met documented learning outcomes and childminders would have completed a certain amount of credits already.  It is the same if something is going to be done about child protection or early years services; we have the quality regulatory framework.  If all those courses are accredited, before we know it we would seamlessly have, at least a foundation, if not a level 5, qualification.  That is one matter that could be looked at.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Ward mentioned, regulation does cost more.  It is worth making the national childcare scheme, NCS, accessible to families to keep the cost down.  Two things are needed.  There will need to be grants and supports for childminders to be able to implement and meet the regulatory needs, whatever they are and as minimal as they should be.  For example, capital investment might be needed by childminders to buy some kind of equipment in order to meet fire safety requirements and so on.  From the parents' side, investment into the national childcare scheme is needed.  When childminders are able to register, parents will be able to avail of it.  However, the national childcare scheme, while it is brilliant at bringing in more parents and providing subsidies for more of them than previously, it does have difficulties and glitches in the maintenance of the system, such as the generation of childcare identifier code keys, CHICKs, to see how much a parent will be eligible for.  <\/p> <p>  Those kinds of things need to be sorted out because they will be an extra burden on childminders in engaging with the kind of practice they will need to.  On the results of Fine Gael's policy, a parent talked last night about the NCS and how she is finding it particularly challenging because it keeps changing and she keeps having to go back into the system.  Those glitches need to be worked out and there needs to be enough subsidy available to parents to make it worthwhile for them to sign up to avail of it.  The subsidy also needs to be made worthwhile for childminders when they are able to avail of it in the context of the responsibility and interactions they need to have about signing in, engaging with CHICKs and supporting parents around that.  Some of the glitches with the NCS need to be worked out.<\/p> <p>  I am not an advocate for tax incentives because it is presumed that people are paying tax and they are putting money in upfront etc.  A direct subsidy would be best, whether it is through childminders or families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I call Ms Heeney and Ms Walsh.

A fundamental principle is at play here, which is that as a State we have a responsibility to inspect these settings.  This is not because money is changing hands because it is not yet in most settings.  More money should be changing hands via the national childcare scheme.  The introduction of inspection regimes will facilitate that and it is in the best interest of children and families.  To have an inspection regime is absolutely a requirement the State must deliver on and I really welcome the fact that we are having that conversation today.  I just want to confirm that.<\/p> <p>  As to the level of the inspection regime, while I do not like the phrase \"light touch\" because it is synonymous with bad times in the very recent past in this country, the regime does need to be negotiated and discussed with people who work in this field.  At the very minimum, we want to build on what it is about the childminding setting that parents are choosing.  They are choosing a home-based setting, so absolutely we do not want to close a kitchen or garden.  Those are the things parents are choosing and what they enjoy about using a childminding home, so we need to make sure they are retained.  However, we must make sure that places are safe, the food children get is nutritious and there are no fire issues, for example.  The fundamentals of a safe location, to begin with, are important.  I will not go into the issue but the national childcare scheme, in our view, needs to be available to all families who are using childminders.  We need to build on the national childcare scheme because it does afford us an opportunity to develop a model of support in order to deliver a more affordable childcare system in this country.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Heeney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":434,"content":"<p>On affordability or making childcare more expensive, no major capital investment is required for childminders.  The house and building are there although equipment is possibly needed.  Unless regulation is overly onerous, no major investment will be required.

That is really important because many childminders have come through the system already and left it because of over-regulation.  That needs to be addressed in order to bring those people back.  A lot of money was spent in the early 2000s on childminders who left the system completely because cr&egrave;che-based regulations were imposed on them and they were frightened out of the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I confirm I am in Agriculture House on the Leinster House campus.  I thank everyone for coming in today.  It is a very interesting conversation, one that has been a long time coming and has been a long time needed.  I used childminders because it was, essentially, like having a second mammy for my children.  They would go to the childminder's house, do their homework and cook with her children.  They had someone who loved them looking after them and taking care of them.  That is something really valuable.  Each family and child are different and a child's care needs are different.  We need to have all those choices.  At different stages, each child needs different levels and types of care.  I always picked a childminder for the first couple of years.  When my children needed a little more socialisation or formalisation they went into an early childhood care and education, ECCE, or cr&egrave;che-based scheme.  We need to ensure that choice is available for families and that all families can use it.<\/p> <p>  From speaking to friends of mine who mind children, they are really nervous about this and are concerned about what it could mean for them.  The communication part of this will be absolutely key.  Ms Heeney talked about pension insurance.  A huge number of benefits and securities could potentially be built into this system for childminders, while still getting the balance right and having very family-based care being given.  However, communication will be the biggest issue in all of this.  It is not just about what the childminders want to see, although that is obviously a large part of it.<\/p><p>Anyway, it is important that we will talk to parents to find out exactly why they send their children to childminders.  Much of the time it is out of a sense of love of family and normal living in someone else's house.  That is what they are seeking when they send their children to a childminder.  It is also about simplicity and handiness.  The childminder picks up the children at school and does all the normal things.<\/p><p> It is about ensuring that we bring all of that into the system.  I believe there has to be a community-based, grassroots approach to this system if we bring it in or if it does get put in.  Do the representatives see a role for county childcare committees in that regard?  Much of the time, childcare in other countries is regulated and managed on a community basis.  Is that a better approach?  I do not imagine that approach would bring the sense of fear if that was how it was managed and rolled out.<\/p><p> I have to ask Ms Lane a question about the goldfish policy.  What was that about?

A Tusla representative came in and saw that we have a goldfish.  Questions were asked.  Will the children touch it?  Who cleans it?  Who feeds the fish?

We were told we have to have a goldfish policy and that the fish had to be put up out of reach and sealed off.  The children can look but not touch it.  They never did touch it anyway because I am careful.  The point was we had to have the policy written out.  It is same with the hen.  We were told the hen cannot run around the garden.  She is in an enclosed run.  The children were not allowed touch it or do anything.  That was it simply.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ward discussed the national childcare scheme.  Payment under the scheme is hourly based but childminders charge per day or maybe per half day.  This has been a problem with the scheme.  Perhaps a parent has not been taking the full day for a time and the money has been recouped by the Department or Pobal or whoever.  That is causing a problem for full-day carers.  It would be a major problem for a childminder who is expecting &euro;200 to come in for a week if &euro;20 or &euro;30 is taken back.  This has to be reported.

My apologies - I am jumping in and out of two committees at the same time.  It seems that in the parts I have jumped in for many of my questions have come up and have been answered.<\/p> <p>  I will hone in a little on what is coming up for me in some conversations.  I relied on childminders especially when I was earning little and when I wanted to go to college.  I reckon there is a need for professionalisation in terms of the safety of children.  However, there is a fear of over-professionalisation and a judgment of what childcare should look like.  It comes up for me as an issue in communities where there might be limited literacy or early school leaving.  There are all sorts of fears around Tusla and institutions.  We have all these things acting in the background but they are no less capable or less able to be childminders for neighbours or friends or the daughters of friends.  That is how I availed of childcare.  Many of the childminders I used would shy away from being part of any regulated system or from registering with Tusla.  How can the action plan operate in a way that we can recognise the professionalism of the work without over-professionalising it to the point where women and mothers, especially those who are least well off and in low paid jobs, are not completely excluded from extra financial supports?  Is the balance failing in the action plan?  How is this panning out?  How can we ensure that women and one-parent families can be supported?  How can we ensure that we do not impose some sort of ideal or fairy-tale idea of what some person's house is supposed to look like when a childminder is minding a neighbour's child?  I am concerned that my scenario is being replicated throughout our communities.  I am mindful of the difference that having access to childcare supports would have made to my life.  I definitely would have been caught out and would have been unable to access centralised childcare or pay for private childcare.  There are many people in limbo in that sense.  Does the proposed action plan adequately address the barriers faced by childminders?  Some of them may register but some might have fears of registering.  How do we alleviate those fears?  People are afraid they will be means tested or that there will be on-the-spot checks on their home.  Not every community would be into that.  Sometimes that fear is not grounded in the childminding ability but simply in the lives and the environment in which people grow up and live.  It is not so much a question but more of a concern that has come up.

Of course there are issues of concern that would extend to mothers.  I say \"mothers\" because, as we said earlier, it is largely to mothers that all of this decision-making falls.

We use the word \"diversity\" loosely but it is important that equality is front and centre in all of its forms and visibilities.  There are communities where we have already seen issues in regard to the national childcare scheme, for instance, where people who are not working have had to seek sponsorship and there was huge fear around having to register with Tusla.  As the Senator said, that fear is not necessarily based on anything in particular and there was no suggestion that anything untoward was going on.  It was just a fear people had.  It is very good that the Government and the Department recognised that issue and expanded the list of sponsored organisations.  That type of thinking will need to happen in terms of the development of the national action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I completely understand the Senator's concerns and I really welcome her raising them.  There is such a wide variety of childminders that every family should be able to find one who replicates their family setting.  I completely agree that children should be cared for locally.  An issue of concern to Childminding Ireland is that all the barriers and thresholds to entering into childminding would be tackled and the system made as open and inclusive as possible.  With great respect to everybody who is working hard in all the various groups, there tends to be a self-selecting cohort of people involved in those groups, often people who have been through education systems and all the rest of it and are used to working around a table and so on.  We need to be completely dedicated to ensuring that every single communication that goes out and every single role profile and course that is created is as open, broad and welcoming as possible and uses plain English.  Sometimes people mistake the desire to professionalise with using language and terminology that can become a barrier.  Professionalism is a very subjective thing.

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for taking the time to attend the meeting, especially Ms Walsh, who is from Cornanool outside Castlebar.  She is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  The early learning and childcare sectors, along with childminding services, have shown real leadership during the pandemic in remaining open and caring for the children of essential workers at a time of real anxiety across our society.  We must acknowledge that.  As someone from a rural constituency, I understand the challenges facing parents in accessing childminding and childcare services.  It can be extremely difficult, as other members referenced.  It is not always feasible to have centre-based providers within a particular geographic area.  We need a variety of both home-based and centre-based provision.  It is also important that we keep children locally.  Having children cared for locally feeds into the preschools, which is hugely important for enrolment numbers in rural national schools.  If parents are commuting to nearby towns and must take their children to be minded there, there is a much increased likelihood that those children will go on to attend a primary school there rather than the one down the road from their home.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Orbinski Burke on a specific point concerning her opening statement.  She said that Childminding Ireland's core objectives are to support and represent childminders but it is chronically restricted in its efforts to do so due to underfunding.  Will she outline what level of resources or funding would be necessary to support the organisation under the regulatory and support system for the sector in the years ahead?  I would also like to hear from the stakeholders present on their experience to date with the steering group that is overseeing the implementation of the action plan.  Do they feel they are getting the required representation and recognition within the decision-making process and being consulted effectively as we move to the implementation stages, including in respect of the workforce development planning process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021052500002#J00300","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I was going to ask Ms Orbinski Burke to respond first but there seems to be a technical issue with her connection.

I will not address the one he specifically put to Ms Orbinski Burke.  One of the things we need to be in these discussions is ambitious for the early years and childcare sector in Ireland.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, our sector has really delivered throughout the pandemic.  We must not forget that and it certainly must not be forgotten in the forthcoming budget.  We are in the middle of discussions about a new funding model and a workforce development plan.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, shared with us in the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago that he is hopeful of an increase in the budget for this sector arising out of the findings of those engagements.<\/p> <p>  One of the points I want to make is that we would never plan an education system for primary schools without seeking to ensure that children do not have to travel far to attend school.  It is not beyond us to plan similarly for younger children.  We need a local planning mechanism that has an appropriate line of sight on the number of childminders working within a local area and also takes into account the number of playschools and centre-based settings.  This would enable us to know the capacity of each individual rural area, education district or whatever measure we want to use and allow us to plan for an expansion of the sector, whether by increasing the number of childminders or centre-based settings.  We absolutely must be ambitious for the sector and plan properly in order to ensure a large, diverse mix of provision in each local area.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question regarding the steering group for the implementation plan, my understanding is that the group has not yet been convened.  It is up to all of us to ensure the voices that need to be around the table will be accommodated.  I agree with my colleagues that childminders should be at that table and that we must get a good range of voices.

When we look at the budget, the Government has indicated that it will at least double the spending on early childhood education and care, and school-aged childcare over then next ten years.  A significant portion of that must go towards childminding.  Another significant portion must go to school-aged childcare, along with continuing to resolve the issues in centre-based services, where they are experiencing a staffing crisis and increasing costs.<\/p> <p>   The statement in the action plan is reasonable, which must be acknowledged, but it states that the phases and how the action plan progresses is budget dependent.  This is worrying in relation to the potential stop-starting, as was mentioned earlier, and then having to cherry-pick areas to develop because of a lack of funding.  In centre-based service, many difficulties have happened as a result of sequencing and out of sequencing of policy implementation.  That is something we must be careful of in childminding.  If it is to be budget dependent, we should not cherry-pick in an order that creates perverse consequences or difficulties in the sector.

ETBs manage and operate community national schools, second level schools, further education colleges and a range of adult and further education centres in communities throughout Ireland.  Our initial written submission highlights the views and experiences of the sector in more detail, while this statement outlines some of the more significant observations.<\/p> <p>  The parallel matters of bullying and mental health have never been more to the fore, particularly in recent months.  Research informs us of the significant impact of bullying on mental health in \"normal\" circumstances and this has no doubt been compounded in different ways as we tackle our Covid-19 response.  In addition, the relationship between bullying and mental health is further challenged by the reality that some young people are bullied because of their mental health issues and some develop mental health issues because of being bullied.<\/p> <p>  The policies and practices of anti-bullying procedures in schools under the patronage of ETBs at both primary and post-primary level are directed in the first instance by Department of Education procedures, guidelines and circulars.  Additional materials and resources are accessed through the support agencies, such as the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the professional development service for teachers and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.<\/p> <p>  As mentioned in our longer written submission, ETBI also wishes to acknowledge and reaffirm the significance of school culture as an important influence on tackling bullying at local level.  The ETB core values of excellence in education, care, respect, equality and community lay the foundation for a responsive and restorative approach at individual, collective and community level for tackling both bullying and any aligned mental health impacts.  ETB schools are unique in that they are Ireland's state school model and, as state schools, we provide for all children equally in a multi-denominational context.  In consultation with our schools, ETBs have developed a clear ethos and we can confidently describe ETB schools as state, pro-education and multi-denominational, underpinned by the core values of excellence in education, care, equality, community and respect.<\/p> <p>  The ethos permeates all aspects of life in our schools, including our approaches to behaviour and anti-bullying measures.  Research indicates that children and young people experience bullying as a result of various aspects of their identity.  Our ethos, which informs the explicit and informal curriculum, teaches children and young people to recognise and value diversity in all areas of life.<\/p> <p>  In addition to incorporating Department of Education policy and its requirements, schools in the ETB sector also endeavour to engage in whole sector approaches that demonstrate and adopt diversity of engagement.  These models of practice originate both within and outside of the formal education sector and aim to embed a preventative approach where possible.  These engagements include the Goodness Me, Goodness You programme, which underpins the community national school policy to respect and recognise diversity, the instructional leadership programme that supports schools to facilitate the voice of the learner and ETB schools&rsquo; engagement in the BeLongTo &ndash; Safe and Supportive Schools programme, embracing a whole-school community model designed to create schools that are fully inclusive of LGBTI+ young people.<\/p> <p>  As acknowledgement and recognition of local and cultural context, many individual ETBs supplement specific elements of existing programmes with transition year, leaving certificate applied, and as part of individual subject specifications across the formal curriculum.  In the informal and non-formal school community, student support and the impact of \"one good adult\" can be witnessed through the work of student support teams, the well-being programme, extracurricular, cross-curricular and community links, as well as the contribution to and from parents and guardians.  Structured local programmes are also utilised where appropriate, such as the empathy education programme and the restorative justice approach.<\/p> <p>  The ETB sector endeavours to be responsive and pre-emptive in its approach to bullying and any mental health impacts but it will also continue to advocate for additional beneficial supports aligned to these matters.  Our current recommendations include school-based resources related to online harassment and harmful communications, as well as initiatives which support the resilience and positive mental health of our staff, including principals, deputy principals, teachers and support staff.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, it can be difficult to identify when students in our care are involved in bullying, whether as the person being bullied, the perpetrator, or both, and there are many ways that a young person can be affected both within and outside the school setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I must ask Ms O'Dwyer to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#B00100","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Continuing to advocate for and assist in supporting students through any mental health challenges that may affect them as a result of bullying is a priority for our partners.<\/p> <p>  We thank the committee for inviting Education and Training Board Ireland to engage with it on these issues and affording us the opportunity to reflect the varying impacts and experiences of the education and training board sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Dwyer for that.

The CPSMA is the management support organisation for Catholic primary schools.  Since the school closure in March of last year we have dealt with more than 15,000 queries from approximately 2,400 schools.<br\/><br\/>I believe schools are putting a huge amount of time and effort into proactive strategies to make school environments as welcoming and inclusive as they can be and, on the whole, those strategies are working, according to the vast majority of children in our schools.  Schools have comprehensive social, personal and health education, SPHE, curricular plans where the focus is on building relationships and developing skills needed for children to engage with each other.  Many schools also engage in the Friends for Life, Incredible Years and other whole school programmes to build resilience and foster good relationships.  Wellbeing is at the heart of many schools&rsquo; self-evaluation process and initiatives such as restorative practices, wellbeing and friendship weeks, buddy benches and amber flag schemes, among others, help promote the values of respect and tolerance as well as educating children on how to engage appropriately with others.  <br\/><br\/>This work is paying off.  As the latest chief inspector's report notes: <\/p> <blockquote> \tPrimary schools were found to be managing their pupils well and the vast majority of parents are happy with their child&rsquo;s school.  In particular, questionnaire results from pupils and parents indicate a very high level of satisfaction with the arrangements in place in many schools to promote positive relationships and to tackle bullying. <\/blockquote> <p>The Growing up in Ireland study also found, &quot;A very large majority of 9-year-olds (93%) said they liked school&quot; which, I suggest, is a major change from how school was experienced in times gone by.  <br\/><br\/>We also all remember the many images of smiling and joyous children delighted to be returning to school buildings in the media last September, reinforcing the importance and value of primary education for children&rsquo;s socialisation as well as their education.  However, relationships are complex and require work on an ongoing basis.  If they break down for whatever reason, all schools have anti-bullying procedures, in line with circular 45\/2013, to deal with that, which are annually reviewed.  When a report comes to a school either through observation or from a pupil or parent, schools follow that policy.  This would entail an investigation of the alleged incident where the class teacher and-or the principal would talk to the parties involved.  A breakdown in relationships is a very complex matter.  It can take time to establish what is occurring and whether bullying is substantiated.  The school engages with both parties to repair and restore the relationship using restorative practices.  Schools do much good work in this area.  It can provide opportunities for healing. <br\/><br\/>However, schools are also experiencing a rise in interpersonal issues which are occurring outside of school on social media.  There is an obligation to deal with these matters in school in certain circumstances as part of the anti-bullying procedures, which can be extremely challenging as the school has no control of what happens when a pupil leaves the school grounds.  Schools are also reporting to us that these issues are taking up more and more time at the expense of teaching and learning. <br\/><br\/>While schools are implementing the procedures laid out, targeted training should be provided for teachers and boards of management on the educational responsibilities for schools, strategies to deal with investigations and restorative practices to resolve such issues.  Training for parents also needs to be provided to help them support their children in building and maintaining relationships and to educate them on how the anti-bullying procedures are implemented by schools.  A review of the Department of Education&rsquo;s anti-bullying procedures from 2013 should take place in consultation with school communities.<br\/><br\/>Schools require increased supported in dealing with mental health issues in general.  The presence of the National Educational Psychological Service psychologists is now rarer than our most endangered bird species, the corncrake, while a referral to the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, can take up to 18 months.  This is neither fair to children nor schools and should be addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I now call our final witness, Mr. John Curtis, general secretary of the Joint Managerial Body, JMB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#B00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":479,"content":"<p>It is nice to see the Chairman again, albeit remotely.  I thank her for her kind opening remarks.<br\/><br\/>The Joint Managerial Body welcomes the Oireachtas joint committee&rsquo;s focus on the topic of bullying and mental health and is grateful for this opportunity to present an opening statement on behalf of the organisation.  Our position is that student bullying, and its impact on mental health, can only be addressed when our anti-bullying policies are schoolwide, SPHE-driven and properly resourced.  There is no silver bullet which will resolve the problem of bullying in schools.  We need every single person in the school to attack the problem from every possible aspect every single day.<br\/><br\/>Anti-bullying policies in our schools reflect this schoolwide approach.  I will take one example, which is a live anti-bullying policy in one of our schools.  That policy states our aim is to provide an environment in which all can teach, learn and work, free from intimidation.  It also states we will achieve this by: ensuring all parents-guardians have access to this policy prior to commencing school; assigning a teacher to lead the anti-bullying ambassadors; introducing initiatives on how to recognise and deal with bullying; placing an emphasis on inclusion by meitheal leaders in their work with first year students, emphasising inclusion and awareness of bullying in the school environment by prefects in their work; including bullying in the code of behaviour and in school journals; educating students through the SPHE and Wellbeing programme at junior cycle regarding bullying in all its forms, including cyberbullying, homophobic and transphobic bullying; educating students through the relationship and sexuality education programme by providing opportunities to explore and discuss areas such as human sexuality and relationships, which have particular relevance to identity based bullying; ensuring that within the teaching of all subjects there is an attitude of respect for all to promote the value of diversity, to address prejudice and stereotyping and to highlight the unacceptability of bullying behaviour; ensuring appropriate supervision of students; providing an anonymous comment box for general use, including bullying issues; and ensuring bystanders understand the importance of telling if they witness or know that bullying is taking place.<br\/><br\/>Meanwhile, the recently published OECD report Education at a Glance ranks Ireland in last place out of 36 countries for investment in second level education as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP.  The Department repeatedly sets out high demands for schools in respect of anti-bullying measures but clearly the State is neglecting its responsibility to provide its schools with the resources we need to tackle bullying effectively and to support positive mental health development in our students. <br\/><br\/>Our schools have been doing more with less since the financial crash of 2009.  In particular, schools have had reduced allocations of teachers and guidance counsellors which have not been restored.  Yet, our teacher workforce numbers have increased.  This is due to significant student population growth but at school level, the cuts in staffing have never been fully restored. <br\/><br\/>What we would ask for is the following; we need our year heads and student support teams to have time for duties, ring-fenced and allocated for; our guidance and counselling provision fully restored; a full deputy principal in every school; to invest in team teaching and greater learning support for students with special educational needs; teacher training and ongoing expert advice, particularly on empowering students to speak out; leadership development on schoolwide approaches that work; free up time for the necessary in-school group meetings involved, particularly regarding teachers investigating incidents of bullying; our schools will always face the challenge of bullying and, among other actions, every school continues to review its existing policies in line with the Department&rsquo;s anti-bullying procedures from<i><\/i>2013; ensure its SPHE programme is well developed and well delivered; provide teacher professional development on anti-bullying strategies; and provide for parent and student support in tackling online bullying in particular.<br\/><br\/>The mental health of our young people has never been at greater risk.  We must now invest in giving schools the resources they need to support this uniquely challenged generation.<\/p><p> In my opening statement, I have amplified our original submission to the Oireachtas in February.  I will make two further points to follow up on some contributions at earlier meetings.  We need exemplification of best practice from schools in other jurisdictions.  We also need external supports in terms of facilitating an ongoing voice for leaders in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Curtis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#C00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for appearing before us.

A good and effective school culture is discussed and known by every member of staff and is visible to students in every engagement they have with teachers and other students.  No one feels belittled in a school that has a positive culture of care and respect.  Everyone feels valued and that he or she has a voice that will be heard if something happens inside or outside a classroom that upsets the student's day or time at school.  Everyone has a responsibility for a school's culture, but it has to come from the leadership - the patron, the board of management, the principal and the deputy principal.  Everyone in the school needs to know that he or she has a responsibility to contribute.<\/p> <p>  Regarding training and support, we have done a great deal of work on our core values and characteristic spirit across every ETBI school over the past five years.

That is distinct from what was the case 20 or 30 years ago.  Mr. Mulconry mentioned the importance of interpersonal relationships.  Obviously, bullying derives from the breakdown of those relationships.  We place many duties on teachers but what role do schools have in trying to resolve interpersonal difficulties when relationships break down in school, for example, between students inside and, more difficultly, outside school?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#C00500","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":485,"content":"<p>It is even more fundamental than that.  One of the key roles of primary schools is the socialising of children, that is, providing children with an opportunity to learn how to get on with other people, including people they do not particularly like at times.  That has been a core role of schools for some time.  Where it has become more important is that children now have a great deal less time for or experience of unstructured play outside the school.  When many of us were growing up, we would have spent a great deal of time out on the street or out in the countryside interfacing with other children of all ages and having the corners rubbed off us, as it were.  That does not happen to the same extent any more.  Schools have a greater focus on trying to manage those interpersonal relationships and giving children the skills to get on with one another.  It is something that schools are doing constantly.<\/p> <p>  Bullying is an indication that something is not working.  When it is identified, we need to crack down on it as quickly as possible.  That is difficult, however, because the word \"bullying\" is now used for many behaviours that are not necessarily bullying.  If a child calls a teacher down to a yard, the first thing the teacher is told is, \"He is bullying me\", but it may have just been a push or shove.  Sometimes, this stems from different expectations because young people from different backgrounds who are starting school are rubbing up against one another for the first time.  There are many things happening that are quite normal and need to be managed, but not overly so.  At the same time, we need to be able to identify bullying and deal with it quickly when it occurs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Interpersonal relationships have probably been made more complicated by technology.

We all have to upskill ourselves to deal with them.  We also need some external help.  We made a submission on the online safety Bill.

The three organisations before us are involved in the business of providing support and guidance to the people who run our primary and secondary schools.  My first question relates to a scenario that I have often encountered, that is, where bullying is connected to the school but continues outside the school, be that through social media, on the street or wherever.  Unfortunately, I have encountered situations where parents have been frustrated by their experience with a school's attitude, which was effectively that bullying outside the school was not its problem.  Attitudes are evolving in that regard and some schools are proactive, but will the three organisations give a brief insight into how they advise that such situations be addressed?  Although it is challenging, it is important that, where there is a connection to a school, there is a responsibility on the school.<\/p> <p>  I noted that at least two of the three organisations mentioned the online safety commissioner, which is a vital piece of work.  Previously, the ASTI mentioned that it would be beneficial if the large social media platforms had a contact person available to schools as a resource for incidents of online bullying.  Will the witnesses comment on this point?<\/p> <p>  I do not need them to comment on my next point, but I agree with the comments made by the CPSMA regarding mental health services.<\/p> <p>  Are the witnesses confident that enough data are being gathered by schools and the Department on bullying, including its incidence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#C01000","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Does Ms O'Dwyer wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#C01100","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I might respond to the last question first on whether the Department is collecting enough data.<\/p><p>The review of the 2013 anti-bullying procedures gives a fantastic opportunity for the Department to look at how it can collect data.  In that is an annual checklist, which should be reviewed.  I agree with my colleagues, who have stated this already.  The Department should use that checklist.  It could easily be developed into an online form on which to collect data.  Every school has to put this in front of its board of management every year.  They should be asked additional questions, such as how many cases they had to deal with in the year, how they dealt with them, what their success rate was and what methodologies they used.<\/p><p> Getting back to the Deputy's previous question, I suggest that the restorative approach is one of the most beneficial and sustainable approaches to deal with bullying, whether it is bullying within the school or bullying that permeates outside the school or the online space.  Mr. Mulconry mentioned this already.  If a restorative approach is used, it means that the perpetrator of the bullying is not demonised.  He or she is also a young person growing up and our educator function is that he or she learns not to engage in this behaviour.  A restorative approach, therefore, means that person must show that he or she takes personal responsibility and empathises with the feeling of the person who is being offended and really hurt by this.  There is a whole process around that.<\/p><p> I suggest that at the moment, we do not have enough of a strategic approach to training teachers in all our schools in that approach.  Teachers need to have basic skills to deal restoratively with behaviour in the classroom.  Dealing with bullying in a restorative way requires skills and competencies that not all teachers have, however.  If we are being strategic when we are reviewing the procedure, that is one area in which we should put in cyclical training.  Teachers need to be renewed in this approach at least every two or three years.  When it works, it is amazingly positive for everybody.<\/p><p> One of the most important elements is that having reported the bullying, the victim is not worried that something will happen again.  If the punitive method is used, the victim is still going around worrying if something will happen to him or her again because he or she was a snitcher, whereas if one uses a restorative approach, the victim is empowered in the process but the relationship is also restored.  That is one area I would like to see included in a very strategic way, where we decide we will train a team of teachers in every primary and post-primary school in a cyclical way.  We know this is an evidence-informed approach that really works and is sustainable.  It has implications for future life and future relationships, and it is a really important educator function of our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Dwyer.

I am old enough to have been around when the social, personal and health education, SPHE, and original relationships and sexuality education, RSE, guidelines came in.

We want to have the best people in our school engaging in these issues with our students and pupils.  Sometimes, it is a battle to get people to engage.

On one level, much work is being done on this but perhaps more needs to be done to make parents aware of the difficulties and the problems around online engagement.<\/p> <p>  Prohibition, certainly with regard to the pupils we have in our schools, would be difficult.

The Lockers programme that was provided by the Department and Webwise a number of years ago is an excellent programme that should be provided again.  I suggest that teachers should be trained in providing that.<\/p> <p>  In relation to younger children, I would say again to parents that I would not allow it.  I reared three teenagers in the last ten years.  I would not have allowed them into a youth club down the road with no supervision.  If one provides a smartphone to a child, with no filters and no supervision, that is exactly what one is doing.  One is allowing them into a whole world of rooms with no supervision.  There is a lot of responsibility in relation to providing phones for children in primary school without that support and understanding of the impact, particularly that of watching and observing pornography online at an early age.  We know the impact that can have later on.<\/p> <p>  In respect of co-educational schools, I can give my personal experience, having worked in both single-sex and co-educational schools.  I strongly recommend co-educational education.  It is normal for children to grow up and mix.  When they are learning the SPHE curriculum, which we talked about earlier, in the context of a mixed school, it is a much healthier place for children to speak about the important issues of managing themselves, consent and sexuality issues.

As it is quite clear, I thank them their involvement throughout the course of this section of our work.<\/p> <p>  I seek their views in relation to the use of technology, technology as a tool of the modern era and over-restriction with regard to technology.  Could we be doing a disservice to young people who are not learning how to manage themselves in all areas of life?  Politicians&rsquo; lives are very much in the middle of technology but, for the most part, adults&rsquo; lives are different, depending on their generation.  We do have a responsibility.<\/p> <p>  Either Mr. Mulconry or Mr. Curtis raised the point that there used to be more time out on the street to kick about and to mix with people of all ages.  I have brought this up previously but I wonder whether separating people by age is always the best way to go about dealing with young people through our education system.  It is not normal life.  It is not what happens outside of school and outside of the education system.  When we go to work, we mix with people of all different ages.  The only time we will be with people who all are the one age is when we are in school.  Do witnesses have a view on how we might change the education system to better reflect the kind of relationships that we have in the outside world? <\/p> <p>  Last week, Mr. Matthew Ryan from the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, raised the question of how much we empower young people to make decisions in the school system around how to deal with bullying and what kind of structures are put in place.  He quite rightly said that we, as adults, do not have the same experience of the technological world, for instance.  Through their own patron bodies, how much do the witnesses involve young people in decision-making on how to deal with bullying?  <\/p> <p>  The Growing up in Ireland study mentioned that many things have changed for young people.  However, it did still say in the most recent report that 10% of 13-year-olds said they had felt bullied in the previous three months.  That is still quite significant.  That is touching a large number of families, if one considers that families may have two or three children.  That has an impact on family life as well.  It is important to remember that.  <\/p> <p>  Finally, in relation to RSE, does Mr. Mulconry feel confident that the kind of education in the 90% of schools that are Catholic is reflective of every family, gender identity and form of sexuality that we have in society?  Are children learning about respect for themselves and for their varying genders and identities? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#E00700","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. Mulconry first to respond directly before we move to the other two witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#E00800","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":509,"content":"<p>In the most recent resource that patrons have provided to schools, there is a question.  First, the class is asked to list out all the varying family types.  Second, they are asked what they have in common.  The answer is love.  Therefore, yes, I do believe that we are providing materials for students where they are taught to respect one another and the various types of family that are out there.  I do not have a concern about that.<\/p> <p>  I have many other concerns about how teachers need much more training in this area.  They also need to be much more comfortable in delivering it.  One problem that is not often noted about RSE is that no matter what one teaches in RSE, there will be a certain cohort of parents who will be annoyed, whether they are liberal or reactionary.  It is a delicate area and teachers tend to shy away from it.  If teachers had more training, they would be better able to engage with parents.  Everybody would be more comfortable and all of us would do a better job.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the use of technology.  There is evidence that increased use of technology is leading to shorter attention spans in human beings.  In the future, the real competitive advantage will lie with those people who can concentrate for longer.  I spent about ten years working in the technology sector.  One of the things one has to understand about technology is that it is designed to be easy to use.  That is the whole point of successful technology.  We need to provide young people with a safe space up to a certain age before they engage with it.  Then we have to control their interactions with it to some degree in order that they can learn the positives, the benefits and how to manage it.  As I said earlier, technology is designed to be addictive.  We need to be careful that children do not lose out on other activities or on the social engagement that comes from hanging around with a group of peers in the physical world.  That is vitally important to their development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulconry.

In the context of the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programmes, I am adamant that we have made great progress in recent years regarding inclusion in our schools and having a focus on areas such as homophobia and bullying.  The ethos of our schools is predicated on kindness and love, as Mr. Mulconry said.  If we are not looking after the interests of every child in our schools, then something is wrong.  Those principles are, must be and will continue to be fundamental to everything we do.<\/p> <p>  The impact of technology has many lessons for us all.  I still struggle with aspects of it.  If I was a youngster now who was on Facebook, for instance, with likes and dislikes and followers and unfollowers, I think the overall impact of all those aspects on children must be huge.  We are still only scratching the surface concerning what technology is doing to the children in our care and that is why we must be so attentive to them.  We must place a great emphasis on mental health and resource our schools properly.  <\/p> <p>  I was not whingeing, by the way, when I mentioned the issue of resources for our schools at the start.  Our schools are fantastic places and we do so much with the resources we have.  The work we would like to do, however, is dependent on the people in our schools having the time to do it.  We are concerned that principals have so much on their plates now that perhaps the important matters get left aside because they have been running around following up on other things.  When I say I am seeking resources, therefore, I am not doing that in any kind of venal way.  Rather, I am seeking those resources from the perspective of trying to support our schools to engage and look after the welfare of the pupils, especially in this difficult and complex time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the point made by Senator Pauline O'Reilly about the relationships across age groups in schools.

I will start with Ms O'Dwyer, who represents the 16 ETBs.  My experience of having been a member of the Galway-Roscommon ETB is all that allows me to even begin to understand the breadth of activities undertaken by the ETBs.  Their remit extends from primary schools to secondary schools and all the way to higher and further education.  The ETBs are involved, therefore, in every stage of education.  I really appreciate the core values and the ethos that has been spoken of, which is very important, as well as the diversity.  The training delivered through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, has been acknowledged.  The key feature for me is the significance of school culture.  Ms O'Dwyer also acknowledged the importance of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, also known as Coco's Law.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Dwyer mentioned an empathy education programme in her submission, which I think is being worked on in conjunction with Professor Pat Dolan of NUI Galway.  I ask Ms O'Dwyer to give us an example in that regard.  Many of the speakers referred to the restorative justice approach and I am very interested in that aspect.  Ms O'Dwyer also mentioned identifying bullying in her submission and it was also mentioned by representatives of the teaching unions last week.  How do we improve the skills and abilities of all teaching staff, special needs assistants, SNAs, and everybody in the school environment in being able to watch out for tell-tale signs?  How is that done?  I ask because it seems to be an issue.  <\/p> <p>  In a question for all our witnesses, and I mentioned this aspect last week as well, how do we set up role play so that people know what to do when there is a bullying incident?  I refer to how it can be identified, who can be spoken to about such an incident in a school and the measures that can be taken in the school environment.  How do we approach those aspects to ensure that people become very aware of this area and such a perspective becomes natural?  I refer to situations where a bystander sees something of this nature, in any shape or form, and the steps that can subsequently be taken in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  Moving to Mr. Curtis, I did not realise that the Joint Managerial Body represented 380 voluntary secondary schools.  That is very impressive.  I appreciate that he mentioned that bullying is always going to be a challenge and that it is the response which matters.  I also appreciate that he noted in this regard that anti-bullying policies should be school-wide.  I would like Mr. Curtis to speak a little more about the concept of anti-bullying ambassadors, if we have time.  He also noted that \"teacher workforce numbers have increased\", and that is very true.  We have reduced the primary school teacher-pupil ratio to 1:25.  It was reduced by one point in the last budget, and I think that is historically one of the lowest ever ratios in primary schools.  <\/p> <p>  For Mr. Mulconry, and I hope I am pronouncing his name correctly, he is looking specifically at the Catholic primary schools.  He mentioned programmes such as well-being and friendship weeks and buddy benches.  Mr. Mulconry also stated that research has shown that \"parents are happy with their child's school\".  I challenge that point, because the research conducted by the anti-bullying centre, in conjunction with UNESCO, stated that one in three children suffers from cyberbullying.  Ireland had nearly the highest incidence in Europe in respect of the nine or ten countries where bullying was analysed in that research, and that probably includes cyberbullying as well.  Finally, and I may not be correct about this, I think Mr. Mulconry mentioned that now was not the right time to engage with schools on this issue.  I ask him to elaborate on that point.  I understand there is a great deal going on, but bullying is a very serious issue for us now.  I thank the witnesses.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#F00800","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dolan.

Anti-bullying ambassadors are a means of engaging with some of the older pupils in a school who can talk to younger kids, especially when they come into the school.  They can tell those new pupils that if they have issues they should be sure to report them to a responsible adult.  In that context, I refer to having enough people in schools to enable us to designate form teachers and give some additional hours to people like year heads and extra resources to guidance counsellors.  That is important, especially in the early stages, because the changeover from primary school to post-primary school can be quite traumatic.  We have found in recent years that we are doing more work in that sphere.  The induction procedures we undertake in schools are crucial.  It is also very important to engage the parents in that space as well.  The indicative programme to which I referred earlier gives us a sense of what is possible in schools.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the subject of identifying behaviour, this is a key aspect and it is evolving all the time.  I listened to Ms Stella O'Malley's engagement with the committee previously.  I found it very interesting, because in my time a gentleman called Brendan Byrne wrote the books on bullying.  We brought him into schools to speak to staff and parents.  Ms O'Malley's language is very interesting in this regard and I was very taken with it because I am learning in this area as well.  This is an important point.  All our school communities are still learning about bullying and that is why we need training.  She talked about being an \"upstander\" rather than a bystander and referred to the phrase, \"if it's mean, intervene\".  Those are beautiful little epithets we can use ourselves.  I reiterate that I am still learning in this space as well.<\/p> <p>  The question regarding when may be the right time for schools to engage with this area is an interesting one.  On one level, I will throw up my hands and say that we have been so busy in the last couple of years with other things that we have just not had time to address this area.  Senator Dolan is quite correct, though, about this being a crucial topic.  It is so important that we must re-engage with this aspect as soon as we can.  We must create an awareness of this issue, review our anti-bullying policies and examine the training it is possible to make available for teachers.  We must also look at outside assistance for schools.  When I am in a situation where, as a principal, I am left shaking my head because I do not know what to do, some counsellor should be available to assist.  The Ombudsman for Children referred to perhaps having a counsellor available in each school, but I do not know if that might be possible.  However, there should certainly be some outside agency that it would be possible to ring when a teacher finds himself or herself stumped by a situation.  It is also often necessary to have people to talk to parents as well.<\/p><p>In the context of restorative justice, often the difficulty we have is talking to the parents of the pupils involved and getting them on board, so to speak, in the context of the solutions that we have in mind, so that extra year and that extra help would be hugely important for the system if we could get the structures around it and managed in a proper way.<\/p><p> As Mr. Mulconry mentioned earlier, CAMHS is so difficult to engage with at the moment because of time pressure and NEPS as well because people are doing so many different things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Curtis.

The teacher engages with either a family member or somebody connected to the school who has a small baby and over the year the baby is the coach.  The teacher is coaching the students to engage with the baby.  The whole idea is that they observe the growth and development of a small baby and it develops their emotional connection and their empathy.  We know that at the root of bullying is a lack of empathy and this early intervention in particular with primary schoolchildren is about developing their empathy, their basic human kindness, their affection for the baby and their learning and understanding.  There is evidence from research which shows that it reduces aggression hugely and it develops empathy and social skills as well.  Whenever we have served it in primary schools everybody talks about it.  The children go home and talk to their parents about it.  The family engages in the conversations with the children as well and we hear back from the children, the teachers and the families that are involved that this is hugely impactful for children.  We know from longitudinal studies that even years later it has a huge impact on younger children so I think this is a programme we should certainly engage with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>When Senator Dolan talked about us not engaging with schools at this time, she may be referring to a letter which I wrote on behalf of all of the primary management bodies back in February.

If I were to ask what we could do that would really make a difference over the next five years, I suggest we look at how the junior cycle framework has been rolled out in the past five to six years.  A strategic approach was taken to it and a team was set up nationally.  A minimum standard of training was provided for everybody who needed to roll out all the different subjects and it was reviewed on a regular basis to see if that was happening.  Then the inspectorate came in and it wanted to see if it was happening and it measured it.  The same approach is required here.  We need a team of people, probably employed through the professional development service for teachers, PDST.  We need them to clearly outline the minimum standard of training required to provide a policy SPHE programme that really engages students.  Unfortunately, SPHE is not a subject recognised by the Teaching Council.  We do not have qualified SPHE teachers, so therefore we must provide supplementary training to SPHE teachers.  SPHE teachers are often teachers who have some hours left at the end of their timetable from their other subjects.  Instead of looking at it like that, we could decide that they are a priority group of teachers who require a minimum standard of really good quality training over a three-year cycle.  Then we will have to start again because there will be changes, the programmes will be reviewed, there will be new content and there will be changes in personnel.  That is a minimum that I would do.<\/p> <p>  Alongside that, we need training for leaders.  We must ask what is the role of a principal and a deputy principal to lead social, personal and health education and relationships and sexuality education in schools.  They must ask what their role is in the programme and how they are going to lead it.  I make the same suggestion in terms of what has happened in the junior cycle framework where the leaders are trained in their leadership role, because this is a very important and legitimate leadership function in all our schools.  If those two things were to happen, that would bring about a significant change.<\/p> <p>  Then we must decide what is the standard SPHE curriculum that we must see in every school.  There is a very good SPHE curriculum at the moment, but we want to make sure it is happening everywhere.  Other programmes have been introduced in recent years, in particular the lockers programme, which deals with cyberbullying and online bullying.  It is an extremely important Department of Education programme but there has been very little training rolled out for it so far.  If I was to say anything should happen from here, that should be the framework.  We must take a strategic approach to it.  That should be included in the review of the bullying procedures.  They were very good at the time, but a lot has changed since 2013.  All of that should be included and there should be an ongoing review.  We have a quality framework for schools at the moment and included in that is SPHE.  We have well-being guidelines that have been renewed again this year to 2021, which set out the importance of well-being and the health of students.  There is a really good opportunity but the missing piece for me has been the quality standards and quality training that we need to provide in continuing professional development, CPD, for teachers in particular and for school leaders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>The only point that would concern me and perhaps someone else would address it, is even in what Ms O'Dwyer is talking about in that there so much bureaucracy and so much more to be done in what Mr. Curtis described in his statement as highly stressed environments.

I cannot come up with better language, but I wonder about the lexicon we use when we discuss behavioural issues.<\/p> <p>  We need to train people, which is where we are falling down.  We have taken our eye off the ball a little in the context of how we engage professionally and ask people to go into social, personal and health education, SPHE, classes.  That is a major issue.  The Deputy is correct about the bureaucracy.  We want to be careful in this regard.  The best resource one can give a school is to allow a principal a little leeway where a couple of hours are left over.  By and large, principals are able to identify the people at school level who might be best suited to work as a form teacher with a first year class, who has a certain level of empathy, etc.<\/p> <p>  We are still flailing around a little in terms of research into what the best programmes are.

Deputy Conway-Walsh and others have discussed measuring.  Why are we having this conversation?  Is it a part of ongoing good practice in how we look after our physical and mental health or, from the experience of Ms O'Dwyer and the others, do they have reason to believe that the situation is worse than it used to be?  With all of the emphasis on positive mental health and the nurturing that is now part of school life compared with when I was at school, one would hope that the situation would be much better.  To quote U2, \"Is it getting better?  Or do you feel the same?\"  Is it worse than it was ten or 20 years ago?  I would be grateful for our guests' thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  I will focus my next question on the Catholic school patronage and management sector.  Is there much politics influencing this debate?  We hear so much about sexual issues, to be blunt, when talking about bullying.  This committee has had relatively little conversation about race or ethnic-based bullying or people being bullied on the basis of perceptions about their religions or religious practice.  We have had some focus on disability-based bullying.  All bullying is equally wrong, but are there issues?  In the JMB's presentation, it focused on cyberbullying and homophobic and transphobic bullying, cyberbullying being a means of bullying that we all need to discuss.  However, is there evidence to suggest that bullying around sexual identity issues is a much bigger problem than bullying based on, for example, rivalries between children or has it to do with the prevalence of groups that are active in these issues?  Is there a disproportionate focus that might be subtracting from our need to concentrate on the essence of what is causing bullying?<\/p> <p>  Our society is now more liberal and an element in it is hostile to faith.  Do children encounter bullying based on their faith or religious practice?  Is there any evidence of that?<\/p> <p>  Do we need to focus more on resilience?  Sometimes, I worry that we talk so much about this problem that we are putting children into a victim mode.  Are we saying enough about the need to strengthen, encourage and cajole parents to be more active in their parenting and about the promotion of resilience in children so that they are less a target for bullying and better able to deal with it when it comes over the horizon?<\/p> <p>  I am sorry for asking so many questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#H00600","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Did the Senator wish to direct them to anyone in particular or will I put them to all of the witnesses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#H00700","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I am happy for people to pull from the pie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#H00800","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":537,"content":"<p>As to whether things are more difficult for students than they used to be, schools are much kinder places, and they become even kinder every year.  We are focused on the fundamentals of our mission and challenge, namely, to look after the kids the best we can.  Nonetheless, children are living in a much more difficult space.  They lack the community support of previous years.  I often think of the old adage, &quot;It takes a village to raise a child&quot;.  The situation has changed in that respect.  That is why schools are so important.  They give communities to students and a sense of differentiation.  Students meet different kinds of characters and people.  Today is a more challenging environment for children to grow up in, so schools are more important than ever in that regard.  We must keep ensuring that they are kind places.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the types of bullying that we see in schools, there is no pattern <i>per se<\/i>.  We see bullying in all guises.  It can be transphobic, homophobic or because Johnny has red hair.  Children are children and we must realise that, by their nature, they will do childish things.  It is our job to try to educate them.  They pick up on what is in the media and what is happening in wider society.  I would hate to think that there was faith-based bullying in any of our schools.  The majority of our schools are faith schools and we try to have an inclusive culture wherein we look after everyone.  That is a fundamental part of our mission.<br\/><br\/>The question about coping skills was apt.  It is a challenge for us.  We deal with cases on occasion.  What is one child's bullying is another child's banter.  Perhaps children do not innately have the same skill level in those arenas now that they might have had hitherto.  Perhaps that is because families are smaller, they have fewer social outlets or more of their social outlets are online.  It is challenging.  We must bear in mind that this is part of the package.  Resilience is a major issue.  We are trying to equip kids with the social skills to manage these situations and set them up for life.  In some respects, what worries me most is that the kids with problems in school whom we deal with are often the ones who do not have problems later in life.  That is because they have a focus or spotlight placed on them.<\/p><p> The children I worry about are the second-tier children who do not come to the forefront in school.  Often, they are the ones who go on to have problems, especially young men in their 20s and the mental health issues that arise for them.  I saw some surveys recently showing that, at third level, there is an increase in people presenting with mental health issues.  I am always worried about the people who are under the radar in schools.  What are we doing for them?  Are we preparing them for life after school, when they will perhaps not have the supports they need?  I always have that ongoing concern because I have seen some sad cases involving young men in their 20s.  I worry about what we should be doing for them.  It is often not necessarily the children who come to attention in school who suffer after they leave.  We have much to think about, reflect on and work on in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I endorse everything Mr. Curtis said.  Schools have become much more sensitive to bullying.  Physical bullying, for example, has decreased, but I believe cyberbullying has increased.  If we look internationally, there seems to be a deterioration in young people's mental health, starting approximately in 2012.  Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist in the United States, has done some really interesting work in this area.  He attributes the problem to the increased use of social media and overly protective parenting.  We are, in effect, bubble-wrapping children when they are young, which means they are not getting access to the kinds of experiences that allow them to test their limits.  We are not allowing them to be a little bit reckless and find out what works and does not work.<\/p> <p>  We are even seeing that happening in schools.  We came across a school recently that had stopped children running in the playground.  The school told the parents it was to do with insurance.  When we chatted with management, it turned out there had been one complaint by a parent when a child had fallen.  Children are going to fall.  If we stop them from falling, it is not good for them.  They need to learn their own limits.  These factors are feeding into a more challenging situation for schools.  Some of the challenge for society is that schools can do so much but we need the rest of society to realise these trends are occurring and try to finds means of addressing them outside the school environment as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I agree completely with what Mr. Curtis and Mr. Mulconry said.  Building resilience is the role of the school, of course, but also, clearly, the role of the family and wider community.  There need to be opportunities to build resilience.  If any of us look back and consider what built our own resilience, it was all the relationships we had since we were young children.  The school can do as much as it can but I would love to see far more happening for parents, particularly in the early years.  There are some excellent parenting programmes such as the Incredible Years programme, which Mr. Mulconry mentioned is available in some of his schools.  There is also the Parents Plus programme, which was developed in the Mater hospital.  I would love to see those courses happening in a community context to give parents the skills needed.  It is a challenging space for parents.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the types of bullying, the one that is most common at this time, particularly in terms of cyberbullying, is bullying that relates to sexual matters.  We have discovered over the past number of years that, during the summer months, there is obviously far more online activity and issues then come into the school in September.  Parents may not be aware of some of the online bullying and activity and it all comes to the surface when children return to school.  They are fearful of different things and they disclose to the school, which then has to deal with it.  That raises the issue of what we are doing to prepare and support children in advance of summer holidays.  The same issue arose online when we were in lockdown.  Certainly, it increased that type of activity because people had more online time.  This is an area in which we need to do far more work with students of all ages to prepare them, prevent problems from happening and deal with them if they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I have a few questions and points for the witnesses.  I am really struck by the breadth of wisdom and experience they have brought to the discussion today.  Hearing about the very positive work that is happening is helpful.  I agree that we need to have a sharing of that excellent work and the ability to bring it to different schools.  Ms O'Dwyer mentioned the Incredible Years programme.  It is a great programme but it is unfortunate that only DEIS schools are able to participate.  There are many children in non-DEIS schools who would really benefit from it.  We need to roll out all of these programmes to all schools if we are to benefit all the children who need them.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mulconry talked about children not playing as much as they would have done in the past.  He is right about that.  We need to look at informal methods of education, such as through play and leisure activities.  While I realise this is outside the school sphere to a certain extent, it brings it back to the community approach.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by Mr. Curtis's comments on the issues with language and the fact we talk about anti-bullying policies as opposed to trying to couch things in a more positive light.  We should be talking in terms of resilience, positive mental health and developing positive relationships with others.  There is a lot to consider and learn in this regard.  I really enjoyed the philosophical thoughts behind the engagement we have had today.<\/p> <p>  I have a few queries for the witnesses.  When discussing cyberbullying at previous hearings, and it is something we touched on today, we have spoken about the role an online safety commissioner could play.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions on how such a commissioner could be empowered to tackle cyberbullying?  We all agree this is an issue.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Dwyer spoke about the roadmap of supports to be developed by ETBI.  All the witnesses spoke about the difficulties in terms of schools and teachers accessing relevant resources.  I agree that supporting professional development for teachers and in whole-school communities is hugely important.  The Ombudsman for Children has spoken at the committee about the need for every school not necessarily to have its own counsellor but to have access to a counsellor.  That also provides a supporting element for teachers.<\/p> <p>  At our second-last meeting, several witnesses raised the point that the Department does not gather aggregate data on bullying, including the number of bullying incidents, the types of incidents and the measures taken to address them.  Do the witnesses think such data would be helpful?<\/p> <p>  My final point is more a comment than a question.  We have had discussions in the committee on the issue of restorative justice.  I consider it an incredible tool.  We had a really strong submission from a former principal, Ms Noreen Duggan, on her experience in teaching.  She is undertaking further study on the subject.  There is a lot in this area that is absolutely key to what we are trying to do and I expect it to form a large part of our report.<\/p> <p>  I will go to Ms O'Dwyer first to respond to the points I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#J00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I will talk about the roadmap.  An issue we have not mentioned today is the student support team role in schools, which particularly addresses mental health issues, whether they are caused by bullying or otherwise.  The student support team model was introduced four or five years ago to help vulnerable children and there are pilots happening throughout the country.  We have engaged with NEPS on this and we are working with it to provide training for all schools in County Kerry, both ETB schools and non-ETB schools.<\/p><p>We have noticed over the past four years, since we introduced this training programme of three full days for everybody on the student support scheme, that the feedback from schools is it has made a very big impact, particularly in dealing with the most vulnerable of our students.  These students have been victims of bullying in some cases and they are very vulnerable for many reasons.  It is the few students rather than the many.  I would like to see that as part of the roadmap to be rolled out very clearly.<\/p><p> The most significant feature of this process is the relationship built between NEPS and schools and that two-way relationship should improve.  There is also a relationship with CAMHS and with Tusla and its mental health programme, as well as Tusla's child protection section.  Where there is a Jigsaw programme available, that group is involved as well.  There is a steering committee for managing and delivering the programme representing all the agencies.  The relationship built between the school and those agencies clarifies the role and function of student support schemes and it clarifies the appropriate referral pathways for students.  It also clarifies the boundaries of student support teams, including what the school can do and what the school should not be involved in.  It is one element of the roadmap and we must ensure that in the next three to five years, that training is provided for every student support team.  It is a cyclical programme because there will be changes in staff.<\/p><p> There are at least two if not three therapies that schools should be able to access.  One is therapeutic counselling for students who need it and the student support team will be the group in school that will make that referral.  The other two therapies to which schools need access fairly immediately are occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  Occupational therapy is particularly relevant to all our schools.  For example, we have nine special classes across schools and many students are suffering from anxiety and mental health issues.  Occupational therapists can work side by side with a teacher and there is a pilot under way in Kildare, Wicklow and Dublin that we are all reading about, as a report was compiled last September.  That process should certainly be rolled out across the country.  We should have access to therapy in the school, with occupational and speech and language therapists working side by side with teachers and with schools reinforcing those therapies such as behaviour management, where students can learn to manage their own behaviour, particularly those students suffering from anxiety.<\/p><p> I would like to see these two elements as clear parts of the roadmap, along with what I mentioned earlier regarding the training for SPHE teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":544,"content":"<p>As Ms O'Dwyer has said, we have all heard about the pilot and it sounds fantastic but there is no sign of it arriving to other schools.  There is a real and urgent need for it.  If a Minister with responsibility for finance or education makes an announcement at budget time, he or she always speaks about the increased number of special needs assistants, SNAs, but we also need occupational therapists and other supports just as much at this stage, if not more than SNAs.  I certainly back that point.<\/p> <p>  On the question of statistics, the first question asked by schools is what will be done with those statistics.  Much information is collected from schools but nothing ever happens to it.  There is a sense that it is a box-ticking exercise.  If we want to ask schools for statistics, we must tell them the reason and see that they will be used to drive policy rather than sitting on a shelf somewhere gathering dust.<\/p> <p>  On the question of an ombudsman or digital child protection officer, we must get the technology companies to formulate solutions rather than excuses.  We must get them to demonstrate what the technologies can do.  There have been major developments in artificial intelligence to recognise patterns across data and some of that could be used to track and identify bullying patterns at an early stage.  This could serve as the tripwire to bring about an intervention.  Much could be done but none of us knows as much about the technology as these firms do, so it is time somebody brought them into the conversation and held them to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>On the points made by Ms O'Dwyer and Mr. Mulconry, we have been calling for wrap-around services for pupils in our schools for a long time and we have those external supports to help people at the school level.

From my reading of the matter, three elements have been mentioned.<\/p> <p>  A safety commissioner would be very significant.  I suppose the big issue we have is chasing technology companies about the right to erasure and information that is held online.  Perhaps we could even have a point of quick contact.

There is much work that could be done.<\/p> <p>  I am a bit conflicted on the question of data and I go back to the question of language and the number of bullying cases.

I do not have an answer, by the way, although I have been thinking for the past few days about what other type of language would be used.  It is a difficult space but we must all reflect on this while being as positive as we can about the environments that comprise our schools now in order that we can build on that.

We need other drills and I really like the Vice Chairman's use of the word \"resilience\" over the likes of \"anti-bullying\".  Maybe we could have resilience drills in schools so people know what their roles are if they see something happen.  I am very concerned we do not speak about this in schools and people do not know how to act when they see this happening.  If we have such drills, the culture in school might change and students would feel more empowered to act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#K00600","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>In the context of post-primary schools and the kids we deal with, the big telltale sign in early days relates to groups and who is not in a group.  Students tend to be creatures of habit.  They walk the same ways, sit in the same places and congregate around the same lockers.  We can see quite quickly, in the first couple of weeks, which first-year students do not seem to hang out with anybody else, for want of a better phrase.<\/p><p>One should have good people keeping an eye on that.  One will always have an intuitive sense of where the problems might be.  Prevention is better than cure in that one should get in quickly enough, have a quick chat with the child and, if necessary, have a little conversation with the parent.  One should watch the dynamics of movement and engagement.  That is the first telltale sign one sees, that is, who is hanging out with whom and which children are on their own and are isolated.<\/p><p> One will find that many pupils lack the social skills to be able to engage with other children, especially in the early days of coming into school, because there is so much going on.  We can be proactive in much of what we do.  However, it necessitates a little bit of manpower, having people watch out for it and identifying people at school level who have the skills in those arenas.  Those are the subtle things one watches out for.<\/p><p> We all have to deal with the very overt bullying cases.  One thing that I found useful was that it was explained to me that about 2% of people &ndash; adults and children - do not have empathy.  These are people who do not feel the feelings of others.  It is very hard to develop social skills there.  Those are the children one needs to work on as well.  One should be aware that in any given school there is a number of children who just do not get it when it comes to proper social etiquette.  Again, it is about trying to identify early on who those children might be in any given year and any given class and intervening and helping as much as possible.  That can be very difficult because oftentimes the impasse can be with parents in that arena.  No parent wants their child to be called a bully, or to be accused of bullying or insensitive behaviour.  That is where the difficulties are.<\/p><p> Much of this is about awareness.  When I say that we have taken our eye off the ball, I do not mean this in any pejorative sense.  It has been a number of years since we have looked at the bullying issue.  It is now time to re-engage, to reacquaint ourselves with what is going on and to try help the students as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Curtis.

One of them is certainly exclusion.  It can happen during the transition from primary to post-primary school.  It can also happen later on, when a student thinks they have a group of friends, and next thing they are excluded for whatever reason.  This is one of the most subtle and insidious forms of bullying and one of the most difficult and challenging.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of what we introduced around 2014, after the anti-bullying guidelines.  One of the schools produced a really good piece of theatre.  Students discussed it afterwards.  We were informed and inspired by the instructional leadership programme, where everything happens in groups.  Work is a really good methodology for teaching and learning in both primary and post-primary.  <\/p> <p>  When first years come in to schools, they form what we call a base group.  It is usually a heterogeneous group that is formed by the school management.  It is not a group of friends, but a group of people who do not know each other.  Therefore, in a class of 24, one would have six groups of four.  The social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum is taught using the groups of four.  The SPHE teacher teaches the SPHE curriculum, which is all about people minding themselves, who they are and their identity, how to be a friend, listening and communication.  All the social skills are learned in that group of four.  The student learns that they are going to take care of their group of four.  For instance, if anyone is away because they are unwell for a day, the other people in that group of four will give them a call or send a text, will send them the homework and when they come back, they will welcome them back.  It is about taking care of their group of four.<\/p> <p>  We have found that it is very unlikely that one group of four will bully another group of four or another individual in another group, because the group of four is learning to mind and support.  It is basic human kindness.  That is a very good model, based on Roger and David Johnson&rsquo;s co-operative learning approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021052500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Dwyer.

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  This is the second time during my tenure as general secretary of PDFORRA I have had the honour of addressing the committee.<\/p> <p>  PDFORRA represents in excess of 6,500 members of the Defence Forces.  This number represents one of the highest levels of representation as a percentage of workforce of any public service union in the State.  The association was founded in 1990 following a significant period of turmoil surrounding pay and allowances, which forced many personnel to leave at that time.  In recent times, the Defence Forces have encountered further difficulties with regard to pay and allowances resulting in another exodus of fine, young men and women who could not sustain a life within the Defence Forces based on the rates of pay and allowances on offer.  In an effort to stem the exodus, PDFORRA has engaged in every process and with every body it believed could make a difference and improve the lot of its members.  Regrettably, there has been a lack of engagement by various parties which has resulted in members of the association, in ever increasing numbers, turning to the courts system for relief.  Actions have been taken on foot of the breaches of the working time directive, freedom of association and freedom of assembly.<\/p><p>Additionally, legal actions have taken place regarding outstanding adjudications for members of the Army Ranger Wing, chefs and account holders, with papers recently being submitted on behalf of members to secure placement on the current senior non-commissioned officer's, SNCO's, course.  Further, this year, our association has highlighted some of these issues to external bodies, such as the International Labour Organization, ILO, and the European Committee of Social Rights, ECSR.<br\/><br\/>Over the course of the last year, PDFORRA has made submissions to the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces and the Pensions Commission, and a submission to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the issue of remote working.  Further, PDFORRA has continued its work and engagement on behalf of its members at conciliation council and at Defence Forces headquarters forum.<br\/><br\/>However, despite all of the foregoing work, returns to members have not been what we believed are necessary to sustain retention across the Defence Forces.  This can be exemplified by turnover figures across the defence organisation.  For example, the Naval Service now has as strength figure of just over 850 personnel.  Given numbers in training, the numbers of non-seagoing appointments across both commissioned and enlisted ranks, and the numbers of personnel who have completed sea-shore rotation, the number of personnel actually available to go to sea is extremely limited.<br\/><br\/>PDFORRA has for years advised our Department, military management and public representatives that there was no elasticity in the system  should a crisis arise.  The net result is the inability of State ships to go to sea.  In some instances, vessels worth tens of millions of euro are idle for lack of appropriately trained staff.<br\/><br\/>Specialist technicians within the Air Corps are also in short supply, with significant shortfalls in personnel across a wide spectrum of specialties.  This is feeding growing incidents of burnout and departure from this branch of the service.<br\/><br\/>The potential improvement in the economic situation, together with the lack of security of tenure and the lack of movement in technician pay will no doubt hasten the departure of more men and women in the short to medium term.<br\/><br\/>The Army also has significant difficulties with the retention of personnel.  Indicative of the trend in personnel leaving is the fact that in 2016 there were 44 sergeant vacancies within the Army.  This has now risen to 155 in 2021, with 267 vacancies across the whole organisation.<br\/><br\/>As PDFORRA highlighted previously, many of these vacancies are technicians, which take years to backfill as technicians have to qualify within both their trade and to the appropriate military rank.  However, there are multiple vacancies in the line streams also, with some units having significant shortfalls of sergeants and corporals.  All told, there would be in excess of 650 vacancies at corporal level, if all the sergeant vacancies were filled.  This, in an organisation as small as our Defence Forces, is an enormous shortfall.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing leads me to the following point.  The fact the Defence Forces has performed to the excellent level it has over the course of the pandemic is testament to the calibre of the men and women who populate its ranks.  As an association, PDFORRA is extremely proud of the contribution to the national effort made by all members during the past year.  They have shown themselves to be selfless, adaptable, resilient and capable of feats that surpass even the loftiest of expectations.  Great credit is also due to the families of members who have supported our personnel in their endeavours over the last year.<br\/><br\/>PDFORRA would also take this opportunity to place on record its recognition and appreciation of the dedicated voluntary work undertaken by many veterans across the country over the last year.  This pandemic will shortly be beaten.  The State and our Defence Forces will return to a normal operational tempo.  Our economy will improve.  Jobs will be created.  As a nation, we will again flourish.  What then will happen to the Defence Forces?  Will we as a nation forget the contribution made by these men and women or will we learn the valuable lesson that storms, pandemics and cyberattacks occur at the most inopportune moments?  Without appropriate investment into the resource that is the Defence Forces, we are liable to pay a heavy price for being unprepared.<br\/><br\/>While the work of Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces could not be more timely in terms of having a national emergency to test current structures and the responses of the Defence Forces, it must be remembered that recommendations from this body relating to pay allowances and systems must be discussed with PDFORRA in advance of the subsequent implementation.<br\/><br\/>The status of morale within the organisation is always difficult to judge but, currently, it fluctuates across the three services.  In many units, it is at a low ebb, due to the negative impact that the loss of personnel has had.  In other units, the desire to contribute to the national effort has a crystallising effect.<br\/><br\/>Regardless, PDFORRA and our personnel will always act in a professional manner in times of national crisis.  However, personnel are aware that the structural difficulties with pay, allowances, working time and contracts remain live issues.  Additionally, the contentious issue of the potential permanent pay review body, which has never been discussed with PDFORRA, is also on the horizon.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as possible within the timeframe permitted, I will address these issues in turn.  PDFORRA has seen it remarked that the starting pay of a member of Defence Forces is very good.  While it cannot be denied that the basic pay, including military service allowance, MSA, for a three star private at &euro;29,000 before tax is a significant sum of money for any young man or woman, it must be measured against the hours worked, exposure to danger, insecurity of tenure and the impact that military life has on family life and on budgets, notwithstanding the other vagaries of service.  Current pay structures within the Defence Forces have a narrow pay spine that reflects the hierarchical nature of our rank structure.  This pay spine is added to, with allowances that reflect specialties, such as trade and qualifications.  Additionally, due to the historic revulsion of establishing a system of overtime, which the general staff described as &ldquo;an anathema to military service&rdquo; to the Gleeson commission in 1990, other allowances have been added to reflect unique dangers and circumstances, such as explosive ordinance disposal, EOD, duty allowance for ordnance personnel and seagoing or patrol duty allowance to induce personnel to go to sea.  The foregoing factors have resulted in a complex pay structure, which was described as such by the Gleeson commission.<br\/><br\/>PDFORRA has made numerous recommendations to the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces in this area of pay structures.  The association has not made recommendations on pay rates, as this falls outside of the scope of the terms of reference.  There can be no doubt that current pay structures need to be revised.  However, it must be remembered that the complexity of the role and function of the Defence Forces has not altered considerably since the Gleeson commission reported and changes should not be made only in the hope that they will turn things around.  Sometimes even small changes, which are believed might have a positive effect, can have adverse consequences for years afterwards.<br\/><br\/>Previously, members of the Defence Forces, like other public servants, enjoyed certain benefits associated with public service: guaranteed pay and pensions, security of tenure until pension age and protection against dismissal.  These benefits were contrasted against private sector employment by prospective employees, which while generally better paying, had less stability.  These factors, when compared and taking due cognisance of the economic circumstances prevailing, made public service a credible prospect.  However, since 1990, the benefits previously associated with public service generally have become relatively mainstream with the advent of, among other things, the Payment of Wages Act, the National Minimum Wage Act, and the Unfair Dismissals Act.  These legislative provisions, in essence, have diminished the attractiveness of life in the Defence Forces, which necessitates a particular calibre of person in any event.<br\/><br\/>Rates of pay generally are a product of pay provided divided by time spent at work.  What has not helped the Defence Forces over the past few years is the lack of any formal working time agreement, with members working extensive hours for rates of pay that are more appropriate for flat hours which is not the norm in the Defence Forces.  PDFORRA recognised the causal link between the levels of disenfranchisement with pay and working time many years ago.  However, the opportunity to address this was clouded in the absence of precedent on the issue of working time from the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU.<br\/><br\/>In 2013, PDFORRA submitted a claim for holiday pay through the conciliation and arbitration scheme, on the foot of the CJEU ruling in the case of Williams and Others <i>v.<\/i>British Airways.  Following the submission of the claim, it was found that members of the Defence Forces had an entitlement to holiday pay, which was paid in arrears to 2009.  Subsequently, following the exchange of extensive correspondence with the Department, PDFORRA initiated a claim on behalf of Ms Susan O&rsquo;Donnell for the amendment of Defence Forces regulation A.11, dealing with leave.  This claim sought to provide for carryover leave in appropriate circumstances arising from the Schultz-Hoff judgment.<\/p><p>This claim was settled on the steps of the court, as one might say, with the amendment of regulation A.11.  Thereafter, following an extensive exchange of correspondence, PDFORRA again initiated legal action in multiple cases for breach of the working time directive.  These claims were subsequently settled in 2019 following a mediated settlement.<br\/><br\/>The common thread running through the majority of these issues is the marked reluctance to engage through the conciliation and arbitration process and final settlement at court.  This, as I told the committee in 2019, has a demoralising effect, as PDFORRA must go through the conciliation and arbitration process in order to be successful in a court action.  Meanwhile, members are frustrated at the apparent lack of progress while claims are processed.  At present, PDFORRA is in the process of preparing multiple court actions due to the failure to secure agreement on basic rights-based issues.<br\/><br\/>A similar situation arises in the context of contracts.  In 2019, PDFORRA informed the committee that the issue of contract terms for post-1994 personnel needed attention.  To date, regrettably, enlisted personnel do not have the clarity needed on their upper service limits.  This will cause irreparable harm the longer it remains unresolved, with members rightly feeling a lack of reciprocated loyalty.  It makes no sense to discharge compulsorily personnel who are experienced, capable and medically fit to perform the duties required of them.  PDFORRA raised this important issue with the Minister yesterday, who informed us that an interim report should be available in mid-June or July.<br\/><br\/>I want to address the issue of ICTU affiliation.  In 2014, PDFORRA submitted a complaint to the European Committee of Social Rights alleging breaches of Articles 5 and 6 of the European Social Charter.  These complaints were upheld unanimously by the committee in early 2018.  In late 2018, PDFORRA was asked to engage with Mr. Gerard Barry, who was asked to carry out a review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme with the inclusion of ICTU affiliation in his terms of reference.  This was undertaken in good faith by PDFORRA.  Mr. Barry recommended that discussions take place between officials of the Department, ICTU and PDFORRA.  PDFORRA engaged with all sides, as recommended.  Following this, certain assurances were sought by management from PDFORRA.  These were subsequently provided.<br\/><br\/>On 1 February 2020, prior to the general election, Deputy Leo Varadkar, then Taoiseach, was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>as having said that PDFORRA should be permitted to affiliate to ICTU.  Our association and membership were extremely pleased by his remarks and believed our hard fought case for affiliation would finally be recognised.  However, subsequent to discussions between the coalition partners, PDFORRA discovered that establishment of a permanent pay review body was proposed.  This body was never requested by PDFORRA.  Moreover, our association, having viewed the results from the armed forces pay review body in Britain, believes that the establishment of such a body would be counterproductive and give rise to even greater problems in time.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, it must be considered that the programme for Government commits such a body to act in compliance with the public sector pay policy.  This would result in a situation where the representative bodies would be subject to a policy that they have no prospect of influencing.  Further, PDFORRA believes such a policy would be inconsistent with our obligations under the European Social Charter and in direct contravention of the recent recommendations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has stated that bodies such as ours should be allowed to associate with umbrella groups.  PDFORRA has repeatedly asked the Minister to explain how such a body can meet the aforementioned obligations under international treaties and conventions while still conforming to public sector pay policy.  We have yet to receive clarity on these points.  Repeated pronouncements about the unique nature of the Defence Forces being recognised do little to provide any illumination on the subject.  Our members deserve clarity and should be able to expect that findings from bodies such as the social rights committee would be honoured.<br\/><br\/>People who assert that in the event of a strike, members of the Defence Forces may refuse to cross picket lines would do well to reacquaint themselves with section 131 of the Defence Act 1954 and the obligations on members to obey all lawful orders . Additionally, persons who say that in the event that our members cross picket lines we would be punished by ICTU at subsequent pay talks should consider that members have received little, if anything, beyond basic deals in the past ten years in any event.  Furthermore, it must be remembered that all public sector unions have provisions for minimum cover during strikes.  It must be considered that PDFORRA has provided numerous saving caveats to the Minister through the Department in response to the foregoing perceived fears.  In the foregoing respect, PDFORRA members view ourselves as the thin end of the wedge who could be used as a model to reduce workers' rights and sow discord across the public service.<br\/><br\/>As pointed out earlier, failure to keep pace with movements in pay, legislation and societal norms will result in the Defence Forces falling further and further behind in terms of recruiting and retaining personnel.  It is long past time to stop the rot.  It is time to look to the future and embrace the prospect of modern work practices and a modern Defence Forces that provide our State and its citizens with the protections they need and deserve.  While PDFORRA may not necessarily agree with his cause, it is easy to concur with the sentiments of General &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson when he said, &quot;The patriot volunteer, fighting for country and his rights, makes the most reliable soldier on earth&quot;.

I am also a director of the PDFORRA medical assistance scheme, which was established by our organisation in 2018 to assist injured members in the Defence Forces to seek access to medical treatment and remain in service.  The rationale behind setting up such a scheme was that a number of people were being discharged from the Defence Forces while waiting for treatment in the public health service.<\/p> <p>  The scheme has been extremely successful, with 3,000 members enrolled in it of whom 274 have received access to treatment, the vast majority in a hospital in Belfast under the terms of the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme.  The medical assistance scheme was established under the terms of the EU cross-border healthcare directive, which has ended in Northern Ireland since Brexit and the Government has put in place the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme until December 2021.<\/p> <p>  The medical support scheme has been a fantastic benefit to our members who receive treatment speedily.  Many of our members have told us they went on to get promoted, remain in service, avoid medical discharge and continue in their careers.  In many cases, they have served overseas.  We want to take the scheme to the next level and we hope to roll it out to family members.  This would be just and deserved as the families of Defence Forces members contribute an awful lot while we are engaged in military service.  This is our plan.  To do so we need the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme to continue beyond December 2021 and we need support from the Department to continue to professionalise and take on staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Quigley"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quigley.

My colleagues spoke on a number of issues.  I would like to address issues affecting the Naval Service.  The three main issues we are facing at the moment are the patrol duty allowance, the retention payment scheme and accommodation.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the development in Haulbowline of Block 8, which has started at long last.  Unfortunately, this will not be enough in itself.  We believe more accommodation will be needed within the naval base at Haulbowline if we are to future-proof the Naval Service and build for the future.  As the general secretary outlined at the start, there is currently a shortage of 300 personnel.  If recruitment of personnel takes place accommodation will be needed for those people.  We also feel the non-provision of a rent allowance to our members in the Defence Forces prohibits them from competing in the private rental sector and seeking mortgages to provide their own property.  <\/p> <p>  While we welcomed the announcement of the sea service retention scheme by the Minister, unfortunately, this scheme has proven to be flawed.  It will not address our concerns or those of our members.  It has created a two-tier Naval Service in which personnel with less than three years serving afloat endure the same hardship as other members with more than three years' service.  In addition, the failure to address the issue surrounding patrol duty allowance for our members is very much to the forefront of their concerns. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I will now go to members of the committee for questions and observations.

I thank the witnesses for attending our meeting this afternoon.  It is hugely important.  I thank them for all their work on very important and serious issues affecting our Defence Forces.  I commend them on all the work they have engaged on over the last number of years.<\/p> <p>  I will hone in on a couple of points.  Mr. Guinan referred to affiliation with ICTU, which my party and I fully support.  It is something that should happen.  Examples have been given of other defence forces and armies across Europe and beyond, which have rights to affiliate with unions.  It should also happen in Ireland.  I have raised this a number of times with the Minister.  He has not said \"No\" but has refrained from making more detailed commentary as he is aware of legal issues going on in the background.  Can our witnesses give an update on how things are progressing in terms of engagement with the Minister on that issue?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Guinan also mentioned the pay review body and the fact there was absolutely zero consultation with PDFORRA regarding its establishment.  Do Mr. Guinan or the other witnesses think PDFORRA has the ability to work?  Is it a mechanism or body that should be made redundant and ICTU affiliation made the primary focus instead?  I ask for a view on that.<\/p> <p>  I will also touch on the 1994 contract because, certainly during my engagement with members of the Defence Forces, it is an issue that keeps cropping up and has serious consequences.  We see members of the Defence Forces joining in their late teens and then forced out, possibly in their late 30s, because of these contracts.  The contracts are acting as a massive impediment and adding to the major retention issue within the Defence Forces.  We see the impact of the 1994 contracts in terms of the inability of young families to take out mortgages.  I raised this previously with the Minister.  I hope I correctly heard what Mr. Guinan said about an interim report.  He might go into a little more detail about it because I have previously asked the Minister about the possibility of changing those contracts.  Can we get a little more detail on that?<\/p> <p>  On issues relating to the contracts, it is my understanding limited assistance is offered to personnel intending to leave the Defence Forces or preparing for civilian life.  The State has a duty of service to assist personnel who have given extended service to their country's defence in the transition from military to civilian life.  What impact would securing the appointment of dedicated personnel, who could operate in the guise of vocational advisers, to prepare members of the Defence Forces with the necessary skills required to find employment in civilian life, recognise the skills they may have developed within the Defence Forces and learn to transfer them to the labour market?  Can PDFORRA see the value in such a role?<\/p> <p>  I will ask about the technical pay review.  The issue of cybersecurity has dominated the airwaves over the past week or so, as has the ability of foreign-based criminals to launch an attack on the HSE computer system.  We are still seeing the fall-out and repercussions from that.  While I do not want to ask about the issue specifically as it is beyond our remit today, it is an inescapable fact that the failure of the Government to adequately deal with the technical pay review is impacting on recruitment and retention of Defence Forces personnel in key skill units, such as those charged with dealing with cybersecurity.  This is linked to the wider recruitment and retention issue within the Defence Forces as a whole.  <\/p> <p>  According to figures furnished by the Minister, despite a focus on recruitment the standing strength of the Defence Forces has continued to fall and further decreased from 2019 to 2020.  That issue is particularly felt within the Naval Service, which has seen a 40% reduction in naval patrols since 2018.  That is primarily due to the fact that the Naval Service lacks the personnel to crew vessels.  Within the same time period, we saw a 12% drop in the number of personnel being inducted into the service.  I ask the witnesses to comment on this wider issue of difficulty in recruitment and retention, particularly in those highly-skilled units.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on the medical assistance scheme.  I ask our witnesses to give a bit more detail on the PDFORRA medical assistance scheme.  It appears that PDFORRA had to step in to provide a service to members of the Defence Forces that really should be the responsibility of the Government.  Can the witnesses give some detail or background to that?  I will leave it at that.  I again thank our witnesses for their presentation to the committee and their ongoing work in representing members of the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#D00300","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I thank our guests this morning.  As always, it is a pleasure to hear from PDFORRA.  I also want to extend my sympathy to Mr. Bright and his family for their loss.  I offer my genuine condolences.  I was very sorry to hear that.<\/p> <p>  In relation to both serving members of the Defence Forces and veterans, is PDFORRA experiencing what my constituency team and I are experiencing in terms of the impact of the housing crisis on members?  It is not an exaggeration to say that in recent months, we have been inundated with queries and requests for help and guidance from serving members and veterans who are living in a nightmarish situation.  The end of the moratorium on evictions seems to have coincided with increase-in-rent notices coming in the door.  What we see to a greater extent is that serving members are taking on extra employment to a higher degree than would have been the case beforehand.  This is not to supplement luxuries but to simply make the rent payments.<\/p> <p>  Whether it is to do with red tape or anomalies, I also have noticed an issue with serving members and their wives, husbands and partners.  If the latter's employer has been in receipt of the wage subsidy scheme payment, it is now having an impact on their ability to draw down a mortgage.  There were four such cases last week alone.  This is something which if witnesses are not aware of, I would like to speak to them about outside of this setting.  It is an issue which is there.  There is also the issue of additional notices to quit, which have been coming in over recent months, the contraction of the rental market and its impact on serving members and veterans.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the statement made earlier that &euro;29,000 before tax is not a bad starting-off wage.  The question which is key and must be asked is whether it is reflective of that nature of the role.  That is the key question which must be asked when one is looking at entry-level wages of the Defence Forces.  We have seen and heard the various advertisements that have been placed, in print, broadcast and online forms, to encourage the recruitment drive.  In the witnesses&rsquo; professional experience and as representatives of PDFORRA, what more must happen to attract recruits into a career in the Defence Forces?  What more must we do to make this an attractive career for more people? <\/p> <p>  I want to touch briefly on the issues of contract and the 21-year service date, and the catastrophic effect that has in some areas on morale.  I understand that cliff edge is approaching.  If July 2021 is the date the Minister has set out, do witnesses think the timeframe is sufficient to calm current members' fears?  I will give an example of why it is an issue.  Yesterday, I spoke to a retired member of the Defence Forces.  He was 43 years of age.  That is hardly an age one would consider to be retired at, but he was retired and he was 43 years of age.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the Minister stated at this committee that some areas of the defence budget, which will not be spent, will be ring-fenced for the wider defence family.  From PDFORRA&rsquo;s perspective, what do witnesses think would be the best use of those funds?  What would deliver most for their 6,500 members?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Quigley for bringing up the medical assistance programme.  I could not help but notice the display he has behind his head.  I had a quick look at his website to see what kind of injuries this scheme is used for.  What I saw were predominantly knee and hip injuries.  Does Mr. Quigley have figures as to the extent to which the job has an impact on those injuries?  Were they caused by playing five-a-side football or were they as a result of the role members perform?  Last week, members heard the provision in the Estimate for the Defence Forces for litigation is going to increase.  It will remain the same for medical and there will be no material increase in compensation.  Does PDFORRA agree with a statement that was made to me that the Department now seems determined to defend any and all claims to the fullest extent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#E00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":574,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues, I extend my sympathies to the Bright family.

The president, Mr. Keane, spoke about the two-tier service.  At the weekend, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>carried a story about Tadhg McCarthy who had left the Naval Service after 24 years.  He was an engine room artificer.  In some ways, the story was very sad.  Here we have a guy who loved the job he was in but left because as the numbers fall, the work commitment for individual members within the service grows.  I am interested in what Mr. Keane will say about that.<\/p><p>My second question, which is for Mr. Guinan, is about the vacancies of non-commissioned officers, NCOs.  There are 650 NCOs throughout the forces.  That is unbelievable.  I am interested to hear Mr. Guinan&rsquo;s comments on that.<\/p><p>On the issue of abatement, I know it is something which happens after people leave the service.  Many of PDFORRA&lsquo;s members leave because of the contract.  They leave and are subsequently re-employed in other parts of the public service, including into the military, and their pensions are abated.  I am interested in PDFORRA&rsquo;s view on this.  I appreciate it does not come under its terms of reference.  However, people who have gone to jail and had their pensions taken off them, have had their pension restored because the courts have upheld that a pension is a property right.  As a property right under the Constitution, it cannot be touched.  I find it repugnant that people who have given service to the State have had their pensions taken off them by way of abatement, if they go back into the public service. <\/p><p>Mr. Quigley is a member of the national executive.  I must congratulate him on the medical assistance scheme.  I hope his colleagues do not mind but I think this scheme is his.  He drove it the whole way and he made it the great success that it is for members of the Defence Forces.  As Mr. Quigley moves forward, families will be included and the system will be grown even more to provide a much better service.  It is somewhat heartbreaking that members must go to Belfast and other parts of the United Kingdom for treatment, but who cares, Mr. Quigley is getting them there and getting them back into fit service immediately.  He is doing this on a part-time basis as far as I am aware.  Perhaps it is unfair to ask him but should this be a fully seconded position subvented by the Department of Defence in order to deliver the type of service which I know he delivers in his spare time?  Do we need someone to do this full time?<\/p><p>There are many other things I could ask the witnesses about.  A key issue which has come to my attention is rare enough in the Defence Forces, but I am interested in Mr. Guinan&rsquo;s answer.  It relates to the issuing of passports to members of the Defence Forces.  As we are a multinational country, people who moved into the country during the last 20 years and who joined the Defence Forces are not entitled to a passport.  This is unlike any other military organisation that I am aware of.  If they want one, they must qualify as citizens first and then pay &euro;1,000 to go through the process.  To me, that seems extremely cruel to the people who are prepared to give their time to the State.  I could go on but I am sure my colleague, Deputy Berry, will have plenty to say.  I will ease off at this stage.<\/p><p>I should say to Mr. Keane, the president, Mr. Guinan, the general secretary, and Mr. Quigley, who is speaking on behalf of his executive colleagues, that this country owes them a great deal for what they have done throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  The pandemic brought into sharp focus the massive commitment their members deliver not just today but every day.  If there was a requirement in the morning for them to go the extra mile and do something else while working on Covid-19, like they moved very quickly from creating test centres to erecting vaccination centres as well as delivering personal protection equipment, PPE, throughout the country, they would still do the normal duties that are required of them every day of the week.  This country owes them a massive debt of gratitude.  I am afraid that flattery is all they get, but flattery does not put dinner on tables.  I personally thank them.  Having been a former colleague, I understand what their members are going through.  I also thank the witnesses for their presentation today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#E00500","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Senator Craughwell referred to Deputy Berry.

I also wish to convey my sincere sympathies to the Bright family.  I ask the witnesses to convey to their members the huge amount of appreciation and gratitude we have for all their hard work, particularly over the last 15 months on the pandemic and in the last few weeks in respect of the cyberattack.  The country would be lost without them.  I also thank the witnesses for their detailed opening statement.  It makes quite rough reading, to be honest.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on one key point mentioned, which is very honest, blunt and frank.  It is about the Naval Service.  The witness said that the net result is the inability of State ships to go to sea, and in some instances vessels worth tens of millions of euro are idle due to the lack of appropriately trained staff.  That is a sad indictment of the position of the Naval Service.  There is a ministerial and departmental responsibility for this, but there is also a responsibility on this committee.  We are the parliamentary oversight committee and this is occurring on our watch.  Our job is to forensically analyse the performance of the defence apparatus in this country.  I do not take my responsibilities lightly in this regard and it is something on which we should focus.  Our job as a cross-governmental, inter-party committee is to put forward solutions.  My question to Mr. Keane or Mr. Guinan is: how do we solve the Naval Service issue?  Mr. Keane articulated the dual-tier pay system in the Naval Service.  One must have three years service in the Naval Service before one is eligible to apply for the sea-going service commitment scheme.  What if that caveat were removed?  If every member of the Naval Service were entitled to at least apply for the sea-going commitment scheme, would that make a difference from a retention point of view?  That is the first question.<\/p> <p>  My second question is probably for Mr. Guinan and relates to his comment about lack of movement on technician pay.  I was following Twitter last night and I noticed the Minister issued a statement.  I believe there might have been considerable movement in the last 24 hours.  The timing before this meeting today is, I presume, totally coincidental, but we will take whatever is going.  Perhaps Mr. Guinan would outline to the committee what the current position is with that issue.  Does he have confidence?  We have had announcements in this regard in the past, so is he confident that the announcement will be delivered on this time, unlike two years ago when it was announced initially?<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that in the interests of brevity for the first round.

We initiated legal action last year arising from the pronouncement that we were going to have a pay review body.  If we did not do that, the pay review body could be there and then one could be initiating legal action.  We were never asked about a pay review body.  PDFORRA had mooted the prospect of a pay review body - an independent once-off commission similar to the Gleeson commission to try to re-establish the relativities between Defence Forces pay and wider public sector pay.  That is what we want.  We believe there is a need to re-establish that link in relativities between public sector pay and Defence Forces pay.  It has been broken over the years.<br\/><br\/>We believe that membership of ICTU provides us with the greatest opportunity to provide the public services committee of ICTU with the information that it needs to be able to grant or accede to the pay demands that are necessary.  Pay negotiations in this country are conducted centrally by means of collective bargaining.  In circumstances where the primary partners at the centre of those discussions, the public services committee of ICTU and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, do not know the concerns or issues involved in one's pay they do not make allowances for it.  Then one is an afterthought, and one is trying to unwind pay agreements that are set in place.  It is not good enough.<br\/><br\/>That leads on to the proposition that a pay review body will resolve all our problems.  If one looks at the terms of reference of the armed forces pay review body in England, one sees it is subject to public sector pay policy.  The Commission on the Defence Forces and the Public Service Pay Commission last year were subject to public sector pay policy.  That does not provide the ability to explore the details that must be addressed in order to mitigate the problems that exist within the organisation.  We believe the shade of the big tree is the best option for us.  If the umbrella of ICTU is afforded to us, we can go there and make the claim for the allowances or movements that are needed.  That is our stance.<br\/><br\/>There is no evidence to suggest that a pay review body will work out any better.  In fact, it potentially will work out worse, because there will be an annualised pay so members may not know what their pay is going to be two or three years hence.  If there is an annual report and one is dependent on that report, one has a pay determinant for that year.  In addition, it will disenfranchise members.  If one is giving members pay awards as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>without consultation with them or consideration of their fears, one will disenfranchise them.  We have always voted on every national pay agreement in order to provide members with the opportunity to voice their concerns about pay.  Part of the problem is that it will just be a return to the situation that existed before 1990 and before representation - there is the pay, so take it or leave it.  What will happen is that members will leave.  This is shown in the British armed forces where, in some instances, front-line units were down to 40% strength.  Yes, we have difficulties in Ireland at present with it, but we believe they can be rectified through affiliation to ICTU.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the 1994 contracts, in 2014 we came to the cliff edge of the 21 years for post-1994 personnel.<\/p><p>I was working in the association as a regional liaison officer at that time.  The lack of clarity and security that existed for members demoralised the organisation.  I cannot emphasise this enough.  We need clarity on contracts for post-1994 personnel as soon as possible.<\/p><p> We have made the case that privates and corporals should be allowed to remain in service up until age 50, providing they meet the medical and fitness standards required, and that sergeants should be allowed to remain in service until at least 55, providing they meet those standards.  We impressed upon the Minister yesterday that this has to be done as soon as possible.  If it is left on the long finger, people believe they are being disrespected and start to look for opportunities outside of the Defence Forces well in advance of that cliff edge.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.  The matter needs to be raised frequently until it is resolved this year.  Our members and their families deserve clarity on it.  It impacts on people taking out loans and on the long-term plans they have.  If a member does not have security of tenure and does not know where he or she will be, it is impossible to plan a career in the Defence Forces.<\/p><p> On the question on limited help to members before they leave, we believe those who are going to be veterans deserve support before they go out.  The Committee of Ministers' publication, Human Rights of Members of the Armed Forces, from 2010 states there is an obligation on the State to provide services and vocational training for members of the armed forces prior to their return to civilian life.  It is negligent and reprehensible that people would not be provided with vocational training and supports prior to departure.  At the moment, a pre-retirement course is run for all personnel.  Once they have 21 years done, they are entitled to apply for this course.  It is a good course, run by the barrack personnel support service, which does excellent work.  However, it is not comprehensive enough to ensure people are possessed of the skills necessary to transition to civilian life.<\/p><p> We believe training is needed and there should be a short service gratuity for people who do not reach retirement age, especially post-2004 personnel who go before 21 years of service.  Pre-2004 personnel have a pension but post-2004 personnel may have a pension deferred until they are 60.  It depends on their age.  If they are sergeants, they get a pension at 50.  There should be a short service gratuity for post-2004 personnel who depart the organisation earlier than the mandatory retirement age to assist them to transition to civilian life.  We have a claim at conciliation council for that.<\/p><p> We have alluded to the introduction of a vocational advisor in our submission to the commission on the future of the Defence Forces.  We state that a vocational adviser or trainer should be there.  I was recently talking to the Deutscher BundeswehrVerband, the representative organisation for the German armed forces.  It has a cradle-to-grave vocational officer who assists personnel along their careers.  If they do not reach certain benchmarks in the German armed forces, they are brought in by the vocational officer.  He tells the person it does not look like he or she will make corporal by 50 and so needs training to transition back to civilian life and to be given the necessary skill set.  We believe that would be appropriate in Ireland to help members of the Defence Forces transition to civilian life.<\/p><p>  The tech review on cybersecurity is an operational issue.  The Minister told us yesterday the review was signed off on by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We do not know exactly what has been signed off on.  We welcome that it has been signed off on but we do not know that it will sort out the problems.  There are problems at the higher end in the navy, where the rate is not appropriate:  aircraft mechanics and inspectors; air traffic controllers; cybersecurity personnel.  There is a need to increase the allowances above tech 6.<\/p><p> On the review by the Department, I commend the work of Robert Mooney, Major General Clancy and officials in the Department for getting it over the line.  I thank Kevin Callanan from ICTU for technical support provided to us to get that and Congress to have it signed off on.  There is a need and will still be a need by virtue of the constrained terms of reference that committee had to deal with regarding the tech 2 to tech 6 issue.  It was not allowed to increase the rates or the number of bands that existed.  That was a failing of it.  We have to welcome the work of the Minister and everybody in getting this over the line.  It will help some cohorts of personnel but to what extent remains to be seen.  I hope Deputies Berry, Brady and Clarke follow up on this in the D&aacute;il to make sure it is pushed through.<\/p><p> I will leave the medical assistance scheme with Mr. Quigley, who will speak after I am finished, if that is okay.<\/p><p> Deputy Clarke asked if PDFORRA was experiencing the impact of the housing crisis; we absolutely are.  Something happened last week and we had to write to the Department.  Allowances have been taken off the certificate of earnings for personnel.  Some of the allowances members of the Defence Forces utilise for the purposes of certificate of earnings were removed, which decreases the ability to borrow the maximum amount.  A number of members contacted us on that.  We are actively engaging with the Department to see if permanent pensionable allowances can be included in the calculation of the certificate of earnings.<\/p><p> PDFORRA has sought the introduction of a rent allowance to ensure members have the earning capacity to be able to borrow.  They are priced out of the market at the moment.  The issue of the rent caps being lifted is a problem.  I did not know about the wage subsidy scheme.  I am sure as more members discover it, it will raise its head here.  I thank the Deputy for highlighting that.  I will be able to ensure we are well versed and try to nip that in the bud.<\/p><p> As to whether &euro;29,500 is reflective of the role, it is not.  The hours worked by members are not comparable to the rest of the public sector.  The entry rate of guards, prison officers and so on could be the exact same but the hours are completely different.  Prison officers would have a shift but I am sure Mr. Keane will explain that it is a different thing being locked up on a ship for four weeks compared to working a shift in a prison.  The comparison is not appropriate in all circumstances.  One has to consider the exposure to danger.  The unpredictability of membership of Defence Forces and the hours impact on the ability of partners of members to get employment with the level of security needed for childcare arrangements.<\/p><p>Another employer is not going to help the Army carry out its role.  If a member of the Defence Forces is away on an exercise for three or four days, the children still need to be picked up.  That is the problem.  The onerous nature and unpredictability of service in the Defence Forces means that a salary of &euro;29,000 is not appropriate.  That was what I meant when I mentioned the vagaries of service in my introduction.<\/p><p> What do we need to address that?  We need proper pay and allowances, the application of the working time directive and pensions that match up with retirement ages.  I said that before this committee in 2019.  We are, thankfully, working through some of the issues.  Progress on things such as the working time directive is extremely slow but it is being worked on and we are getting there.  We are not in the place we want to be as regards pay but the likes of the review of technical pay grades should help.  The excellent deal that was done by the public service committee of Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, the Building Momentum agreement, should, provided it is accepted, see the gross pay of members increase by somewhere between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,500 over the course of the next year.  That will happen without the implementation of the review of technical pay arrangements for grades 2 to 6.  More needs to be done.  Fundamental problems such as the application of the working time directive need to be resolved.  We need to provide a rent allowance to ensure that members are able to afford rent because most of our units are in urban areas where rents are through the roof, as the committee knows well and has pointed out previously.  That is what needs to be done.<\/p><p> Is July 2021 time enough?  As I have said, members will start to go fairly soon if clarity is not brought on the issue of post-1994 contracts.  The lack of clarity has a demoralising impact on the organisation that cannot be underestimated.  I saw morale hit the floor in 2014.  We had already been sucker-punched by the reorganisation of the Defence Forces in 2012, which discommoded many families, but the lack of clarity on post-1994 contracts was a blow to the solar plexus and hurt us as an organisation.<\/p><p> I will turn to the shortfall in Estimates and how that excess should be used.  It should be used to pay our members more money and pay them appropriately. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Guinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":586,"content":"<p>What Mr. Guinan would do if he had control of the purse strings could nearly be the subject matter of a full meeting.

I will give some of the background to how we set up and established the scheme.  It was fairly obvious to us, as an organisation, that our job was to help our members in distress.  We discovered a large number of our members were facing discharge and unable to continue in service, sometimes because of fairly small medical problems but because they would be on a waiting list for two or three years, they could not satisfy the strict medical criteria involved, which left their careers at an end.  Even before we set up the medical assistance scheme, PDFORRA established an MRI scan scheme that is supplementary to the medical assistance scheme.  We identified that enlisted members of the Defence Forces had to pay for MRI scans.  We encountered a large number of people who needed money to get scans to satisfy the requirement that they were fit for medical service.  The MRI scheme was the first thing we set up.<\/p> <p>  We did a lot of research into how we could provide a value-for-money scheme that members could afford.  We looked closely at the EU cross-border healthcare directive, as it was at the time, and made contact with the HSE national contract point, Ms Catherine Donohoe.  I must commend Ms Donohoe because she was excellent in the help, guidance and support she offered during the establishment of our scheme.  We then met with representatives of the Army, Naval Service, Air Corps, ANSAC, credit union.  They were our finance partners, if you like.  We established the scheme with hopes and aspirations for what we would be able to do.  To date, members have attended more than 1,200 appointments.  In total, 274 have received treatment, 150 of whom progressed to surgical intervention.  The scheme has far exceeded our projections of what we could or should do.  I still have 60 people on my list who are waiting for treatment.  There is huge demand for the scheme.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Clarke is correct about the type of injuries concerned.  A large percentage are knee injuries caused by elements of military service, including working on boats, aircraft and carrying a pack over heavy ground.  Members of the Defence Forces get injured and that is just a fact of life.  A large number of those injuries would be around the knee but ankles and hips are also affected.  There have been a large number of general surgeries, for example, to treat hernias.  There have been wrist, elbow and shoulder injuries.  Ears, noses, throats and eyes have been injured.  There have been injuries to anything and everything.  We have assisted a number of members to beat cancer through access to treatment, which was very fulfilling.<\/p> <p>  In developing and moving on, we hope to roll out the scheme to include the families of members.  To do that, we would need extra support.  In the first instance, we would need the Department of Health to legislate for the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme.  After Brexit, the EU cross-border directive ceased to apply to the UK so patients can no longer get treatment in the UK under that directive except through the transitional arrangements that are currently in place for anybody who attended before 31 December 2020.  Anybody who attends cannot get treatment in Britain but can get treatment in the North, in Belfast or Derry.

I know some members of the committee raised the issue of numbers in the Naval Service.  One of our members, Deputy Stanton from Cork East, previously raised an issue around the fact that private companies are headhunting personnel from the Naval Service.

That would appear to be a particularly challenging issue.

Deputy Brady and others have also raised specific issues regarding the Naval Service so I give the floor to Mr. Keane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#H01500","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":600,"content":"<p>There is a crisis of sorts, one we have been predicting for the last number of years.  As mentioned by the Chairman, large numbers of highly skilled, motivated and educated people are being headhunted.  They have a skill set which enables them to transit into civilian street, in particular the pharma companies in the lower Cork Harbour area where the naval base is located.  There are a number of multinational companies situated along the quays.<\/p> <p>  I will try to address the issues raised.  The Naval Service will never be family-friendly but we can put measures in place to deal with that.  We can review the patrol patterns, the hours worked and so on.  As mentioned earlier by the general secretary, the time spent at sea for an operational unit is in excess of 60 hours per week.  Deputy Berry raised the issue of State assets not being able to sail.  Our members never prevented any ship from sailing.  That was caused by circumstances out of our control.  Our members have put their shoulder to the wheel and they have maintained operational tempo during very difficult times in the context of Covid-19 and otherwise.  Our people have increased their work output in the sense that they have maintained the frequency of duties and sea days allotted to them by the Department.  That needs to be acknowledged.  They have also taken on additional roles in regard to Covid-19, to which members of the committee alluded earlier.  On the sea service commitment scheme, I agree there is room to manoeuvre.  We lose new entrants very quickly in the Naval Service.  Within the first 18 months to two years, these people are gone.  We have invested time, money and effort in them but we get very little return for it.  That is an issue on which we need to focus.  <\/p> <p>  To address the issues, again, it comes down to the three Rs, that is, recruitment, retention and remuneration.  We need to pay our people a proper rate of pay for the job they do.  It is a haphazard job.  Personnel spend long days and weeks away from their families and they endure a lot of hardship at sea, in particular around the Irish coast when they are required to patrol for up to four weeks at a time with very little downtime.  The frequency of duties when they return to the naval base also needs to be looked at.  As I mentioned in my earlier contribution, accommodation is also an issue.  We need to build homes for these people.  We to get them off ships and into homes.  It is important for their mental well-being that in their downtime and for the purposes of rest and recuperation, R&amp;R, that they have proper, suitable accommodation.  We need to make the Naval Service an attractive career for young, motivated and highly skilled people.  Unfortunately, currently it is a revolving door in terms of the number of people with this skill set coming in but leaving again quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keane.

Ordnance-based workshops in the Curragh are largely populated by civilian employees.  Many veterans are specialists such as armourers and artificers.  They leave the Defence Forces with a pension.  We need their experience and skill set in ordnance-based workshops.  If we could re-employ these people and not abate their pensions, it would definitely help the organisation in terms of front-line maintenance for weapons.<\/p> <p>  On passports, Senator Craughwell is right that we ask these young men and women who are not citizens in this country to travel overseas, wearing the Tricolour on their shoulders.  They do not go to nice places; the places are always rough, such as Mali, Syria and Lebanon.  These people put themselves in danger for this State.  They should be fast-tracked for citizenship and they should not be asked to pay for it.  The Senator has raised this issue previously, including with me about a year ago.  In fairness to him, he has been fully behind us on the issue.  It needs to be done.  <\/p> <p>  On the pandemic and the issue of the Medical Corps, it has done Trojan work over the past year.  Medical Corps personnel have swabbed and vaccinated people and they have worked on the front line with the Dublin ambulance service and ambulance crews across the country.  To provide a front-line service, the Medical Corps needs more training and additional resources.  Deputy Berry is resolved to improve the lot of our medics.  He knows the work they do.  It is extremely difficult and they have performed to the highest standards that could be expected of them.  We would like to see a resumption of normal training with personnel being able to attend courses and being given a little downtime.  An enormous burden was placed on the shoulders of a number of people within the Medical Corps.  I pay tribute to the director of the Medical Corps and the doctors that our Defence Forces have been able to make that contribution.  Deputy Berry will, I know, row in behind in that regard.  It is important that these people be looked after into the future and that they be provided with adequate training.  They are the people on whom others will depend when out on the field and they suffer a traumatic injury.  In that situation, treatment will be provided not by a doctor, but an embedded medic or paramedic and we need to ensure that such people are skilled.  I welcome Deputy Berry's views in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I think I have covered all of the issues raised.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Guinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Guinan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#J00600","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

I thank him for updating the committee on the announcement made in the last 24 hours on the technical pay situation.

Would it be a fair to assert that we would appreciate early clarity and swift implementation of what was announced yesterday?  Would that be a reasonable request?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Keane for updating us on the Naval Service.  We are a very solutions-focused committee.  If the sea-going service commitment scheme was opened up to all members of the Naval Service, which I think it should be, that would assist with retention.  My follow-up question for Mr. Keane concerns the sea-going naval personnel tax credit to the value of &euro;1,500 per year, which is very small in comparison with the seafarer's tax credit, which is four times larger.  We are a solutions-focused group.  If that tax credit was to be increased in the budget in October from &euro;1,500 in an incremental way towards the &euro;6,000 odd value of the seafarer's tax credit, would that assist with retention?<\/p> <p>  Third, I wish to echo Mr. Guinan's comments on the excellent work of the Army Medical Corps, particularly over the last 15 months.  I am aware that many of the paramedics, advanced paramedics and even the emergency medical technicians in the Defence Forces have left as a result of complete exhaustion, burnout and a lack of remuneration.  Does Mr. Guinan have any thoughts on how to stem that haemorrhage of medical staff from the Defence Forces?  I would appreciate his comments.<\/p> <p>  Finally, in respect of adjudications, I direct my remarks to Mr. Guinan.  There have been a number of adjudications recently in respect of the Army Ranger Wing, ARW, for chefs and account holders.  I find it unusual that the PDFORRA goes through the process of conciliation and arbitration, gets to the final step, an adjudicator issues a very reasonable finding, it is not implemented and the association has to resort to taking court action.  That results in massive legal costs, both for the association and the Department of Defence.<\/p> <p>  Those are my four questions.  First, do the witnesses think that in writing to the Minister, a request for early clarity and swift implementation of yesterday's technical pay announcement would make a difference?  I direct my question on tax credits for Naval Service members to Mr. Keane.   I also wish to echo the comments made by Mr. Guinan on the Medical Corps and seek to establish is there is anything that we can do to stop the haemorrhage of highly-qualified medical staff.  Finally, I ask him for his views on the adjudication system.<\/p> <p>  In case there is not time for me to make an additional contribution, I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#K00400","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Keane to respond to Deputy Berry's question on the Naval Service, then I will revert to Mr. Guinan to answer the questions posed by Deputy Berry and Senator O'Reilly and make some concluding remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021052500002#K00500","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I was very welcoming of the tax credit when it was announced by the then Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and PDFORRA.

Obviously, a bit of teasing out will be needed between the Defence Forces and the Department, but it needs to be implemented as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator O'Reilly on the issue of the pay review body, to clarify, we have written to the commission on the future of the Defence Forces.  The proposed pay review body has not been established.   PDFORRA does not believe that a pay review body is appropriate.  We do not want a pay review body.  We are committed to ICTU and the collective bargaining process in respect of our members' pay.  I cannot make that point strongly enough.  We believe that a pay review body will do long-term damage to the organisation.<\/p> <p>  In respect of orders, all orders are lawful unless they are unlawful orders.  I know that is a circular statement.  For example, it is not lawful to order a person to kill somebody if they are not posing a threat.  We work on the premise that all orders are lawful unless they are deemed to be unlawful.<\/p> <p>  On the question of why we believe that ICTU will not punish us, it is because of the solidarity within ICTU.  As an association, if we were punished, we would come out and say that was the case.  However, as things currently stand, we are getting bare deals anyway.  We cannot do any worse.  I am not going to compare the situation to a Monty Python sketch but I am sure that the members will know to which sketch I am alluding.  We cannot be treated any worse than we are currently being treated.  That is the situation.  We believe that we will be better served by affiliation to ICTU.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of ARW adjudications, Deputy Berry is right.  As a former member of the unit, he knows how hard these guys work.<\/p><p>They work extremely long hours in dangerous conditions.  It is regrettable that we had to take their claim to the International Labour Organization earlier in the year.  We have two cases, for the chefs and the account holders allowance, with the courts.  We mentioned this to the Minister yesterday.  He said he is committed to increasing the size of the Army Ranger Wing and I believe him.  He says he wants to work with it.  To increase the size, the Government needs to make that commitment and uphold promises to these people.  A peer review was mooted a number of years ago and it needs to be honoured.  These people need to be paid appropriately and given the proper allowances.  I believe the Minister wants to increase the size and favours them.<\/p><p> I think that is it.  I have tried to be as concise as possible in the answers and I hope I have not left anybody out.  I thank the committee for the work it does and the oversight it provides in holding Government to task on defence issues.  <\/p><p> PDFORRA is extremely proud of the contribution its members have made over that past year.  They have done Trojan work, including contract tracing, swabbing, vaccination, putting up tents with the engineers and working different plans.  The Naval Service has deployed ships to act as swabbing centres.  The Air Corps has worked on the emergency air ambulance service.  All our members have put the shoulder to the wheel with reduced numbers.  We need as a nation to be serious about defence.  These people are the last line and have proven their worth time and again and definitely this year.  <\/p><p> I ask the committee to make every representation it can for these people.  They deserve it.

At the previous meeting, we extended the speaking time for each individual group from ten to 15 minutes to include answers to questions and that worked well.  If the members accept that we do that, I will try and do that on this occasion.  In other words, as we rotate through the parties, the party and our witnesses have 15 minutes whichever way the party and, of course, the witnesses want to manage that, and after that we will rotate it.  As the members will be aware, there is a two-hour limit.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The rotation is as per the clerk to the committee has indicated.  On this occasion, the first group is Fine Gael, followed by Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, the SDLP, the Alliance Party, Independents, Aont&uacute;, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and the Green Party.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will proceed on that basis, except we will provide 15 minutes.  After ten minutes, I will advise the person who is speaking that there is five minutes left in that slot.

If you do not use up all your time, it will mean that you will get back in again when it comes around.<\/p> <p>  Our engagement today is with the representatives of the Ballymurphy families: Mr. John Teggart, son of Daniel Teggart, deceased; Ms Carmel Quinn, sister of Mr. John Laverty, deceased; and P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Muirigh from &Oacute; Muirigh Solicitors.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome them to today's meeting.  I must read a privilege wording that I must say legally to the witnesses.  It applies to every witness.  It is not specific to the witnesses personally.  We say this at every meeting.<\/p> <p>  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person or entity's good name.<\/p> <p>  That is a standard speech I make at every meeting and there is nothing different about today as opposed to other days.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are very welcome.  I appreciate fully the difficult, hard-fought battle they have had for more than 50 years to get into the public domain the absolute certainty that their family members who died on that day were entirely innocent, that many of them were shot in the back and that it is a searing indictment of the crimes that were committed on their family members more than 50 years ago.  It was an indiscriminate use of force.  It was an atrocity.  It is a damning indictment of the past in our island.  I ask the witnesses now to make their opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#A00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here today about the Ballymurphy massacre.<\/p> <p>  On Monday, 9 August 1971, at 4 a.m., internment without trial was introduced by the British Government in the North of Ireland.  The British Army directed the campaign against the predominately Catholic community with the stated aim to \"shock and stun the civilian community\".  Between 9 August and 11 August 1971, more than 600 British soldiers entered the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast, raiding the homes and rounding up local men.  Many were brutalised without good reason as they were dragged from their homes.<\/p> <p>  In the aftermath of internment, 11 innocent civilians, including my father, were brutally murdered in Ballymurphy.  All 11 unarmed civilians were murdered by the British parachute regiment.  One of the victims was the well-known parish priest, Fr. Hugh Mullan, and another was 44-year-old mother of eight, Mrs. Joan Connolly.  All left their place of safety to go to the aid of others.  Almost all were shot in the back.  No police investigations were carried out and no member of the British Army was ever held to account.<\/p> <p>  Evidence suggests that some of the soldiers involved in Ballymurphy went on to Derry some months later and murdered 14 innocent civilians.  Had those who were involved in Ballymurphy been held to account, the events of Bloody Sunday may never have happened.<\/p> <p>  Original inquests were held into each of the deaths in 1972 resulting in open verdicts.<\/p><p>We always maintained that these were sham inquests as not all eyewitnesses were called to give evidence, and the RUC did not carry out any investigations into the 11 deaths.<\/p><p> In 1998, the families began a campaign to have their loved one's names cleared and declared innocent.  As part of that campaign, families started to source eye-witnesses, and to collect evidence and witness statements, which would later be submitted by our solicitor P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Muirigh to the Attorney General, with a request for new inquests.  Subsequently, the Attorney General exercised his powers pursuant to section 14 of the Coroner's Act (Northern Ireland)1959 and, having considered the submissions made to him, he directed in 2011 that new inquests should be held into the deaths of ten of the victims.<\/p><p> The first preliminary hearing took place on 3 March 2014 and the oral hearings began in court 12 at Laganside Courts on 12 November 2018, with an opening statement from counsel for the coroner followed by family pen portraits in respect of our loved ones.  The inquest heard 100 days of evidence, finishing on 3 March 2020.  On each day of the inquests we relived the horror of what happened to our loved ones in August 1971.  It was not easy, in fact it was awful, but what gave us the strength to get through it was the knowledge that every day of evidence was another blow to the Ministry of Defence web of lies created 50 years ago.  We remained determined and united as the truth was finally recognised by the court and the lies of the British Government were laid bare for all the world to see.<\/p><p> Last Tuesday, 11 May 2021, Mrs. Justice Keegan delivered her long-awaited verdict.  It was an historic day for families as they gathered to hear Mrs. Justice Keegan say that all our loved ones were innocent.  They are: Joan Connolly, innocent; Joseph Corr, innocent; Eddie Doherty, innocent; John Laverty, innocent; John McKerr, innocent; Fr Hugh Mullan, innocent; Joseph Murphy, innocent; Noel Phillips, innocent; Frank Quinn, innocent; and my daddy, Danny Teggart, innocent.<\/p><p> We were overjoyed at the verdict.  We corrected history.  We corrected the lies that our loved ones were gunmen and a gunwoman.  We always knew our loved ones were innocent, now the world knows it.  Our joy was interrupted when the British Prime Minister Boris Johnston issued feeble and insincere apologies.  We never asked for an apology, but we did ask for a police investigation.  The police have never investigated the deaths of our loved ones.  We should not need to ask for a proper police investigation: it is normal practice when citizens are murdered.  The British Government now wants to deny us and others any chance for justice by introducing an amnesty for these murderers.<\/p><p> The Ministry of Defence spin doctors, just like they did 50 years ago, are circulating lies, describing these investigations as vexatious or unfair prosecutions.  No one should be above the law.  Amnesties are for people who are afraid of the truth.  If the British Government is so proud of its legal system, why does it not trust it?  Instead it chooses to ignore the internationally recognised agreements and make up its own laws when it suits.<\/p><p> Every victim should have a right to pursue justice.  We will not accept an apology for these murderers and will challenge any attempts to do so.  I ask this committee to use its influence on the British Government to implement the Stormont House Agreement so that other victims do not have to endure many years of campaigning as we did. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank you, Mr. Teggart, for the very clear, concise, and deeply moving statement you have given to us.<\/p> <p>  All of our parties here will comment individually on their concerns and how they hope to bring about the objectives that we all want, which are accountability, justice, and reconciliation.

I wish to thank Mr. Teggart and our guests for giving of their time here this morning.  I thank them for their tireless campaign over the past 20 years, and over the 50 years since they were denied truth and justice for their loved ones.  I was honoured to have read the names of the victims into the Official Report on the night before the findings of the inquest.  We all felt for them that night and on the day when the families finally got vindication for their campaign, and their loved ones were found entirely innocent.  When someone is found entirely innocent then someone is entirely guilty as well.  Everyone should have access to an effective investigation into all of the Troubles-related deaths.  Every family bereaved in the Troubles should have access to effective investigation and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.  I am utterly against any unilateral move that changes the Stormont House Agreement, and what was a collective and comprehensive framework to deal with legacy.  I agree with Mr. Teggart that new lies are being told with regard to the rationale for seeking an amnesty.

That is exactly what has happened.  New lies have been started with these vexatious investigations.  One of the questions asked was about the difficulties then and now.  Things would have been different if we had had a proper investigation.  If the soldiers at one of these massacres had been properly investigated, and if the courts had been more sympathetic to the families without taking the word of the army at the time, I wonder how many people's lives would have been saved at the likes of Bloody Sunday and events all through the conflict of the Troubles.  The committee has to remember it was the army and the likes of its generals who were putting out statements about our loved ones right away, from the first shot, saying they were gunmen and gunwomen.  If things had been done differently in the courts and they had been made accountable, and if the Attorney General of the day had been more forthcoming for anybody who committed a crime, whether it was the army or whatever, things would have been different throughout the conflict.<\/p> <p>  Senator Currie also asked about what the committee can do for us.  Obviously the families have been successful in getting the inquest, in correcting history to show our loved ones were entirely innocent and in vindicating their good names.  We would hope the same help, the same resources and the same laws would be available to others.  Members have to remember the inquests at that time were a sham.  They did not call eyewitnesses.  Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh can expand on this.  The RUC did not interview military witnesses and things like that.  That is where we were at.  We were treated really badly.  One example of how the courts were, although it changed subsequently, was that when my mother went for a civil case at a very early stage she was told by the judge that because my daddy was not working at the time she would have one less mouth to feed and would actually be financially better off.  Those were the kinds of judges, and that was the kind of legal system, that we had at the time.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked how we were treated at the inquest.  From the very start the families had requested a meeting with the legacy department in the Laganside courts for the inquest.  It was very helpful.  It will set a precedent for what others should be entitled to.  They were very family-orientated.  They brought us all into the meeting and we asked for a few things.  We did not get them all but we got basically what was needed for the families, like a family room as somewhere for the families to go.  We brought in the Listening Ear service and things like that.  Even at the end, they familiarised the families with the courts.  All these things were done and I congratulate the coroners service on the way it worked with the families.  I hope it is the precedent for others coming forward.

The point I want to make on the inquests relates to the distress caused to the families.  There was a lot of information that we heard for the first time.  Our legal team were very good at showing us beforehand what would happen on a given day.  The issue was the attitude of some of the soldiers who were called, saying they could not remember.  It was the same thing right down the line and was actually put on a website.<\/p> <p>  The other point is that we were one of the lucky families, along with my neighbours, that actually had an inquest.  There are families who have not had any kind of recognition.  Their loved ones were there one day and then were murdered, and nothing has happened.  Early on in the Troubles, my brother's death was investigated by the royal military police.  That was the deal they had and it was all a cover-up system, as we now know.<\/p> <p>  I want to make the point that the Stormont House Agreement is there and the mechanisms are there, but people cannot move on.  People are stuck in the past because there has never been any accountability for what happened, none at all.  There was a letter sent to the Irish Government with over 3,600 signatures on it of people from all walks who lost someone in the conflict and are looking for some kind of accountability and justice.  That needs to be addressed.  The Stormont House Agreement needs to be implemented and the Prime Minister of England needs to be told quite firmly that there is no amnesty on the table.  That is how I feel.  He came out and gave an apology to the families which I found out about when a reporter rang me to tell me Boris Johnson was apologising to me.  This is the same way he will bring an amnesty in; through the back door.  The Oireachtas needs to push him on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Carmel Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":639,"content":"<p>In reply to Senator Currie's question, any unilateral move to bin the Stormont House Agreement and bring in an amnesty for British soldiers would be a clear breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and also of international human rights standards.  These families will challenge any such move by the British Government in the domestic courts and, if they need to, in the European courts as well.<\/p> <p>  There was also a question on the conduct of the inquest and family participation.  There is no question that this coroner held an Article 2-compliant inquest.  Part of the procedural obligation under Article 2 is to involve the next of kin and we saw that throughout.  That included the pen portraits the families opened the inquest with, which was a new process which had not been used before at an inquest in this jurisdiction.  We had very practical arrangements at the inquest including appropriate seating arrangements for family members and the facility to have sight of civilian and military witnesses as they gave evidence when they were not screened.  It also involved a facility at the courts complex for tea and counselling facilities.  All of that was very important so I must commend the coroners service and the coroner in particular, who put the families front and centre of this inquest.  As Mr. Teggart said earlier, a precedent has been set going forward that families no longer have to feel that they are outside the legal system or that it is a cold house for them.  Mr. Teggart gave a very damning example of how they were treated in 1972.  This has changed and this coroner has set a very good example and high standard as we go forward.  I hope it is replicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Muirigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh.

They are very welcome.  I am sure they are exhausted because they have campaigned for many years to get justice for their loved ones.  They have not stopped since the announcement by Mrs. Justice Keegan a number of weeks ago that their loved ones were innocent.  They need to be commended on all their hard work and determination over the years.  They and other family members who are not here today have carried out their campaign with dignity and respect.  We are all appreciative of that work over the years.  Their composure has been overwhelming in the face of the casual manner of the violence perpetrated by the British powers who murdered the loved ones of our guests on their own streets.  They should be proud.  As a representative of west Belfast, I assure our guests they instil pride the length and breadth of the constituency and beyond.  On the day Mrs. Justice Keegan made her announcement, everybody in west Belfast was saying our guests had done it, they had done what they said they would do.  They have instilled pride in many people across this constituency and beyond, as I have said.<\/p> <p>  The hurt and pain of the massacre could easily have broken our guests' spirits.  The response of successive British Governments that claimed the victims of the massacre were armed and threatening could have left our guests in despair.  In actual fact, the opposite happened.  Our guests suffered loss.  They showed their love for their relatives and their desire to clear the good names of their loves one that were sullied by British liars.  They showed their dedication to the truth and pursuit of justice throughout the campaign.  They achieved the truth, which they rightly deserved.  I believe that for over 50 years the humanity in our guests' hearts lit up the darkness of the loss they grieved.  I welcome that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make one suggestion to the committee.  I suggest that we visit Ballymurphy as soon as possible when restrictions are further reduced to hear in person from the family members.  That is important.  When we are in Ballymurphy, we should also meet with the families of the victims of the Springhill massacre to hear their stories.  Springhill and Ballymurphy adjoin each other and, less than a year after the Ballymurphy massacre, five civilians were killed by the British army.  The Springhill massacre is often known as the forgotten massacre.  It would be good and useful for the committee to agree to meet the families in Ballymurphy and then meet with the Springhill massacre families.<\/p> <p>  My question to the families will touch on something that has been mentioned on many occasions over the years but I think it would be useful for members of the committee to hear this.  It is a difficult time for our guests and all the other families that were affected.  Will our guests tell us what it was like to cope with the loss of their loved ones in such a violent way and then to listen to the British Government and the powers concerned claim that our guests' loved ones were not innocent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Maskey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I will come in now and that will give the families and Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh a clear run at responding to the Chairman and Mr. Maskey.

Such determination is truly inspirational when we recognise the deliberate nature of the obstacles that have been placed before them by the British state throughout the past 50 years.  I also want to take a moment to recognise the work of Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh.  He is one of the few solicitors in this jurisdiction who are legacy practitioners.  They have been deliberately targeted and demonised by the state.  I often hear about history being rewritten and I note Mr. Teggart's opening comments about correcting history.  I pay tribute to the legal diligence that accompanied the families' determination.  Our history books now reflect what actually happened in Ballymurphy in August 1971 and that is something we should all welcome.<\/p> <p>  In the face of the difficulties the families have faced over 50 years, they still managed to get the truth.  My question will focus on the areas of justice and accountability.  The British Government has unilaterally walked away from legacy agreements and now seems set on implementing an amnesty that it announced on the very day that Mrs Justice Keegan declared to the world that the loved ones of our guests were innocent.  The British Government justified the amnesty by saying it wanted to help families to move forward.

It was very hard, I must say.  I was an 11-year-old boy at the time and I grew up angry about what had happened.  There was obviously not much I could have done, as an 11-year-old.  I heard my mummy crying in the night time.  She tried to be strong for the families.  There were 13 of us and we were split up to different sisters and things like that to try to help in some way.  I went to my sister, Alice's.  Others went to live with Bernie, some to live with Margaret.  The family split up as a mechanism of coping and sharing the pain.<\/p> <p>  Things like these affect people differently.  Some were determined to get the truth.  Others experienced mental health issues.  However, we got there through hard work.  As Mr. Finucane said, we have corrected history.  The British Government has walked away from its responsibilities.  We need a strong co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We need more pressure than words.  We have a strong friend in America at the minute from which support can be sourced.  There is a lot of support.  At the same time as the British were going to interfere with the Good Friday Agreement, there were some words about what can be done.  Those are the kinds of things we need to be doing.

In light of the damning findings by Mrs. Justice Keegan, that matter will proceed with vigour.  It is listed for 11 June at the High Court in Belfast and we can update the committee about that in the future.  These families also have a right to an independent investigation, which never occurred, to examine the criminal actions of the British army over the course of three days in Ballymurphy.  Mrs. Justice Keegan highlighted many of those actions by the soldiers in her detailed findings.  The British Government's proposals on an amnesty will be vigorously opposed by the families when they come forward, and this committee could obviously play its part in supporting the families in that regard.  We will be calling, and we hope the committee will continue to call, for the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.

I was eight years old when John was murdered.  On the morning he was murdered, my other brother who was 18 years old was arrested.  My mother and father spent two days looking for them because they did not know where they were at the start.  Christmas 1971 really sticks out in my mind as an eight year old.  Terry was jailed on 18 December for riotous behaviour, a conviction that was quashed in 2015.  There was no Christmas tree in our house.  Our house was always full of activity because I was the baby of 11, but there was nothing.  It was like a silence came over our home.  My mother and father were totally devastated and just trying to cope.  The fact is that there were nightly raids on our home.  That was what the army did.  It targeted the homes of the people who were murdered.  It targeted them to try to keep us quiet.  It tried to demonise the families through the nightly raids.  It was just another way of trying to keep the families down.<\/p> <p>  My mother was never the same person after that.  When I went to school she collected me, we went to the graveyard and we went to mass.  That was my time as an eight year old, so I grew up with this.  It also has an impact on my life.  I am very conscious all the time of where my children are.  They are adults now.  I am very alert all the time and very anxious.  That was the impact it had on my life.  The rest of my older siblings were never the same again.  They did not live the lives they should have lived.  That is why I sometimes get very angry.  Not only did they murder my brother, they destroyed an entire family.  Being the youngest, I watched it.  I watched my mother slowly dying in front of me.  My father died at 61 years of age of a broken heart.  It was just horrendous.  That is why we got justice - that our loved ones were innocent.  We need investigations.  We will never move on.<\/p> <p>  My mother died in 2000.  I was holding her hand when she died.  That is the way she should have died.  I can accept that.

I must agree with Mr. Maskey's comments about the dignity and respect with which the witnesses have carried out their campaign.  It has been something else to watch.

If they can, perhaps they might give a little background about that and what their expectations were in that regard.  Some have the view, even on this island, that achieving truth and justice is not really realistic at this stage and they question the merit of seeking inquiries.  Some are putting them down to the times they occurred, the Troubles and so forth.  How do those comments make the witnesses feel?  What is their opinion of people putting forward those arguments?  Some are also of the view that justice will probably not be recoverable, particularly under Boris Johnson's Administration.  Is truth recovery enough for the witnesses?  They represent an awful lot of people across the Six Counties, and some beyond, who are seeking justice and truth.  Some probably would be content with even just getting the truth.

What Ms Quinn said in her last contribution brought me to tears.  The dignity, respect and love the witnesses show their loved ones, as well as the loss, are clearly there in all their hearts.  They highlighted all the beautiful lives that were lost, but also the domino effect in the hurt, pain and legacy they all have to carry with them.  I am thankful that we have reached this stage with an inquest, but there is so far more to go.  The witnesses have quite rightly said that.  This country has been let down time and again by the British Government.  The disrespect the British Government has for Irish citizens and their lives is sickening to the core.  The value it has put on an Irish citizen's life is clearly not as important as that of a British citizen.  That is the bare fact, in my opinion.  We see the effect of legacy and the effect of not knowing what happened one's loved one.  The witnesses said that over 3,000 people signed the petition seeking answers about all the deaths in Northern Ireland in past years.

I welcome their comments very much.<\/p><p>The contents of Mr. Teggart's initial statement are very striking and clearly show the huge injustice inflicted on so many innocent people.  The taking away of the lives of those innocent people, and also the untold grief inflicted on the families of the victims by being denied the truth for 50 years, must be heartbreaking.  I know the Ballymurphy families have welcomed the inquest findings as a vindication of the innocence of their loved ones, and quite rightly.  They have outlined very clearly the absolute frustration that it took half a century to reach these findings.<\/p><p>In her report, Mrs. Justice Keegan also referenced the isolation to which some victims' families were subjected in their communities during that period.  We all know that losing a loved one - an innocent person - is just horrific.  Not having the truth told for 50 years must indeed be an unbearable burden.<\/p><p>I want to refer in particular to two comments made by Mr. Teggart in his opening statement, which I believe are as powerful as any I have ever heard at this committee.  He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe corrected the lies that our loved ones were gunmen and a gunwoman.  We always knew our loved ones were innocent, now the world knows it. <\/blockquote> <p>Nothing more can be said.  He encapsulated so well everything about the murder of innocent people and the families of victims being denied the truth for half a century.<\/p><p>Of course, the way the British Prime Minister and Government dealt with their so-called apology was totally undignified.  Other speakers quite rightly referred to the very dignified campaign in which the families engaged over the years.  I was privileged to meet the families in 2014 here in Leinster House.  It was clear at the time that they were going to search for and get the truth through a dignified campaign.  It is heartening to see the quality of the campaign led by the families.<\/p><p>I also hear, very loud and clear, the comments of Ms Quinn, Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh and Mr. Teggart regarding no amnesties for people who have committed heinous crimes.  I absolutely agree.  I believe we must never deviate from that position.  The witnesses outlining that point at committee sends a very clear message.  Amnesties are not acceptable.  I will quote Mr. Teggart again, when he said, &quot;We will not accept an amnesty for these murderers and will challenge any attempts to do so.&quot;  I wholeheartedly agree.<\/p><p>Ms Quinn, and in particular, Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh and Mr. Teggart, also referred to the Stormont House Agreement.  That political architecture is in place and it must be implemented.  Again, the witnesses have shown the great quality of their campaign, and the dignity of the families and campaigners, when they talked about other families and victims who also need to get the truth.  People who, unfortunately, have suffered in other atrocities have also been denied the truth for decades.<\/p><p>The witnesses' message about the Stormont House Agreement is a very strong argument from families of victims, alongside ourselves as public representatives in political life, in calling for its implementation.

One has to remember that this is the way the British Government works.  That evening, it took away the first payment that would have been made to family members.  A lot of family members could have used that for sending their kids to university and things like that.  That was the first thing to be implemented from the Eames-Bradley report.  It was taken off the table overnight by the British Government, without any reason at all.  That is how sincere it is about different agreements.  From then on, that has been the way it treats other agreements - with a long finger - and it has done so many times.<\/p> <p>  One must also remember other mechanisms that were put in place, such as the coroner's inquest coronial system.  People who should have known better tried to stop the inquest, and stop people like ourselves, because it was independent and because the evidence did not hold up.<\/p> <p>  The only way the British Government could have been involved in that at all was the lack of resources.  We had the Lord Chief Justice saying we need to clear up the deaths of 95 victims of the conflict and he was confident he would do it in five years.  There was a lack of resources, however.  It took us actually taking the Government and the First Minister to court for the release of the funding for the inquest.  We had to do that also.  They were actually choking the system so it would not work and they are still doing the same.  Many families are waiting on reports from the police ombudsman.  That office is severely underfunded.  That is the kind of thing the likes of this committee can also recommend.  These things are put in place to help victims like ourselves.  People are waiting on inquests because the reports are unfinished years later.  Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh and Ms Quinn could perhaps comment on the rest of that.<\/p> <p>  That, however, shows the sincerity of the British Government when it starts bringing in all these different things like the Eames-Bradley report, the Stormont House Agreement and the new deal.

They dealt with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was set up at the time.  He said, \"I don&rsquo;t believe ... knowing alone makes you happy ... you ... [need] the next thing - you want justice!\"  We are very realistic that justice is difficult 50 years later.  There are the obvious problems and obstacles, such as the lack of investigation at the time, which meant evidential opportunities were lost, and the issue of tracing soldiers when the Ministry of Defence has not assisted the coroner fully with the identification of soldiers.<\/p> <p>  We understand it is difficult.  We are realistic about that.  The investigative arm was central to the Stormont House Agreement for a reason, however.  To do otherwise would, in my opinion, undermine the rule of law and confidence in the justice system, which is very fragile in post-conflict societies.  It is very important that we do not measure this on numbers.  The right to justice and due process is something the families should have.

I remember Mr. Teggart and the rest of the families coming to Derry many years ago and meeting the Bloody Sunday families.  They were walking a lonely road.  The Ballymurphy massacre did not have the same publicity as Bloody Sunday and other incidents.  It did not happen in front of the cameras and happened over three days.  When one reads through the evidence, the butchery that was visited upon those people in Ballymurphy was astonishing.  That evidence was gathered by the families and no one else.  The families had to do this themselves.<\/p> <p>  The British Government murdered these people's loved ones, then blackened their names and denied them truth.  Now it is trying to deny them justice.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  The ten people who were shot and murdered have now loudly been declared entirely innocent.  It is also important to remember Paddy McCarthy, who was a brave man trying to feed children on the streets of Ballymurphy that day and was violently harassed by the paratroopers to such an extent that he ended up having a heart attack and dying.  It is such a tragedy.<\/p> <p>  The bravery and tenacity shown by all of the families over the years are inspirational and something from which we should all take heart.  We must also be clear.  Like others, I am in discussions with the British Government.  It is absolutely determined to have an amnesty for everyone who committed murder during the Troubles.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  I have listened to well-meaning but naive people who always say that we can surely move on.  How can we move on if people are denied truth and justice?  We cannot get to the truth unless there are proper investigative processes.  We have tried asking nicely.  The British Government and paramilitaries are not going to come forward with the truth unless we drag it out of them, and the only way to do that is with a proper investigative process.  That is the only way the Ballymurphy families will get justice and many other families will get truth.<\/p> <p>  Right now, we need an urgent response from everyone in Dublin, America and across the world.  This minute, there is a determination by the British Government to close this down.  That is what it will do quickly.  If this committee can do anything, it is to be loud and determined about ensuring that the British Government does not get away with doing this quietly.  As Ms Quinn stated, the British Government will try to do this and we need to resist it at every single turn.<\/p> <p>  I thank the families for participating today.  It is not easy for them to have to keep going through this.  They should keep telling their story.  A couple of weeks ago, they believed they had a big victory.  They did, but the British Government rained all over that in the way it responded.  It is despicable that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to be dragged to the House of Commons and, when he actually made some sort of apology, it was not for the actions of the paratroopers, but for the way the investigations were handled or whatever he said.  I do not believe anyone expected much more of him, but it was still wrong and we have to keep saying that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colum Eastwood"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Eastwood and all the parties present.

They are very welcome here today.  I join with others in paying tribute to their courage and dignity over the past 50 years in what has been a very long and tortuous road to justice.  I turned 50 this year and feel quite old, which puts into perspective how long a period it is in terms of having to fight for truth and to fully get on record what happened on those days in August 1971, and what happened afterwards.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the witnesses are probably fed up hearing from Boris Johnson with his constant failures to properly apologise.  It probably affects a lot of questions as to how we can continue to highlight and showcase the issues at stake arising from what happened in the Ballymurphy massacre.  In particular, I am very conscious that while the so-called apology last week had the wrong focus there are substantive issues on how the Ministry of Defence dealt with the issue on the days in question, in the immediate aftermath and over the past 50 years, including right through to the inquest.  These aspects are probably not part of the public consciousness, particularly for an audience in Great Britain who see a situation where people were falsely killed.  They were innocent people.  The public do not have an appreciation as to exactly how the situation was so poorly handled by the UK state over that period.  So there is a job of work to be done to highlight and challenge those issues.  The Ministry of Defence, in particular, has been notable in its silence in the intervening days since the inquest itself.<\/p> <p>  Again, I want to stress my party's commitment to the Stormont House Agreement and keeping the prospect of justice very much alive.  Even if the actual real world prospects of prosecutions are slim it is important for all families right across the spectrum that that very much does stay on the table.<\/p> <p>  It is noticeable that whenever the UK Government has responded to the situation that it very quickly pivots to trying to offer an apology for what happened in Ballymurphy and then talks up what it is doing in legacy.  That shows a huge disrespect to the families in that they are linking the families' grief and fight for justice to what it is doing when it is very much at odds with the view of the families as, indeed, of many other people as to how legacy issues should be taken forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":669,"content":"<p>As I took the Independents first last week I will take Aont&uacute; first this week after commentary by the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#H00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank Stephen for his kind words and, as always, he supports the families.<\/p> <p>  It is true that prosecutions should still on the table.  After 50 years people think that there is not much hope.  I think that after 50 years, like our campaign, there is hope because there is new evidence.  There have not been many cases where there has been no investigation at all, as has been said during the day here.  We investigated ourselves.  We went on foot, knocked on doors and found the evidence ourselves.  We brought that forward to Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh to legalise and the statements are with the Attorney General.  So there is hope even after 50 years but it is the kind of thing that the British Government wants to close.  The British Government is disrespectful, as has been said.<\/p> <p>  We must remember who the UK Government is trying to represent and support.  They are actually murderers and they are people who have committed crimes.  Our loved ones were entirely innocent of crimes.  The UK Government is trying to shield the people who committed these crimes from families and the families from them, because these people wore a uniform.<\/p> <p>  Our story has been told here today and we must remember everybody no matter who it is.  All of these families shed the same tears at the funerals of their loved ones.  All of these families have the same hurt and are affected in every way.<\/p> <p>  If one looks at what the parachute regiment alone did, twelve months after Ballymurphy there was Bloody Sunday.  Eleven months later people went to the Shankill and murdered Richard McKinney and Robert Johnston.  This was an elite force who should not have been on the ground in the first place.  Ms Briege Foyle, in her statement on the day, said that parachute regiment should be disbanded.  When soldiers are deployed on the ground in communities in the North then it is a military force, especially a combat force like the parachute regiment.  None of this should have happened and these murderers should not be shielded by any government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We greatly appreciate their attendance.<\/p> <p>  I have followed this campaign for the past two decades.  I am still absolutely dumbfounded that it has taken 50 years for justice to be recognised by the State in the North of Ireland.  There was an incredible injustice done to the victims on those three days.  That injustice was compounded by the defamation of their good names and compounded again by a 50-year wait for the truth.  Many people, when they look back on certain elements of the Troubles, view them as only existing in the past but this campaign shows that that injustice actually exists right up until now, which is an incredible thing.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the full political spectrum here has given such support to the families of the Ballymurphy massacre.  As has been mentioned before, there are many other groups of people in the North of Ireland who have been murdered, their families have been murdered, they have been absolutely wronged and they still seek justice; I am thinking of Kelly's Bar and Springhill.  The victims and their families of the Glenanne Gang where 120 people were murdered by elements and agents of the British state in a small location in the North of Ireland.  The father of an Aont&uacute; councillor, in Dungannon, was murdered in front of her when she was four yeas old.  Recently, she received death threats from the murderer of her father in the name of the East Tyrone brigade of the UVF.  For many people this injustice resonates strongly in their lives today.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest tributes that maybe the southern political establishment can make to the Ballymurphy families would be to make sure that no other campaign walks a lonely journey to justice in future.  We must ensure that all of those who seek justice now have the full energy of the southern State to make sure that they achieve justice for their families.  I would like to hear the voices of the witnesses on that matter.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say that it was the action of a rogue state when the British army murdered citizens in Ballymurphy.<\/p><p>The withholding of justice from families is the action of a rogue state.  The breaking of international agreements, such as the Stormont House Agreement, is the action of a rogue state.  That needs to be called out.  I propose that this committee take legal advice regarding what actions the Irish State can take to ensure that the British Government fulfils its responsibilities to the international agreements it has signed with the Irish State and with the parties in the North of Ireland.  The Irish State should use all the legal levers it has in the context of international law to ensure that the pathway to justice is achievable and not blocked for, or withheld from, any family in the North of Ireland and that agreements are not reneged upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#H00700","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Teggart, Ms Quinn or Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh, whomsoever might like to respond to that point, and after that will be Senator Black.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#J00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I think Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh could enlighten us regarding the legal aspects just mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I endorse the comments made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n concerning the behaviour of the British Government.

This might also be an aspect that the committee could raise, keep an eye on and request a formal response from the Irish Government, and keep in touch with the families.

It is very important that we hear their stories.  The dignified manner in which they have put across their stories and run their campaign has been an inspiration to everyone, right across the board.  Families across Tyrone and mid-Ulster have been inspired by the commitment and dedication of the Ballymurphy families to bringing about justice for their families.  It is important that we view this situation from that perspective.  Mr. Teggart, Ms Quinn and Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh are fighting for their families and to justify the innocence of their family members.  I reiterate that they have inspired people right across the board.<\/p> <p>  It must have been a roller-coaster of an experience for them, in the run-up to the inquest and then also in its aftermath.  Therefore, I thank them all very much for taking the time now to talk to us about the experience.  Their campaign has been undertaken on behalf of everyone looking for justice.  In that regard, we think very much of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The Irish Government has a role to play there to ensure that we do get justice.  One of the things which comes across to me is that it has taken 50 years to get this far.  However, if governments would get behind these campaigns immediately and fight alongside the families involved to try to get justice, that would serve to move things along faster.  <\/p> <p>  As Mr. Teggart said, the British Government has been happy to tell lies for the last 50 years and to spread the narrative that their families' loved ones were guilty.  The families fought very hard to get the inquest findings and in doing that they were pitted against the Ministry of Defence, MOD, the former Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, which did not undertake an investigation, and the British Government, which blocked progress in every way, including by blocking inquests and not providing funding for inquests.  All that sort of stuff has brought us to a situation where the families have now proved that their loved ones are totally innocent.  There are no ifs, ands or buts about it.  As others have said, the British Prime Minister, in particular, and the British Government then refused to be magnanimous and stand up and admit to that innocence the House of Commons, as other British Prime Ministers have done in the past.  <\/p> <p>  The British Government has a record of not implementing agreements.  It has failed to implement every agreement it has ever signed up to.  I refer to the Stormont House Agreement, the agreement concerning legacy issues, and it has never even fully implemented the Good Friday Agreement.  Under the auspices of New Decade, New Approach, the British Government agreed to legislate for legacy issues within 100 days, but it has again reneged on that commitment.  It is now moving to shut down the legal process, which was the only opportunity left to the Ballymurphy families and which was the avenue they had to use.  The criminal justice route, therefore, for the Ballymurphy families and others-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francie Molloy"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I apologise, but we cannot see Mr. Molloy.

She referred to the terms of reference for any investigation.  In short, those terms should be the opposite of what was provided in 1971.  It was a sham process whereby the police responsibility for the investigation of crimes was usurped.  There was an arrangement between the general officer command of the army and the chief constable, which meant that the use of lethal force by soldiers was investigated by the royal military police.  Throughout the Ballymurphy inquest, we saw that the royal military police was involved in the falsification of statements.  That became clearly apparent in the inquest.<\/p> <p>  What we need - and the Stormont House Agreement is a route to delivering it - is an independent investigation which has the appropriate powers to compel documents and witnesses.  That will not happen and there will not be co-operation, for example from the Ministry of Defence, unless the investigation is established on a statutory basis.  A multidisciplinary approach must be taken to the investigation.  It must have access to the forensic techniques that are required for any modern police-type investigation.<\/p> <p>  The key issue is independence.  The families have never had access to an independent investigation.  They have a right to that and deserve it.  We have a framework for the investigation in the Stormont House Agreement, but it has not been implemented.  Therefore, we ask the committee members to continue to call for the British Government to implement fully its responsibilities under the Stormont House Agreement.  We also ask members to oppose proposals to introduce an amnesty for deaths caused by soldiers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Muirigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Teggart or Ms Quinn like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#K00600","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":693,"content":"<p>There is much to cover.  I agree with Mr. &Oacute; Muirigh on his point about the need for an independent investigation.  There are mechanisms that must be implemented.  The Stormont House Agreement and its provisions for setting up an historical inquiries unit must be properly implemented with acceptable leadership.  It would be good for those mechanisms to be put in place for a number of reasons, for people across the board.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned earlier the issue of funding for the mechanisms and the legal system.  Funding for the mechanisms that are currently in place must be backed up.  It must be ensured that funding for the likes of the offices investigating legacy cases is protected and not lost along the way.   <\/p> <p>  I mentioned earlier the issue of funding for those mechanisms and the legal costs.  The mechanisms that are currently in place need to be backed up.  It must be ensured that funding for the likes of th are not protected or lost along the way.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Molloy spoke about the journey of the families being like a rollercoaster ride.  It was an emotional rollercoaster.  We felt that we were hardened campaigners going into the inquest.  We thought we knew it all when we investigated the deaths of our loved ones ourselves.  However, once the inquest went into the detail of how they died, the pain and the injuries they suffered and how they were left to bleed to death in some cases, it was very challenging for the families.  We brought ten pictures of our loved ones into the courtroom.  The idea was to emphasise that they should not be thought of as another statistic, but as people who were murdered in Ballymurphy.  We brought in representations of who they were, what their characters were, who they left behind and how the families were impacted by it all.  It was a rollercoaster.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh mentioned cross-party support.  We can see that we have that support currently.  However, things need to be implemented.  The former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, Deputy McDonald and others have come forward and visited the sites in Ballymurphy.  They have walked in the footsteps of our loved ones.  If others were to visit the sites of the Ballymurphy and Springhill massacres, the families would welcome it and it would lift them greatly.<\/p> <p>  The murders in the Ballymurphy area are linked.  When my father was murdered, an 11-year-old boy was badly injured in the field alongside him.  He was actually an eyewitness to how the victims were treated by the army when the soldiers came into the field.  The boy's father, Paddy Butler, was murdered along with a priest exactly 11 months later on 9 July 1972.  Those murders took place in a small area.  The boy's father was murdered in the spot where John McKerr was murdered, outside the Corpus Christi Church.  Those murders took place in one area alone.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remember all the children, like Martha Campbell, who were murdered by rubber bullets and other weapons.  It was not just the adults who were murdered; our children were also murdered.  They were murdered in their own area.<\/p> <p>  When we were campaigning, I came across archives.  It has helped and will continue to help.  I must say that it was difficult when we turned our attention to the archives held by the southern Government.<\/p><p>I know the Dublin and Monaghan bombing families have encountered the same issue.  As I was saying, that needs to be more accessible.  Rather than requesting archive documents, they should be open to family members who are the experts on how their own ones died or on what information they would be looking for.  That is one of the things we found difficult when we went down to the South.<\/p><p> On the day that Enda Kenny came to Ballymurphy, he also met the Kingsmill families.  He said he would lead by example.  Here is what we need to do.  The Irish Government needs to lead by example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Quinn to make a contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#L00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions about how the families felt.  The night before, I did not sleep at all in anticipation of what would be delivered.  When Mrs. Justice Keegan delivered her findings, I felt overjoyed but also felt very sad.  Here we were 50 years later.  It was a lifetime - my lifetime.  My mummy and daddy were not there.  My eldest sister, Tilly, passed away on Christmas Eve 2014.  She had been through the courts with my daddy because my mummy was not able for the first inquest in 1972, which was a sham, as we all know.<\/p> <p>  The findings made me feel a bit relieved because my mummy had asked me and my other sister to prove to the world that her son was not on trial and was innocent, and we did that.  It was the same day that the Queen was making her speech.  We were waiting.  We had got these findings, we had the truth and we wondered if we would be denied justice.  The next day, when the Secretary of State for the Six Counties gave a so-called apology, it totally deflated the families again.  You are away up there, you are feeling, \"Right, we did this\", and you are deflated again because they have given you the truth but they are taking away justice.  As a family, we still feel we did that for my mummy.  We did that for my brother.

Such legal advice could be useful in relation to other matters in the Good Friday Agreement as well and the wider Brexit conversation.  That is a good idea.  Also, it would be useful as a topic for this committee to look at in general but that is a conversation for the committee.<\/p> <p>  It strikes me that the families here and the families of Ballymurphy are not alone.  The Bloody Sunday families in Derry had to walk a similar journey from the Widgery tribunal to the Saville inquiry.  We have seen obstruction by the British Government at every turn.  We only need look at inquiries such as the Stevens inquiries and the Cory inquiry where hard drives were seized and destroyed in the middle of an inquiry.  Every effort is being made to prevent inquiries or tribunals happening and, when they do happen, to obstruct them even if it is by sabotage, by arson or by theft of hard drives.  The lengths to which the British Government has gone to prevent the truth coming out are quite incredible.  Now, of course, we see the British Government trying to use the system, in terms of the amnesty and such like, to prevent again the truth coming out.  We have the Stormont House Agreement.  We have structures in that agreement that we should be using to help to establish the truth so that no family has to walk that lonely route, as one of the other Deputies said.  No other family has to wait 50 years or should be left waiting another 50 years.<\/p> <p>  One of the points I have been making is that it is not only the British Government we should be focusing on.  I do not want to let the British Government off the hook, but the Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Belfast Agreement.  One of the key parts in the Stormont House Agreement is the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, ICIR.  Something like this requires legislation in London and in Dublin and I do not see the progress coming from Dublin on this.  We need both but in reality we can start pushing ahead.  We can start having the conversation on what we want our legislation to look like and what we want our legislation to do.  The process of pre-legislative scrutiny that we use in this House allows those conversations to happen, allows a broad picture of legislation to be put out there and enables committees and expert witnesses to engage with it.  If we can begin that process, it gives us moral leadership here to say to London that it should get on with it and start doing what it needs to do for the families, for justice and to uphold its end of the agreements it made.  We should be looking at the legal route, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has suggested, but we also need to show our own leadership on this.  Other members and some of the families here have spoken about the need to be proactive and this is an example of how the Irish Government can be proactive in the need to confront.  It is an example of how we can use our action as a form of moral leadership to confront the British Government about its failure of leadership and action.  The Government needs to be shown to be proactive and we as a committee need to be making those demands of the Government and be proactive in making them.  There are other things that the Government can do to be proactive such as ensuring the funding, as has been pointed out.  It is a key part of making sure these things work.  We need to make sure they are funded properly.  These are things we can do.<\/p> <p>  Without trying to excuse the British state or let it off the hook for its failures time and again, we as a committee also need to be asking the Irish Government what is it doing, where its moral leadership on this matter is, where the consultation is on what the ICIR will look like, and where the heads of the Bill are so that we can at least have a conversation even if it is like the question of a border poll on which everyone is saying we need to be better prepared.  We need to be better prepared for the ICIR.  Part of the role of this committee should be thrashing these ideas out, as we do with any other piece of legislation.<\/p> <p>  I do not really have any questions.  Many of the questions I would have asked have already been answered.  I will wrap up now.  Essentially, the point I want to make quite strongly is that the British state has failed so many families who were seeking justice but we cannot let the Irish State off the hook.  As a committee, we need to be proactive in demanding the Irish Government is proactive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021052500002#L00500","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":699,"content":"<p>For clarity, there are some members who have not spoken yet who have come in from the Seanad or elsewhere.

It is a bit awkward when the Seanad is sitting and we have to hop in and out on the Order of Business so I am sorry that I am coming back in late.  I will be totally honest.  To my utter shame, I was not hugely aware of everything that went on in Ballymurphy until the past few months.  I am from a Border area as well so there is no real excuse.  However, I think some of it is a generational thing because it happened 22 years before I was even born.  What the witnesses and their families have done over the past 50 years in continuing to fight for justice for their family members is so important in making people of my generation aware of the huge wrongs that happened 50 years ago.  I cannot imagine what it must have been like to go up against the full force of a state pushing against them to deny them justice and the rights to which they are entitled.  While the situation is not the same, I am reminded of the Ludlow family in County Louth.  One of their family members was murdered and they have said to me on numerous occasions that when their generation passes on another generation of the family will continue their fight for justice.  There are similar tones there.<\/p> <p>  To follow up on a few of the questions asked previously, do the witnesses feel the Government has been supportive in recent years?  Are there areas where we could be more supportive?  In what areas might the Government need to take a stronger stance to properly support the families?  Is there anything we can do as a committee or even as individual members that would be helpful in supporting them more often?

On my behalf and on that of the ICCL and my colleague, Ms Ansbro, I thank the committee for inviting us to present before it today.<\/p> <p>  Over the past 14 months, ICCL has made detailed submissions on all aspects of the Government response to Covid-19, articulating the view that human rights must be protected in dealing with this great social challenge.  The powers created by the Health (Preservation and Protection and Other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 and, indeed, by other Covid-19 legislation are extraordinary.  They permit the Minister for Health to make regulations that impose significant limitations on all aspects of our fundamental rights.  The powers supersede the role of the Oireachtas to scrutinise and debate laws and allow the Minister to designate certain public health matters, which are basic aspects of ordinary life, to be penal provisions, drawing the police and criminal justice system into ordinary daily life.  While many of the regulations have been clear and had an understandable purpose, on some occasions, the failure to carry out a human rights impact assessment and consult with the Oireachtas and other stakeholders, has led to disproportionate interference.  The ICCL is concerned by what is before the House this week and what is proposed by the Minister for Health and the Government.<\/p> <p>  The situation now is vastly different to the situation in March 2020.  At that time, it was unclear if the Oireachtas would be able to sit to consider and pass legislation.  The primary role for making regulations was transferred, on a temporary basis, to the Minister for Justice.  If, however, the Government is asserting that this extraordinary ministerial power needs to continue, and that the Oireachtas should continue to be excluded from scrutinising and considering legislation in this area, at the very least, the Minister should be putting forward evidence of that ongoing necessity and demonstrating that he and his Department have carried out a review of the exercise of these powers over the last 14 months.  This is not about whether the pandemic is over or whether restrictions might still be necessary, it is about whether the Oireachtas will have any role in considering the content of those regulations.<\/p> <p>  Even it is accepted that some ministerial powers need to be retained in this area, we should at the very least be learning from the experience of the last 14 months.  There is no evidence that the Minister or the Department have reflected on the recommendations that have been made by the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, the Trinity College Dublin Covid Observatory, or indeed, ourselves in ICCL, which have consistently made recommendations on how the ministerial powers might be better supervised and the Oireachtas might have a role in consultation and scrutiny over the regulations.<\/p> <p>  Even if the powers are to be retained and extended, we must now consider when temporary measures cease to be temporary.  What is proposed before the Oireachtas this week in terms of a renewal and sunset clause will further marginalise the Oireachtas.  As was pointed out in the Seanad yesterday, this is not about an extension only until November.  This is the possibility of further subsequent extensions beyond that.  We believe there should now be an ultimate sunset clause by which all ministerial powers in this area will cease.  The mechanism that is proposed for further extension will require only a resolution of the Oireachtas to add a further three months beyond November.  At a minimum, there must be a requirement that a technical report be laid before the Houses and that there be a substantive debate.<\/p><p> In light of the fact that the Government has not in any way modified the powers that have been in place since March 2020, we are deeply concerned about an extension to November.  At the very same time as the Government is saying that business and society are returning to normal and international travel is coming back, it is extending these powers until November and potentially indefinitely beyond that.<\/p><p> The ICCL considers the upcoming end date for the emergency legislation on 9 June as a moment requiring extensive review of these extraordinary powers.  Next week, the ICCL will publish a detailed report in conjunction with the Community Foundation for Ireland on all of the pandemic's impacts on human rights thus far.  The Government has had the opportunity to consider the research that has been done and reflect on the experience of the policing of these regulations, yet it is not reflecting any such review in what is before the Oireachtas this week.  We call on the Oireachtas to reassert its role and authority as the primary lawmaker in the State and its role in overseeing executive power.  We would caution it not to allow such an extreme extension of powers without any modification or oversight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":724,"content":"<p>We will return to Ms Coyle now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#B00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Covid has impacted on our personal networks and formal support systems have been wiped out.  The ingrained thinking in Ireland is that mental health is hidden out of sight and it is fringed on the edges of our understanding of what health and well-being are.  This binary thinking is long out of date.  The pandemic has demonstrated how physical and mental health are inextricably linked to one other and to our well-being.<\/p> <p>  In late 2020, RT&Eacute; commissioned important research, entitled The Next Normal, to better understand the effects of the pandemic.  Mental health, which had previously not featured, emerged as the fourth most important issue facing Ireland.  Research demonstrates decreased psychological well-being and increased anxiety, depression and stress as common psychological reactions.   In an Irish context, a March 2021 Am&aacute;rach poll carried out for the Department of Health reported 36% of people reporting stress, 36% reporting frustration, 29% reporting sadness and 24% reporting loneliness.  These were the highest levels since the survey began.<\/p> <p>  Mental health is a dominant theme because it is a sharp reality.  Research shows that different groups have different risk factors for Covid-19.  People with pre-existing mental health difficulties, health care workers, women, young people, people in precarious work, those who are homeless and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be negatively impacted by Covid-19.  When it comes to the effects of the pandemic on mental health, we are not all in this together.<\/p> <p>  Our member organisations, several of whom have appeared before the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Mental Health, have witnessed an increase in those seeking support.  Our mental health system was and is not capable of coping with a surge.  It was struggling and close to breaking point long before the pandemic hit.  When the tide went out on physical health, the inadequacies of our mental health services were brutally exposed.  Deficits include inadequate staffing, ICT shortfalls and insufficient access to services.  Covid-19 underlines the need to reconfigure mental health services.  We must put service users at the centre of design and delivery.<\/p> <p>  The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 has had an impact on those with mental health difficulties who are involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001, as Part 5 of the 2020 Act relates to the 2001 Act.  Mental Health Reform notes that all efforts are and have been made by the Mental Health Commission to ensure the minimum impact on the procedural rights of service users.  However, the legislation in itself continues to be problematic in its removal of safeguards for service users and its infringements of service users' rights, including rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, for example, the right to a tribunal.  In particular, the legislation presents difficulties in some cases for individuals' ability to tell their stories and have their voices heard.  Due to the considerable time these emergency measures have been in place and the progress made on vaccinations, we believe that the measures contained in Part 5 are no longer necessary.  Ireland is in a different place to when this legislation was first enacted.<\/p> <p>  Ireland urgently requires a mental health service that can meet the challenges of the pandemic and its aftermath.  The future of mental health services in Ireland will be shaped by the political action taken now.  We urge the Government to resource, rebuild and reform our services.  In particular, the Government must review and repeal Part 5 of the 2020 Act to strike a better balance between the need to protect people from Covid-19 and the protection of human rights for those under the Act.  We must also address other human rights gaps by urgently reforming Ireland's Mental Health Act and publishing the draft legislation to update that Act in order to support planning for mental health services towards the future, reassure people and restore confidence that mental health services will protect their rights.  We must substantially increase investment in our mental health services and supports to address the challenges of the pandemic and its aftermath and become resilient against future public health crises.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has laid bare the inadequacy of our mental health services and their peripheral position within the health system as a whole.  The pandemic has offered a non-negotiable opportunity to resource, rebuild and resource our mental health services.  We cannot go back to a broken system.  Now more than ever, we need a fit-for-purpose, responsive and adequate mental health system in which people can access the care they need when they need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Our first questioner will be Deputy Durkan.

That is not the way it works under our system.  If anybody can initiate, it is the Executive which has the power to do so.

That is our system and the system in most other European countries.<\/p><p>I am a bit concerned that we might be at cross purposes.

Mr. Herrick said there were unintended consequences in some areas.  Perhaps he can expand on that.  He might spell out what areas he is talking about.<\/p> <p>  I have a secondary question.  I am not saying Mr. Herrick is saying this but I agree with his analysis that there must be proper scrutiny of the effectiveness of the existing legislation; that makes perfect sense.  We must be reviewing all the different elements of that emergency legislation and all the regulations to see what worked, what has not worked and what unintended consequences may have flowed from all of them.  As Mr. Herrick mentioned unintended consequences in some areas, he might be able to help the committee by explaining what those are.

An example of this is the regulations on food in restaurants and public houses which drew the police into monitoring what people had eaten, which was clearly unintended.  Another example is the regulations which regulated house parties which engaged with constitutional problems about the private home.  There were also regulations on public events which did not fully take into account the right to strike and the right to protest, or indeed the right of people to take part in religious observance.  These were all issues that could have been teased out if there had been greater consultation.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view it is of course for the Government to restrict certain rights during a public health crisis but it must do so within the law and must do so with respect to principles of necessity and proportionality.  On some occasions that has not happened.  We saw this again most recently with the mandatory hotel quarantine, where the rushed nature of the regulations meant it was not able to take into account humanitarian circumstances for some of the people who might be subject to it.  Therefore, there are many ways in which the Oireachtas could help to safeguard against disproportionate introduction of powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":749,"content":"<p>I will just make one final 20 second contribution.

It was suggested by many people that individuals were limited to a 5 km radius during that time when in fact, the 5 km only related specifically to the reasonable excuse of exercise.  Whereas these are significant problems about the Government being unclear about what the law is, a lot of credit must go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the common sense and discretion with which it exercised these powers and the leadership it showed in not wishing to overreach powers which were in many respects drawn very broadly.  However, it not satisfactory on an ongoing basis that we would continue to rely on the discretion and judgment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to regulations which are very broadly drafted.  We are now surely at a critical point where most of the restrictions are being lifted and on one hand Government is saying it does not intend to reintroduce them while on the other, it is retaining this extremely broad power for the Minister for Health to legislate without consultation with Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Herrick.

I will ask my questions and the witnesses may respond as they prefer.  Before doing so, I reiterate the point made by Mr. Herrick that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been asked to walk a tightrope in the past year and has done so quite well but this is not a great long-term solution, as it puts much pressure on the force.<\/p> <p>  In the submissions today we have heard much about democratic scrutiny and some of the requests concern comprehensive analysis, technical reports and a substantive debate in the D&aacute;il.  I personally support all of those.  I have a frustration that is not necessarily just around Covid-19 and I could make the same criticism with regard to budgets.  Ultimately, we have a majoritarian Government and there is little we can do to constrain its decision making because of that majority.  The witnesses have suggested the creation of a Covid-19 or human rights committee as a way of directly making recommendations to a given Minister.  Are there examples in other jurisdictions where they do this better and it is a more collaborative decision-making process around Covid-19?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses also said this is not necessarily about the pandemic or the particular health advice in a given moment.  Throughout this year I have been kind of keeping an eye on what various civil liberty groups are saying.  The quality of that advice or interaction has changed.  A letter went out in January on the quarantine matter.  There is a requirement for the groups before us to navigate the health advice but I am interested in seeing if they could expand not necessarily on the quality of the advice but the method or way in which those giving health advice interact with the Government and these groups and how challenging that is.<\/p> <p>  I will be a bit selfish now as some of the emails I get most commonly now are from campaigns that rail against any of the constraints that the pandemic has brought.  I am loath to say the groups contacting me are coming from the far right but it is certainly a position where they think Covid-19 does not really exist or that vaccines are a tyranny and imposition.  How do the witnesses believe we could progress the discussion around civil liberties and return to constitutionally protected civil liberties in the way we are more used to them?  I speak with regard to the discussion being co-opted by groups in an earnest way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#E00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for three very substantive questions.  The first relates to whether there might be other models of decision-making and collaboration.  The ICCL submission to the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, which was reflected in other submissions, looked at some other jurisdictions.  In New Zealand, for example, regulations introduced because of Covid-19 must be approved by a resolution of its Parliament or house of representatives.  That is in clear contrast with what we have here.<\/p> <p>  On the question of a broader system of public health advice, we have also indicated that we support the work of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  It is excellent work from a public health expert body that identifies questions relating to epidemiology.  There is also the question of how restrictions might affect different sections of the population.  We have suggested that the Government could construct another expert committee that might look at the wider economic and social impacts as another source of information to inform its decision.  That has not been taken up.  What we have had instead is it falling to the Cabinet to have that balancing perspective.  The Cabinet clearly operates on the principle of confidentiality and its deliberations are not transparent and in public.<\/p> <p>  Again, in other jurisdictions we have seen broader-based expert bodies informing the Government and the deliberations of those bodies being carried out, sometimes even on national television or in a transparent and public way.  There are ways in which we could make it easier for ourselves as a country by having better decision-making processes that are more open and transparent.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a question about groups that may be critical of regulations but perhaps may have different objectives and it is certainly challenging for us.  This comes into sharp relief on matters such as freedom of expression and the right to protest.  The ICCL has consistently stated that the right to protest is an absolutely fundamental constitutional right.  It would be preferable if the Government could set guidelines on how people can continue to express themselves and have the right to protest but also have some respect for the safety of others.  There may be temporary rules about wearing masks in protests, social distancing or even the numbers involved with protests.  It would be preferable to allow people to express their views in a safe way, even if we may not agree with them, instead of effectively having a blanket ban on protests.  That would again create a risk that the Garda would have to distinguish between different protesting groups, which is not desirable.<\/p> <p>  We should of course respect everybody's freedom of opinion and belief but there must be some respect for the rights to health and life of others as well.  We can do that and it would be preferable to allow people to protest safely than to prohibit protests completely, which has been the case, unfortunately, in some periods over the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I will make a brief comment on the mental health side.  The specific area of the emergency legislation we are concerned about is Part 5.  It is a good example.  It was introduced at an unprecedented time and legislation was needed to ensure that physical tribunals could take place remotely.  We are in a very different place now and we have learned much.  Much of what is contained in that Part 5 was not acted upon.  For example, we know that since March last year all the mental health tribunals have been seen by three persons, although the Act has a provision to use one-person tribunals.<\/p> <p>  Much of what is in there is no longer relevant because we have shown over the past year and a bit that we can adapt and put better procedures in place that could be more responsive to people's rights.  We really need a debate on that and a discussion of when this amending legislation no longer needs to be in place or necessary.  Part 5 of that legislation is a good example of where a discussion could be had.  It is not ideal that people's rights are not being adequately protected under the legislation but we know what is happening in reality.  There may not be a need for those provisions to be in place any longer.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's final question, there is much discussion and discourse around mental health and the impact of the pandemic and restrictions on such health.

The question is whether the extraordinary powers the Government has should continue.  The Bill currently going through the Oireachtas is a matter of concern.

What is now being proposed will further marginalise the role of the Oireachtas and further centralise the power of the Minister.  In the first instance, the Minister will not be required to come back before the Oireachtas until November, an extended period during which, we understand, the vast majority of the population will have been vaccinated, international travel will have restarted and so on.  Thereafter, it will, as Deputy Hourigan noted, only require a simple resolution to continue to extend the law beyond that point.  There will not be a debate.  There will just be votes in  both Houses of the Oireachtas, which is a weaker protection that exists at this point.  We see this as a further marginalisation of the role of the Oireachtas.  It calls into question whether what was clearly envisaged as a temporary measure for a certain period of time is now being extended beyond that.

In terms of what regulations we would have said were not necessary over the past 14 months, one of the key points we have tried to make over the period is that we need a human rights impact assessment to properly assess what regulations were necessary and those that may not have been and which did and did not constitute a proportionate interference with our rights.  That is still outstanding.  We have not seen a proper human rights impact assessment and it is something we think is necessary before we can properly assess whether we should have those regulations in place and whether we need to continue to renew the legislation that allows further regulation to be made in the future.<\/p> <p>  We have carried out some assessment of a number of rights and interference with rights over the past 14 or 15 months.  Some of the elements that we had issues with from a rights perspective where the fact that when regulations were put in place, there were blanket bans on rights.  At certain levels, there was a blanket ban on, for example, events and certain gatherings.  Looking at other jurisdictions, we saw the constitutional court in Germany say that a blanket ban on protests was disproportionate and constituted a disproportionate interference.<\/p><p>When our regulations gave rise to the blanket ban on gatherings, we would have said that was disproportionate.  We have constantly called for an exemption for the exercise of fundamental rights, including the right to protest, to be constitutionally reasonable if it seems to be done in a small safe manner.  We were not saying that normal protests should have been allowed.  Small, safe protests should have been allowed, however, given the fundamental importance of those to our democracy, particularly at a time when so many decisions impacting on lives and livelihoods were being made.<\/p><p> We also thought that there could have been a more targeted approach to restrictions on movement.  The primary legislation gave the Minister the opportunity to designate affected areas.  One of the fundamental principles here is that any decision to impact rights must correspond to good data and evidence of risk.  We think that could have been done in a more targeted manner using the affected areas possibility.<\/p><p> We also thought that there were times when the regulations relating to criminal sanctions might have constituted a disproportionate penalty for the exercise of rights.  We saw a significant expansion of powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of inspections, closure orders for various establishments and fines for the exercise of fundamental rights.  Not only did we see the introduction of fines, we then saw legislation increasing the possibility of those fines.  We do not think there should ever be criminal sanctions for the exercise of rights and that enforcement of public health guidelines should be done through proper communication and targeted supports.  In respect of having regulations that are not clear, which has been identified as an issue not just by us but by the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, the Policing Authority and IHREC, there were times when regulations were made in a way that was not clearly communicated.  There were very subtle changes.  There was no clarity among the population about what was law and what were guidelines.  We then had the enforcement of issues that were not clearly communicated to the population using criminal sanctions.  This has been identified as a major issue by us and IHREC.  In terms of the changes, not only was there a need for better communication, there was a need for better consultation with human rights experts both as the regulations were being drafted and in assessing the impact of the regulations on us.  There should have been better consultation in advance with Oireachtas committees and human rights experts like IHREC and better oversight and approval by the Oireachtas.  IHREC recommended that ten days following the publication of each regulation, it should be approved by the Oireachtas, a call we support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Doireann Ansbro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":770,"content":"<p>Could I get a response on the issue of mental health because it is important?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#G00200","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":771,"content":"<p>The Deputy has run out of time but I will let Ms Coyle come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#G00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I will respond very quickly and we can follow up in writing afterwards.

For example, there was very positive engagement by the Department of Health with civil society experts concerning the Covid tracking app and as a result, good privacy protections were built into it.  This is an example of what is possible if the Department takes a wider view.  As I said earlier, I agree with the Senator that if the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response had remained in place, it would certainly have improved the situation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the constitutionality of what is being done, this is not a question about the proportionality of specific regulations.  Certainly, there are some regulations that it is arguable were disproportionate and Ms Ansbro has identified some of them.  A number of other ones have come before the courts, which have had to consider their constitutionality.  The deeper question is whether the Government is acting within the rule of law when the Minister has been delegated such a broad power to introduce legislation which , in some instances, takes on the character of primary rather than secondary legislation, particularly when those regulations have a criminal effect - a penal provision dimension to them - and where we seen instances where the law has not even been laid properly before the public when it has come into effect.  That is the area in which the Government has shown some poor practice.  Whether that falls beyond the threshold of what is constitutional in terms of compatibility with the rule of law is a matter for the courts.

That is clearly not the case one year later, which is very worrying.  It is a very dangerous precedent to accept that this legislation can be renewed every six months without democratic debate.  Yesterday, I was also very unhappy that we only had an hour in which to discuss this issue.<\/p> <p>  The protection of the human rights and mental health of Irish citizens is a priority for us.  I do not feel that the extension of the timeline without debate is acceptable by any means.  In fact, this week I co-signed an amendment, tabled by my colleague, Senator Higgins, in respect of the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill which calls on the Minister to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a detailed and specific report on the operation and impact of each of the four emergency Acts by 9 September 2021.  I am concerned that, thus far, the Department has not conducted a review of the emergency health legislation in light of its far-reaching powers.  It is also far from best practice to agree to this Bill without information on how the effect of granting these extraordinary powers have had to date on the fundamental rights as well as the mental health of the Irish population.<\/p> <p>  As already stated, Senator Hoey asked the questions I intended to pose.  I ask the witnesses to forgive me if they have already responded because I missed some of the discussion earlier.

On a positive note, we have seen a real recognition that mental health is at the core of everything.  It is brilliant that this committee has invited us here but we would like all of the Oireachtas committees to invite us because we feel that mental health is a cross-cutting issue, and one that needs to be addressed by many Departments and committees.

A few months ago, the quality improvement unit of the HSE said something quite spectacularly interesting.  It said that we cannot go back to the broken system.  That is something with which we agree.  Covid has given us an opportunity to totally reconfigure the health system.  We would go further and say that Covid has given us a non-negotiable opportunity to totally transform the mental health services so that they can become fit for purpose.

There is a specific human rights obligation on the Government to ensure that any general policy does not result in indirect discrimination in respect of particular groups.  We are concerned that that assessment was not done at the outset and still has not been done properly.  What we have seen is that there has been a disproportionate impact on a number of different groups in society, including women who are in low-paid jobs, who lost their jobs or who have been affected by the care burden and the lack of proper childcare supports.  So there are particular people who have been impacted upon in a variety of ways.  We also saw a disproportionate impact on people living in congregated settings, namely, those living in direct provision centres and people living on halting sites.<\/p> <p>  We have seen a number of minority communities potentially impacted in a greater way by the policing approach.

It is excellent.  It is all very new but it is important.  The big message that Mental Health Reform wants to get across to the committee is that specific groups are definitely more vulnerable to the impact and the results of the pandemic.  Specific and targeted interventions are needed.  In our current situation, with how the mental health system is so poorly fit for purpose, there is no way around this.  We need a lot of funding and we need to ensure the funding goes into the front-line services to offer targeted, preventative interventions.<\/p> <p>  We have touched on the groups that are extremely vulnerable, and there are quite a lot of them.  It will be very clear to Deputy Ward that many of these are people who have poor access to the social determinants of mental and physical health - to use the jargon.  In ordinary language, this means people who cannot access proper housing, education, jobs, communication, and amenities.  Their children cannot play anywhere.  The list is endless but I do not have the time to go into it in detail.  These people, and especially those in precarious employment situations, are very exposed to the virus.<\/p> <p>  An interesting group is healthcare front-line workers, and nurses and midwives in particular.  The CSO has done an interesting piece of work that matched up census 2016 data on occupations with the total number 69,000 cases of Covid in the March to November period of last year.  The CSO found that despite being only 2% of the full total of the workforce, nurses and midwives made up 6% of all cases of Covid.<\/p> <p>  There are also people with pre-existing mental health difficulties.  They suffer for two reasons.  First, there is the pandemic and the restrictions, which have impacted very obviously on that group and disimproved their mental health status.  As a cohort, they are also more likely to get infected with Covid-19.  This is a double whammy, if one wants to put it like that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Ansbro has already referred to women as a vulnerable group, and particularly women in part-time, precarious employment.  They have been impacted very badly by Covid.  A survey by the National Women's Council tells us that many women have been impacted hugely by caring responsibilities, which have increased since the pandemic, with 55% having less time to concentrate on their own mental health.<\/p> <p>  We could not ignore the cohort of youth aged 18 to 35.  This group has been hugely impacted by the pandemic for a variety of reasons.  As other speakers indicated, specific and particularly marginalised and vulnerable groups include people with a dual diagnosis of addiction, those who are homeless and ethic minorities who live in precarious housing situations.  The list is not endless but these are quite specific groups who will need quite specific and targeted interventions.  We will need funding to get to grips with this.<\/p> <p>  As the HSE report published in February indicated, Mental Health Reform believes that our sector can be a partner in the future to reconfigure how mental health services are designed and delivered.  We stand ready, on behalf of our 75 members, to work with the HSE to create targeted interventions that will allow people to access mental health services when they need them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Audry Deane"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I have one supplementary question.

It is doing massively valuable work.  When it did its first review back in March 2020, which seems like a long time ago now, it found that there was already quite a high level of mental health difficulties in the general population, regardless of the impact that was to come in the intervening period.  One can see that there are people out there who have not yet reached out and who are existing with some degree of mental health difficulty.  There can be no doubt that if their mental health deteriorates and if the services continue as residually as they do in many cases, we will run into a serious problem.<\/p> <p>  There are, however, a lot of people out there who have been exceptionally resilient and who have not suffered.  After the initial blip - the uncertainty, the fear, the huge anxiety and the stress - many people are actually coping very well.  We in Mental Health Reform are not in the doom and gloom business.  We value and celebrate people who survive, thrive and flourish in resilience.  We want to make sure that everybody can do that.  We will need appropriately funded mental health services, but 5.1% of the total health budget is not showing us that mental health has parity of esteem in the current status, as Deputy Ward will be aware.

We would clearly have liked more time to discuss these matters but the legislation was sprung on us without pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee.  That is not best practice.  The legislation gives extraordinary powers to the Minister and there is a concern over democratic oversight of legislation that is going through the D&aacute;il.  We realise that this legislation has transformed people's lives.  It has taken away many of their basic rights.  I do not know if members of the committee would like to respond to this, but one of the issues people raise is about the importance of bringing people along with us.  Unfortunately, throughout this process, we have not been good at doing that.  We have not been good at bringing people along with us in respect of the legislation.  Some of the regulations have been of an arbitrary nature.  Strikers have been stopped and their names have been taken during the pandemic.  People have, in many ways, not been able to protest.  People have been forced to give up many powers.  They have been unable to bury their dead properly.  They have been unable to attend religious ceremonies.  Those were all significant decisions that were made, supposedly in the public interest to protect against the pandemic.  They have had huge impacts.<\/p> <p>  I noted that the representatives of Mental Health Reform talked about a survey was carried out by the Department of Health.  Some 36% of respondents reported stress and frustration.  Some 29% reported sadness while 24% reported loneliness.  Those are the highest levels since the surveys began.  The Samaritans have been getting an unprecedented number of phone calls.  The Garda has reported unprecedented levels of domestic violence.  There are difficulties in getting space in a safe refuge for many people who are crying out for help.  We know the pandemic has negatively impacted people.  I do not know if committee members have a view on this.  The committee shares the concerns of our guests about the fact that there has been no real review of these powers.  We asked representatives from the Department of Health whether there was going to be a review.  If there has been a review, this committee has not had access to its results and that makes it difficult for us to move on.<\/p> <p>  This meeting has been an attempt to give an overview of the legislation.  It is not ideal.  We need more time to discuss it and I share the concerns of members in that regard.  If we are to give extraordinary powers to a Minister, we need to scrutinise the legislation and the amount of time that has been allocated is clearly insufficient.  The legislation has not come to the D&aacute;il yet but I hear the frustration of our colleagues in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  The survey indicates a crisis in mental health.  Do we know if healthcare workers in mental health areas were withdrawn to be used in other work, such as Covid testing and vaccine roll-out, etc.?  Perhaps our guests from Mental Health Reform could respond to that.  How did the pandemic impact on services?  We heard from parents whose children have special needs that classes had stopped and that lack of routine caused difficulties.  Have our guests been picking up how that impacted children?<\/p> <p>  Many parents have talked about the lack of supports, particularly during the pandemic.  Some people have had difficulty in getting through to their GPs.  There have been difficulties for people going to accident and emergency departments because the recommendations were not to go unless the situation was an emergency.  Is it still the case that many people must take the accident and emergency route in order to access mental health services?  Do many parents still have to make an ultimate decision about abandoning a child so that services will follow?  That has been said by a number of people.<\/p> <p>  We were told at the start that this legislation would contain a sunset clause.  We are not really in a position to discuss the legislation but would Mr. Herrick have concerns about the continuing and random nature of these powers?

We do not have a functioning mental health information system.  In fact, some of the files are, in some cases, handwritten on paper.  There are considerable challenges in that regard.  We cannot currently track patient outcomes and pathways across the various settings, whether community, secondary, specialist or in-patient acute.<\/p> <p>  I am mindful that on 21 April, the D&aacute;il debated mental health.  Some statistics were discussed which, at that stage, were fresh.  Some 8,892 children are currently waiting to get access to psychological services in the HSE.  With regard to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, we have known for quite some years that the capacity to reach out to children and adolescents when they need care is not there.  The issue was debated at length in the D&aacute;il recently.  Is it acceptable and appropriate to have a target that a patient would be seen by a CAMHS team within 12 weeks?  Is that how services should be benchmarked?  Our view is that for a child or adolescent to spend 12 weeks waiting for a service when they are in distress is not good practice.  There are currently 2,730 young people waiting to get access to CAMHS, of whom 98% have been waiting for over a year.  None of us here has to work very hard to imagine what that means for a young person, his or her family, carers and immediate community.  We do not even have any data on who is waiting to get access to adult community health teams.  <\/p> <p>  I could rattle on with other statistics but it is enough to say that services are inadequate at the moment.<\/p><p>People cannot access services.  We are concerned about future outcomes.  It is quite clearly the case the HSE&rsquo;s expert group on Covid, drawn from mental health specialisms within the HSE, has delineated the pathway.  The fourth wave will involve the individuals in question.  Deputy Ward has already alluded to some of them.  I refer to people who are currently undergoing mental health difficulties for the first time.  In the coming months and years, that group plus all the other specific vulnerable groups, whose situations we have described, will all be trying to access services to meet their needs.

I understand that while this meeting has been under way, the Minister has indicated in the Seanad that he intends to bring forward an amendment to the effect that the provision for three-month extensions would be for only one-three month extension rather than an indefinite number.  That is a positive step but it does not go far enough.  It is essential that the Oireachtas should be given a role in overseeing the introduction of any regulations.  Many practical suggestions have been made on how this could be done, for example, a period of time would be allowed and regulations would lapse if they were not approved by the Oireachtas.  We hope that might be taken on board by the D&aacute;il in the coming days.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman raised an important point to the effect that we need to bring the people with us.  From our perspective in terms of civil liberties and human rights, what we have seen during the past 14 months is an incredible demonstration of solidarity by the Irish people, with the population sacrificing their rights and civil liberties for the protection of the most vulnerable in our communities.  That is incredibly impressive and we should recognise and celebrate it.  However, it behoves the Government to reciprocate and prioritise the restoration of people&rsquo;s rights.  The concern is that more priority seems to be attached to the reopening of the economy than of a return to normal civil liberties and democratic rights.  If we were to reintroduce democratic controls, we would get better outcomes in terms of better rules laws but we would also defuse matters with regard to much of the negative disinformation.  We would be showing people that we are taking their rights seriously.  That would take much of the heat out of arguments of those who might be advancing conspiracy theories or other suggestions that the Government is engaged in something nefarious.  In fairness to the Oireachtas and the Government, their first priority is the protection of health and we should all be coming behind that.  There is an opportunity this week and next week for the Oireachtas to show that it is taking rights  seriously, reintroducing democratic protections and taking away extraordinary temporary powers from the Minister for Health because this is the right time to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":798,"content":"<p>Could I add a further point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Doireann Ansbro"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":799,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021052500002#L00600","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":800,"content":"<p>We need to remember that what we do today sets a precedent for the future.

That is why conforming to rule of law standards and human rights law, which is in place to protect us, is important.  One way the Minister can demonstrate his commitment to the rule of the law, human rights and democratic scrutiny is by taking an opportunity to revise the initial legislation before it is renewed.  He can do that by introducing these democratic oversight requirements in the primary legislation.  For example, by requiring pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas of all regulations and that the Oireachtas must approve regulations within ten days of they being passed, as IHREC recommended.

What they had to say demonstrates a great deal of common purpose. There is a strong commitment on their part to the protection of human rights.  We all want to achieve the same thing.  Many of the difficulties we have had during the past year have been due to the pressure of time in dealing with an emergency, but we have an opportunity now to move beyond that.  We will have further challenges in the coming months.  We want to achieve the strongest possible public support for the vaccination programme in particular.  Ireland could be heading towards having as high an acceptance rate of the vaccination programme as 90%, one of the highest in the world, which shows the people are behind the public health effort.  On the other side of the ledger, we should be returning to normal democratic rights, removing emergency temporary ministerial processes and particularly emergency laws that take away the rights of the most vulnerable people in our community such as those suffering with mental ill health.  We should be reintroducing parliamentary democracy to the fullest possible extent.  There is common purpose here.  The Oireachtas has spoken very loudly about this both in terms of the Seanad debate yesterday and this debate today.  I hope that the D&aacute;il will do so in the coming days.  We very much hope the Minister for Health shows a willingness and openness to have stronger safeguard protections, which, as the Chairman said, would bring the people along with us.

When the agency was first mooted in the national planning framework, it was quite clear that the purpose of the agency was to be primarily in the area of active land management, something for which the NESC, the ESRI, the Housing Agency and others have called for a very long time.  Under the previous Government, however, the LDA became far less an active land management agency and more a residential developer.  As a consequence, it has very weak compulsory purchase order powers.  It will not be able to work on land other than in active partnership with the landowner, whoever that may be.  Therefore, the original intention and something that is desperately needed, an active land management agency with strong CPO powers and a strong budget for land acquisition, public and private, is missing from the Bill.  This is the first in a series of amendments we are tabling to try to shift the focus away from residential development, which we do not believe the LDA should be involved in.  We think that should be the function of local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.  Instead, we want to insert in the centre of this legislation active land management policies, as other jurisdictions have, which play a very important role in bringing down the price of land, moderating development costs in the public and private sectors and making homes more affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#A01000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I will try to start in a positive vein because we have a lot of work to do to get the Bill through.  It is significant that this groundbreaking legislation is now on Committee Stage.  I look forward to working with colleagues of all parties and none to get the legislation through as expeditiously as possible.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has just raised a point about the provision of a budget for the Land Development Agency to capitalise the agency.  This can only be done once this legislation passes.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to change the name of the LDA, which was established under a statutory instrument in 2018.  This is an amendment about what the agency is called versus what it does.  What we are focused on is what it actually does, which is precisely to develop and manage State lands productively, to deliver affordable, social and cost-rental homes for our people, to get on with using the land banks we have and to work in partnership with our local authorities where necessary.  I still see local authorities as the main driver of social housing.  This amendment relates to what we should call this agency.  The LDA was established in September 2018 and, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin will know, has been progressing works since then on the number of sites over which it has a remit.  One in particular will break ground this year, and that in itself is significant.  The LDA is working in partnership with multiple stakeholders, local authorities and other State bodies.  Multiple public consultations have already been run since the agency's establishment.  We want to establish the LDA as a commercial State body under primary legislation.  The Bill deals with the LDA's corporate form and funding models among other provisions such as CPOs, which the Deputy mentioned and which were not provided for in the original Bill, and many very significant elements that will help drive forward development and land management, which the LDA has been actively involved in already through the register of public lands.  It makes sense that the Bill should be named after the agency it seeks to establish so, fundamentally, I genuinely do not see any merit in accepting this amendment and will oppose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#A01100","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":820,"content":"<p>As I said, this is the first in a series of amendments that seek to shift the focus of the Bill onto active land management.  I will move on to my second amendment in this grouping, amendment No. 13.  The Minister will be able to see very clearly what we are trying to do here in respect of active land management.  The function of the agency should be to assemble land and, as amendment No. 13 makes clear, to make that land available to local authorities, approved housing bodies, community housing trusts and other not-for-profit bodies.  Key is that this is not simply a symbolic issue of the name of the agency; it is what we want this agency to do.  I do not believe a commercial entity operating through designated activity companies is the best way to use public land.  I do not believe allowing any of that land to be used for the development of unaffordable, open market-priced homes that could cost anything between &euro;350,000 and &euro;500,000, depending on the location, is good.  It does not matter if it is 10%, 20% or 60%.  Therefore, this is a fundamental issue of what we want this agency to do.  It is not just about the title; it is about the functions and the output of that.  The LDA does not have the capacity, staff or planning expertise for residential delivery.  We have great local authorities, AHBs and other entities that already have all that.  What they do not have is a willingness on the part of central government to fund them to deliver large-scale developments of mixed-income and mixed-tenure housing for social and affordable rent and affordable purchase.  That is why this series of amendments - and we will come back to this at later stages - is about essentially trying to redirect this Bill into what its function should be, that is, active land management to assist public housing bodies to deliver public housing rather than essentially a publicly owned private company that will use private development methods and finance, which will push up development costs and even make the affordable homes less affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#A01200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":821,"content":"<p>This goes to the heart of what the differences are between the Government and the main Opposition party.  Our public deserve better and they want to see the lands we have developed and put to productive use for homes, affordable, social and cost-rental, for our people.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 13, and the other two related amendments tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, would fundamentally change what this agency is meant to do.  The Deputy said that clearly and that is fair.  It would, however, put this process back significantly and add further delays with regard to the delivery of public homes on public land, which is something I, as Minister, and most Deputies, could not really stand over.<\/p><p> Let us just understand what the agency will do.  This will deliver homes in addition to what our local authorities and approved housing bodies will do.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned supporting and resourcing those agencies.  I will remind the Deputy that in this year's budget, we have the largest single housing budget in the history of the State to deliver 9,500 new builds and social homes through our local authorities and approved housing bodies.  We need to build up their capacity too.  Let us not fool ourselves that the capacity to deliver homes is there in every local authority.  It is not; we must work to build up those resources.  Second to that, however, is actually looking at the other land banks that the State and other State agencies have.  A good example are the sites the LDA has already.<\/p><p> Take the Shanganagh Castle development, which the Deputy's party delayed a number of times.  We hope to break ground on that this year.  That will be done in partnership between the local authority and the LDA.  In many instances, however, the LDA will be developing and delivering lands that are not local authority lands.  They will predominantly be State agency lands.<\/p><p> This amendment actually seeks to delete all references to development and regeneration by the agency, which I find pretty remarkable.  The agency should be able to develop and regenerate relevant public land.  What Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking to do, however, is replace this with a provision to make such land available to local authorities, approved housing bodies, community housing trusts and other not-for-profit bodies.  I am tasking our local authorities to deliver and develop on their own lands.<\/p><p> I was in the Deputy's constituency in Clondalkin last week, where 12,000 homes are going to be delivered, both affordable cost rental and private homes, between the local authority and approved housing bodies.  That is a good thing.  The Deputy is saying now with this amendment that the LDA would effectively manage the land bank and hand it over.  I see it actually putting real homes on the ground for people in a short space of time.  Passing this amendment would, therefore, fundamentally change what we are trying to do here.  It would change the direction of the agency completely and delay the provision of homes for an inordinate length of time.  I would like to think that is not the reason for this amendment.<\/p><p> I will move on to the other two amendments within the grouping.  Amendment No. 33 seeks to amend section 2, which would provide that relevant public land would be used by local authorities, approved housing bodies, community housing trusts and others.  Amendment No. 77 would do the same thing.<\/p><p> All those amendments will actually remove the building aspect that we want the LDA to do in partnership with smaller builders and local authorities to deliver homes for people.  These are fundamental to how we go forward.  If people look at them with any degree of detail, they will see that passing these amendments, which have been tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, will actually stymie the agency and delay the delivery of homes in the middle of a housing crisis.  That is not something I or this Government will stand over.  I am, therefore, opposing these amendments.<\/p><p> To be frank, it should really be clear to people that the development and regeneration of relevant public lands is one of the most important purposes of this Bill.  The LDA has been tasked with enabling such developments.  To remove a reference like that from the Bill serves absolutely no purpose other than trying to fundamentally change what the agency is about.  It is basically going back to square one and losing all the time that has been worked on in establishing this agency.<\/p><p> I will go back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's very first point about giving the agency a budget and capitalising it.  If this were to happen, it would not really be developing anything.  What, therefore, would it need?  Would it just be an administrative body?  I do not believe that is really what people want.  It is certainly not what I want.<\/p><p> Furthermore, one of the primary purposes of the legislation is that where relevant public land is underutilised, the LDA will be able to acquire it for the purposes of development for housing.  I cannot see why anyone would disagree with that.  The LDA will not be replacing the role of local authorities in any way, shape or form.  Indeed, under section 14 of the Bill, the LDA will work with and assist them in the development of larger-scale sites.<\/p><p> I will repeat again, however, that local authorities will be the prime deliverer of social homes and direct build affordable homes on their own land.  Of course, it has to be and is open to the LDA to also work with other housing bodies as they develop sites.  It is not appropriate, however, that the housing development functions of the LDA be removed or reduced as that will honestly play a real and vital role in delivering much needed homes.<\/p><p> Why would one set up an agency and then tie one of its hands behind its back?  It does not make any sense, frankly.  This may point to the fundamental difference in delivery versus dogmatism.  I have tried to outline that having a land development agency that cannot develop or build is an oxymoron.  For those reasons, I must oppose these amendments.  They are fundamental.  I see them as a potential mechanism to stymie the agency and that is not something we can countenance in Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#A01300","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

As the Minister said, the debate around these amendments relates to the fundamental differences between the Government and many in the Opposition in terms of what a land development agency should do.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that the Minister mentioned the Shanganagh Castle development as an example of a fundamental difference.  Shanganagh Castle shows exactly that the LDA is now replacing the role of the local authority.  To put the Minister straight, the Opposition parties certainly did not delay the development of Shanganagh Castle.  I was campaigning to get public housing on the Shanganagh site from the moment it was handed over by the Department of Justice to the local authority 15 years ago. <\/p> <p>  Since then and up until now, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has continued to be run by a combination of Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael-led councils.  In all those years I campaigned to get public housing on that site, we never got a sod turned.  Some of the time, it was because of the lack of enthusiasm from the Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael-led councils.  Most of the time, it was a combination of that with the failure of central government to offer any money to do it anyway.  I can, however, tell the Minister that those of us who now feel there needs to be a different role for the LDA were precisely the ones who were campaigning for public and affordable housing on that site.<\/p> <p>  Of course, what delayed it was the policy that was introduced, of which the LDA is the latest and most developed example, of insisting that private money came in on the development of the site.  There was an established pathway to sourcing money for the solely public development of a site whereby one applied to central government, which approved money because it was public housing.<\/p><p>What has stymied and slowed it to the point where we still do not have a sod turned 15 years on was the insistence that in some shape or form the site had to be marketised and private finance had to be brought in.  Then we had years of Departments and local authorities scratching their heads and asking how they can make it work if they bring private finance in.  Private finance completely skews the pitch because it has a completely different objective and approach from what a local authority has and to the way local authorities traditionally build public housing.  It ends up in a scenario with all these different tenure types, different financing models, different notions of affordability, references to the market and all the stuff that has been crystallised in the Minister's Bill.  The LDA is substituting for the local authorities, it is delaying the delivery of public and affordable housing and it is effectively a marketising of public land with the replete references in this Bill to local market conditions, market rents, market prices and all the things that should not be relevant at all to the development of the public land bank.<\/p><p> What should the Land Development Agency do rather than what the Minister is proposing it will do?  It should aggressively go after the speculators, land hoarders and people sitting on vacant buildings.  It is infuriating to people when they look at empty buildings being sat on by speculators and investors.  They want the State's Land Development Agency to go after these people and take the empty buildings and zoned building land they are sitting on and drip feeding into the market at a pace that suits them to keep land prices up and essentially manipulate the market.  That is what we want a Land Development Agency to do.  That was the general thrust of the Kenny report many years ago.  We do not want a Land Development Agency as a substitute for the local authorities or to marketise public land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#B00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy &Oacute; Broin to respond on amendments Nos. 13, 33, 34 and 77.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#C00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I will speak to the three amendments of mine.

They did so because of really good work by councillors from all parties and none, including my party colleague, Shane O'Brien, who was formerly on the council.  Not once has any council member of any party delayed that development.  The delay first arose because former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, would not fund D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to deliver the scheme the councillors unanimously agreed some years ago.  Then, because of the LDA's involvement, it was delayed even further.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council had been the lead agency in that scheme and it put in the planning application.  It was the county architect who did all of the heavy lifting, and as that scheme progresses, the LDA will have to hire in consultants and project managers etc., many of which the local authority has in house.  In fairness, the Minister is not responsible for this delay but it was his predecessor who delayed Shanganagh Castle.<\/p> <p>  The two difficulties we have with that development are that the cost of the affordable cost rental properties are very high at &euro;1,200 per unit.  The design standards for the apartments are for smaller build-to-rent apartments, which is problematic, and we still do not know the price of the affordable purchase homes, which is genuinely problematic for folks.<\/p> <p>  With respect to Kilcarbery in my constituency, which the Minister mentioned, that is a good argument as to why the model the Minister is outlining in this Bill should not proceed.  We should keep in mind that Kilcarbery is not an LDA site.  Again, the previous Government would not fund a development on that site with 30% social housing, 30% affordable rental housing and 30% affordable purchase housing, for which we campaigned for years, and so South Dublin County Council was left in the situation of selling 70% of the land to a private developer.  None of the homes on that site will be genuinely affordable because the local infrastructure housing activation fund money will be used to give a small discount on the market price of some of the homes for sale but they will still be in excess of &euro;300,000 and the bulk of those homes will be pushing up towards &euro;400,000.  That is the market price there.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also mentioned cost rental and, again, this is an interesting example of how backward Government policy is on this because South Dublin County Council was forced to sell that land at open market value.  A developer bought that land and built out houses and now the Minister, through the cost rental equity loan, has given an approved housing body money to buy back, at full market value, a property to then rent out at cost rental.  The consequence of that is that the rents are too high.  Those rents should be well below &euro;900, particularly out in the suburbs, but I estimate that they will be somewhere in the region of &euro;1,200, which is not far off some of the market rents in those areas.<\/p> <p>  There is this mad situation where the Government had public land which it could have built on.  It could have rented out and sold those homes at genuinely affordable prices and it has failed to do so.  The only delay I am aware of on any site, and this is directly relevant to these amendments because it may become a site the LDA is interested in, is Oscar Traynor Road.  As the Minister knows, a majority of Dublin City Council councillors, including those from Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats, left-wing parties, Independents and half the Fianna F&aacute;il team, voted against a proposal that would have seen a significant number of the homes there sold at unaffordable open market prices.  Councillors have worked hard and have worked up an alternative proposal.  My understanding is that the mayor, Councillor Hazel Chu, and the chair of the strategic policy committee, the Labour Party's Councillor Alison Gilliland, have forwarded that to the Minister and have repeatedly been trying to get a response from him to see if he will fund that development.  If the Minister funded that development, 100% of the homes on that site would be affordable instead of 50% of them, and it is questionable whether 50% of homes will be affordable.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is right that these amendments up to No. 75 show the difference but the delay in all of these sites is down to ten years of delay on the Fine Gael side.  We need to hear from the Minister that where a local authority has a site and where there is a majority or unanimous support from elected members to develop a fully affordable scheme with genuinely affordable prices at that site, we need to step up to the plate and fund it.  The difficulty with the LDA Bill and with these sections we are trying to amend is that if this goes through, not only will those developments be further delayed like in Shanganagh but the cost to buy and rent the homes will be way above what modest income working families and many other families can afford.  Therefore, I will be pressing all of these amendments up to No. 75.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#C00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":828,"content":"<p>It is interesting, and as we go through these amendments, we have to make some progress in the debate.

There is an assumption that the way things have been done for the past ten years is the way the Minister intends to do things going forward.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the wording of the legislation itself, it does not relate to any of the things the two previous speakers have spoken about.  There is an assumption they will be in all cases private, for-profit and specific purpose vehicles.  I am not sure how one could deliver affordability with that and therefore I am not sure how a Government would put that forward as a proposal.  It is not the intention of the Government that we would squeeze profit out of the land because then we would not be able to deliver affordable homes for the people who we want to deliver them for.  It is a bizarre concept that a Government whose job it is to deliver affordable housing for people would in some way side with private, for-profit international finance rather than the people they are elected by.  I appreciate that suits the narrative of our two previous speakers, but if we look to the actual wording of the Bill in front of us. it would seek to do something fundamental.  It would seek essentially to establish a quango that pulls together banks of land and acts as some sort of middleman between that land being developed and local authorities that do not have the capacity to develop it.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps those in Opposition do not realise it but we have a real capacity issue.  We need all cylinders firing and that includes the LDA, the local authorities and the approved housing bodies all in operation.  I just cannot fathom the idea of preventing the LDA from building homes.<\/p><p>Why would we prevent a body from developing homes when we know we need both local authorities and the LDA developing?  There has been a large amount of discussions on some developments here and council decisions.  Having served on a council, one only sometimes really know why a decision is made at council if one actually attended the debate.<\/p><p> Let us be honest, specific purpose vehicles are well used by our local authority sector.  The last time Fianna F&aacute;il was in government we built many thousands of homes in Ballymun using a specific purpose vehicle, which was Ballymun regeneration.  There was no private element to that at all.  For us to do what the amendment suggests would limit our ability to deliver and reduce the number of affordable homes that could be delivered.  There is no reference to the make up of the designated activity company or DAC so to remove the power of anybody to use a specific purpose vehicle, when we know that they are well established, would stymie progress and delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#C00400","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":830,"content":"<p>Deputy McAuliffe has covered the issue really well.

We have had a masterclass in sophistry from the Minister and of course he thoroughly misrepresented the situation.  The original proposals, quite a long way back, for the development of Shanganagh were to have private development.  The People Before Profit Party in particular tabled motions insisting that the development would only be public and affordable.  Then there was a big battle on the council and eventually that position was won.  The original plan, even before the LDA, was to have some of the site privately developed.  Yes, we, through campaigning and very significant local public anger at the thought that the site would be in any way privatised, forced a position where there was finally a commitment that the site would only comprise public and affordable housing.<\/p><p><font color=\"#4F4F4F\">  What I am worried about, given the make up of the LDA, is that the victory in establishing that the Shanganagh site will only be public and affordable will unravel because of the insistence in this Bill about relating affordability and rents to local market conditions thus rendering references to &quot;affordable&quot; meaningless in the context of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency.  Of course, our rents and market houses prices are so off the Richter scale that about 99% of working people are excluded from the market.  If, as this Bill proposes, that affordable purchase, affordable or, indeed, even rents, as the Bill explicitly states, are related to local market rents and prices then the affordable will not be affordable either in terms of house prices or rents.  So that is why, just to explain to the Minister, my later amendment is an attempt to put an insurance policy in against what the LDA might do to a hard-won position of establishing Shanganagh as a 100% public and affordable site.

I, my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and other people in the Opposition proposed the development of this site back in 2013.  The site is being developed now by the LDA but we still do not have a breakdown of how much is going to be affordable, affordable cost-rental or purchase, social and private.  I am a Deputy for Cork North-Central yet I still do not know what the breakdown is.<\/p> <p>  There was an announcement at one of our housing meetings where it was said that the rental income will be between &euro;900 and &euro;1,000.  For the people of Cork North-Central whom I represent, that rental figure is not affordable cost-rental or affordable for people.  The Government is using the concept of giving a discount on the market value, and this goes to the whole crux of where we are coming from.  Affordability should not be based on market value.  It should be based on what is actually affordable for people.  If we are saying that it should be a maximum of between 30% and 35% of a person's income then how can we say this is affordable if we are using the market as the guide?  It is wrong for the Minister to say that we are trying to delay things when the Fine Gael Government, that was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, sat on its hands for years while I and all of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues sought the development of this site and other sites.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Cork City Council cried out for funding for years to develop sites.

First, because the LDA, as designed by Fine Gael, was to become a residential developer, it could not have significant active land management powers.  Earlier the Minister said that the Bill has compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers.  It does but they were always going to be in this Bill.<\/p><p>We were told by the former Minister, former Deputy Eoghan Murphy, it was his intention to put them in.  Those compulsory purchase order powers are only for small ransom strips to unlock development on public land and therefore one of the crucial functions of an active land management agency is to have strong CPO powers to ensure reluctant participants in better use of public land can be forced to the table.<\/p><p> The reason the Land Development Agency, as currently constituted, cannot do active land management in a serious way is that it would breach state aid rules and it would end up in the European Court of Justice challenged, as the National Asset Management Agency was, by other developers.  That crucial function that every body tasked by the Government to look at this question has been calling for over decades cannot happen as a result.<\/p><p> Deputy McAuliffe seems to think an active land management agency would just be some kind of quango or intermediary.  The National Economic Social Council, a function of the Department of the Taoiseach, has repeatedly called for and produced detailed documents arguing why an active land management agency would be central to tackling the unfortunately too cyclical nature of our housing market.  Likewise, other agencies have indicated that having an active land management agency, which would be powerful and well-resourced, to deal with land issues is crucial in moderating private prices as well as public sector development.<\/p><p> The other problem with having the Land Development Agency is that it splits the cost rental from social properties.  Dublin councillors have not agreed to transfer the St. Teresa's Gardens site to the Land Development Agency, LDA, but it is on the LDA website as one of the potential development sites.  St. Teresa's Gardens looks like a really good project, at 30% social and 70% affordable rental.  The local authority did a good deal with Hines, an adjoining developer, to swap some land in exchange for community facilities, and I commend it on that.<\/p><p> Dublin City Council is discussing bringing in the LDA to deliver that site because it would be faster as the LDA does not have to adhere to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's four-stage approval, tendering and procurement process and the public spending code to the same extent.  The consequence of bringing in the LDA means there is a split between the social rentals, brought back as turnkey projects by the local authority, which will manage them, and the cost rental projects that will be managed by the LDA.  At a certain point, those LDA cost rental units will generate a revenue surplus, and in all other countries with a cost rental model, that revenue surplus goes back to the overall housing provider to help manage and maintain the stock into the future.  Separating cost rental and social rental makes no sense.<\/p><p> This would also increase the cost of development.  The LDA will bring a certain private sector ethos and, in some cases, private sector or equity finance alongside its capitalisation.  That will make units more expensive and push up rents and house prices.  It is why the agency cannot tell us what is the sale price of the affordable purchase homes in Shanganagh Castle in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.<\/p><p> To correct the Minister's comment, there shall be no homes complete and ready next year at the Shanganagh Castle site.  Representatives of the LDA came in front of this committee and told us the first phase will be delivered in 2023 and it will be approximately a third of the scheme at 200 to 300 units.  There shall be further phases in 2024 and 2025.  The output for the LDA is looking exceptionally poor and that is the problem with it.<\/p><p> There is nothing wrong with Deputy Boyd Barrett being pragmatic and many of us will be pragmatic as we go through this.  We will table amendments to shape the legislation the way we would like it to be in an ideal format but we will also table other amendments - sometimes called defensive amendments - to at least improve what we think is a bad scheme.  When we get to the next group, we will see quite a number of those from me.<\/p><p> I do not want the LDA to be involved in residential development.  It is time we funded our local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts to do that.  If there is to be an LDA, I make no apology for tabling amendments to try to ensure it acts in ways it otherwise would not if left to the devices of the current Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#D00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":836,"content":"<p>Active land management is key and this is missing from the Irish context in housing delivery.

Is it because of EU state aid rules or is that a factor in the consideration of how the legislation has been drafted?

Deputy Gould spoke about cost rental and how it is framed.  I will welcome his party's support for the Affordable Housing Bill because cost rental will basically cover the cost of the development and maintenance of those properties, with rent set accordingly.  The Deputy continues to mention a discount on market value but that related to setting a guide for the first eight schemes being delivered within a year of the Government being established.  We are going to deliver eight cost rental schemes across the country, including in his own county of Cork.  That is something one would expect Deputies to welcome but obviously not in this instance.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to land management and assembly and the report of NESC and the national planning framework.  The Land Development Agency does exactly that and it will manage, assemble and develop.  It is quite a startling admission by Deputy &Oacute; Broin that he does not want the LDA involved in residential development.  In itself that is a very stark comment and people can now see that we will effectively have a State land development agency that would not be able to build if the Opposition got its way.  I speak specifically about Sinn F&eacute;in because these are Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  That can be put in the context of the very same Deputy saying he wants to deliver 20,000 public homes per annum, although he never says how, where or how long it would take.<\/p><p>Getting back to the reality, it is about how we deliver and get to the stage of building homes on public land.  It is intended that the Shanganagh Castle development will break ground this year and it will be very significant.  It is one of the nine significant sites that this agency has and I intend it to have many more while working in partnerships.<\/p><p>To respond to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's comments, the LDA at this stage has appropriate CPO powers for what it needs to do.  That is an important change from the last LDA draft Bill in the previous Oireachtas.  There are a number of changes in that regard that we will get to as we go through the Bill.<\/p><p>I will address amendments Nos. 44 and 46, which are tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould, along with amendment No. 45, which has been tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues, Deputies Gino Kenny, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Mick Barry.  I oppose the amendments as amendment No. 44 seeks to remove section 2(<i>r<\/i>), which enables the LDA to engage in commercial activities consistent with the parameters of the Bill.  Amendment No. 45 seeks to limit its commercial activities to the provision of social, affordable and cost rental housing.<\/p><p>The LDA has been set up as a commercial State body and its primary function is to develop but also to manage relevant public land, and where applicable, other lands for the provision of housing for the public good.  I see it expanding into that space.  It is wholly appropriate for the body to do that.  I reassure Deputies that any returns made by the LDA, as referred to by Deputies, will be reinvested in operations or returned to the Exchequer.  The legislation further provides that the only shareholders will be the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I oppose this amendment as by enabling the LDA to engage in commercial activities, it will have access to wider funding streams that will allow greater investment to achieve its aims and expand its functions.<\/p><p>That is something we should be seeking to do.  Should this legislation be passed by the Oireachtas, we will be able to capitalise the LDA through the ISIF to the tune of &euro;1.25 billion and further borrowing to an equivalent amount.  That is something I thought all Deputies would welcome because it allows the agency to get on with it.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 46 seeks to delete section 2(s).  This section provides that one of the purposes of the Bill shall be to achieve the best possible social and economic return from the use of relevant public land.  I oppose the amendment as the LDA is being entrusted with public land and it is appropriate that it should be required to achieve the best possible social and economic return on behalf of the people, with the focus being on the social return, that is, delivering both social and affordable homes on public land.  I said this on Second Stage as well.  I envisage the absolute predominance of the developments, particularly in urban centres, being up to 90% affordable and, indeed, a 100% mix of social and affordable.  That will happen, but it will only happen when we establish the agency with a primary legislative footing.  Development of much-needed affordable housing would be a beneficial social return, as would be the development of enabling infrastructure.  The LDA will be established as a commercial semi-State body and as such will be required to achieve a return on the investment made in it by its shareholders, the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a commercial semi-State body, under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, the LDA will be in receipt of a shareholder letter of expectation which will detail the return both Ministers will expect from their investment.<\/p><p> The agency will be governed by the public spending code, as members know, and will be fully subject to public procurement.

First, it is important to remember that the LDA was established in September 2018.  It will be five years before it delivers a single home.  That does not appear to suggest it has either the capacity, ability or the urgency to meet the challenges of the housing crisis.  In fact, if the former Deputy, Eoghan Murphy, had funded D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to develop Shanganagh Castle when the elected members of that local authority unanimously agreed on a very good scheme, people would be living in the first tranche of those homes today.  Therefore, the argument that it is quicker to set up a new State agency to deliver homes rather than funding the local authorities directly to deliver large-scale projects is simply not the case.<\/p> <p>  One of the worries I have about LDA sites, for example, the Dundrum central site, which will be one of the key ones in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, is that we do not know yet, because we cannot be told either by the Minister or the agency, how many or what percentage of the homes on that site will be at an unaffordable, open market price.  It is the same with the St. Kevin's HSE site in Cork.  If the Minister wants to know how we would dramatically increase the delivery of genuinely affordable homes, we should stop using public land to deliver unaffordable, open market price homes.  As the Minister knows, tonight there will be a special meeting of Fingal County Council to deal with the lands in Donabate for 1,200 much-needed homes.  The proposition from the local authority, essentially under instruction from the Department, is that 60% of those homes, almost 800, will be sold at open market prices.  The open market prices, according to the local authority, range from &euro;340,000 to &euro;450,000.  Why anybody would allow homes at that price to be built and sold on public land when we could ensure every home there was affordable to the electorate that elected the Minister and other Deputies makes very little sense.<\/p> <p>  The other big issue is that we were originally told that the LDA was going to deliver 7,500 homes per year and that it would deliver 150,000 social, affordable and private homes over 20 years.  However, according to the agency, and it gave this committee its pipeline figures a number of months ago, by 2025 when this Government is coming to the end of its term of office, if it gets that far, only a couple of thousand homes will be delivered by it and a portion of those will be unaffordable private houses.<\/p> <p>  There is one final matter, and it is important that the Minister clarifies this.  My understanding is that the Department's four-stage approval, tendering and procurement process will not apply to the LDA in the same way as it would apply to the local authority because there will be a designated activities company or subsidiary.  My point was not that the public spending code does not apply, but that it does not apply in the same way.  Therefore, local authority officials will say that, from their point of view, if there is an advantage to transferring the delivery of a project to the LDA, it is that it dramatically reduces the bureaucracy and staff time for them.  If that is the case, and I believe it is, why not just reform that process, remove the bureaucracy from the local authorities and give them the funding to deliver?  They are much better placed to deliver these projects if only they were assisted to do so.  On that basis, I am only more convinced of the legitimacy of the amendments I have proposed, having heard the Minister's replies.  I will press the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#F00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I will address the specific block of amendments first.  To be clear, the LDA will have to be fully compliant with public procurement and the public spending code.  The four-stage approval process is a different matter.  I have altered the four-stage approval process for local authorities, as the Deputy knows.  The single stage can be used up to &euro;6 million, and I will seek to review that further in respect of the housing for all plan.  That has been done in a short time.  It is telling that every housing development mentioned by the Deputy was opposed by his party.  It is remarkable that it always seems to find some reason to oppose the delivery of homes.  The specific proposal he mentioned will deliver 238 affordable purchase homes and 238 social homes, which is a significant amount.  There are private homes in addition to that.  It will be a big decision for any party to oppose the delivery of such a significant amount of affordable and social homes, but that is a position people are entitled to take and it is for them to explain it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 84, 96 and 98 to 101, inclusive, tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould, amendment No. 84 seeks to amend section 13(1)(c), which deals with the LDA providing assistance to local authorities in the development of large-scale local authority owned sites for housing.  The amendment seeks to delete the word \"develop\".  It is appropriate that the LDA would develop, or seek to develop, large-scale local authority sites.  However, to be clear about what is happening, the absolute predominance of delivery of social homes will be through the local authorities.  That is why they are being tooled and given the funding to do that, with the largest housing budget in the history of the State in budget 2021.  The LDA is doing this in Shanganagh, which we have discussed.  It is working in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to provide 600 social and affordable units.  <\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about the number of homes the LDA will deliver by 2025, we will see how many that will be, and I expect the agency to be ambitious.  However, we can be certain of one thing.  If Deputy &Oacute; Broin and his colleagues had their way with the amendments they wish to make to the Bill, the agency would deliver no homes.  They want to restrict the agency and say it should not build.  In some cases the LDA may develop a site on behalf of a local authority and, in others, it may work with the local authority to facilitate the development of the site.<\/p><p>Both provisions are necessary and are absolutely appropriate.  Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment as it would undermine the role of the LDA in assisting local authorities.  <\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 96, 98, 99, 100 and 101 seek to amend section 14 which sets out the detail as to how the LDA will provide services to local authorities.  Amendment No. 96 seeks to limit the services that the LDA will provide to \"land and land related\" while amendments Nos. 98 to 101, inclusive, seek to limit the role of the LDA to providing assistance to local authorities in the preparation of master plans, applying for development consents, providing housing and managing cost rental housing.  It is wholly appropriate that the LDA would provide these services to local authorities and not just assist them in that.  We must be realistic about where we are right now in terms of the delivery of homes for our people.  We need change in the housing area and this Bill represents change.  If we keep doing the same thing, we will have the same results.  We need to tool up these agencies to do the job and it is wholly appropriate to give them these powers.  <\/p><p> One of the purposes of the Bill is that the LDA would provide services to local authorities and support them in their role as housing authorities.  Local authorities will be able to avail of the centre of excellence which we want to see developed in the LDA for the delivery of housing in urban areas which is something that we really need.  Most people will see that there are different levels of expertise in different local authorities.  We need to build that expertise up and ensure that we have an agency in place that can assist.  Therefore, I cannot accept these amendments as they would undermine the role of the LDA in delivering services to local authorities.  That covers amendments Nos. 84, 96 and 98 to 101, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#F00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":843,"content":"<p>That just leaves amendment No. 227 in this group and I invite Deputy Boyd Barrett to speak on same.

This is all about something that we all allegedly agree on, that is, delivering homes for people who need them.  Surely we all want to make the most of State-owned land that is lying idle.

We would be stripping it of such significant powers and denying it a role in the development of housing.  It is wholly appropriate that the LDA would be a development agency in relation to sites that are relevant public lands or land owned by it.  Designating the LDA as a development agency will permit it to develop planning schemes and enter into agreements with parties to develop strategic development zones, SDZs, on relevant public lands and lands in its ownership.  I want to be really clear that it does not confer any planning consent role on the LDA.  I would point out the role of the LDA as a development agency is limited to these circumstances and it will not have the full range of development agency powers that are assigned to a local authority.

The reason for this is very simple.  There is a notion, which has been peddled for a very long time, that if we just increase the supply of housing, the prices will become affordable.  This is an ideological notion, to use a term that Deputy Higgins used earlier on.  It is not based on reality whatsoever.  The clearest example that increasing supply does not lead to reductions in price or produce affordable housing is the Celtic tiger.<\/p><p>During the Celtic tiger we had housing supply at unprecedented levels, with some 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year being built during that period.  Did prices go down?  Not at all.  They went up because the housing was not being built to provide public, affordable or social housing but to make profit.  Those who were looking to make profit completely controlled the housing sector and during that same period when we had unprecedented levels of supply in the general sense, albeit profit-driven supply, we also had pretty much the turning off of the tap of direct build social housing on public land, starting with Fianna F&aacute;il and then carrying on through with Fine Gael Governments.  It is not an ideological point.  It is a statement of fact that increasing supply, no matter how great that supply is - and we had the greatest supply in the history of the State during the Celtic tiger - did zero to deliver public, social and affordable housing.  It did exactly the opposite and then it crashed the entire economy.<\/p><p> The whole point about the utilisation of the public land bank is that developing not-for-profit housing to deliver public and affordable housing is the only way to keep prices down, not only to deliver public and affordable housing on public land but also to dampen the entire market.  That is the purpose of these amendments.  It is to ensure that we do not repeat the disastrous mistakes that have been made in the private housing sector over recent years on the public land bank and to make sure the public land bank is used for what it should be used for.  It should be used to serve the interests of the public, specifically those who are on the housing waiting lists or those who cannot even get on those waiting lists because their incomes are higher than the social housing thresholds but whose incomes would not allow them to buy at the grossly inflated house prices that are available in the private market or rent at the grossly inflated rents that exist out there in the private market.  The sole purpose and usage of the public land bank should be to do that.<\/p><p> The other important point to make is that we want affordable housing.  Insofar as we have affordable purchase housing, we want it to be affordable in perpetuity so that no part of the public land bank will ever be marketised.  Even if people have the right to purchase affordable housing on the public land bank, it should be the case that they would have to sell it back to the local authority and that the profit would not be made from affordable purchase housing that was delivered on public land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#J00600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Oacute; Broin wish to speak on amendment No. 2 and the related amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#K00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I would like to fully support amendment No. 2 and to speak to my amendment No. 3, which is broadly trying to do the same thing.  This is an important and key element of the Bill and it is where the Opposition is united in trying to ensure that the maximum number of affordable homes are delivered on any site that is being developed by the Land Development Agency.<\/p> <p>  In his response to me when we were discussing the last group of amendments, the Minister made the claim that Opposition parties, including my own, are opposing housing developments across the city of Dublin.  The Minister knows that is not true.  We have not opposed a single housing development in planning for housing, particularly social and affordable housing.  I can only think of one major housing development that was opposed in a vote in a local authority in Dublin recently and that is Clonburris in my constituency where 8,000 to 11,000 homes were proposed with 2,500 social and affordable homes.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael groups not only voted against that development but when Deputy Higgins was the Fine Gael group leader on the council at the time she appealed it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, delaying it by almost a year.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander I suppose.<\/p> <p>  What we are saying here is that public land should not be used for unaffordable open market priced homes.  Therefore, what the Opposition has done in a number of local authorities - and we stand over this - is that we have opposed the transfer of land to private developers.  In many cases that land was below market value or for free, where large volumes of the homes on that land will be delivered at prices of &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000.  That is what these amendments are about.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned Donabate and asked why anybody would vote against that land transfer.  No market valuation has been made of the land there.  It will go to the developer, if the vote is approved tonight, for about half the market value and 60%, or almost 800 of the homes, will be sold at average prices of &euro;400,000.  I do not know how anybody could stand over such an inappropriate use of public land.<\/p> <p>  What my amendment does is straightforward.  Notwithstanding my fundamental opposition to the LDA as a residential developer, if it is to be a residential developer then it should not be building anything other than affordable purchase, affordable rental and social homes.  It is interesting, for example, that the councillors on Dublin City Council proposed an alternative and fully public development on Oscar Traynor Road.  As I said, Fine Gael councillors abstained on that because somehow they do not support the idea of all homes on that site being affordable.  It would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether he intends to support the request from the majority of Dublin City Council councillors to fund that development to allow it to be developed speedily so that every single one of the 800 plus homes on Oscar Traynor Road will be genuinely affordable to purchase or rent, as well as 30% of the homes there being social houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#K00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":865,"content":"<p>As Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett have stated, the reason for these amendments is our concern that public land is being siphoned off to the private sector.

These people are trapped in the middle with high rents and being unable to save.  They need affordable homes.  Those homes should be delivered by local authorities.  If the LDA Bill goes ahead and if we cannot stop it, then we want it to be truly focused on people who need affordability, either in cost rental or affordable purchase.  That is why we want to change the Bill and that is why these amendments have been put forward.<\/p> <p>  To give the Minister and the Government parties some insight, in my maiden speech in Cork City Council in 2009, I outlined the housing crisis.  At that meeting, I was attacked by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors for grandstanding and for trying to create hysteria when there was no housing crisis.  The difference between Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties in the Opposition and the Government parties is that we knew there was a housing crisis because we were talking to people on the ground.  Now we have the Government 12 years later, saying it wants to tackle the housing crisis and saying that the Opposition is not engaging in the process to deliver truly affordable homes.

Section 2(a) of the Bill, as published, states that the purpose of the Bill is, \"to enable urgent measures to be taken to increase the supply of housing in the State and in particular affordable and social housing\".  That is pretty clear on what we want to do.  The amendment from Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues seeks,  to insert \"public and affordable\".  That is in the Bill already.  The same goes for the amendment from Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould.<\/p><p>I do not want to get into a back and forth discussion with colleagues about how they believe they are not delaying, objecting to or stymying housing developments at council level.  The people know what the situation is in that regard.  The purpose of this legislation is to progress matters and get the State delivering and building.  It is remarkable that Deputy &Oacute; Broin has again said that he is fundamentally opposed to the LDA, which is a State company, building homes.  One would have believed that, for someone who purports to want to deliver 20,000 public homes per year but will not say where, by whom and how, a State land development agency that delivers social, affordable and cost rental homes at scale would be viewed as necessary.  That is what we need to do.  I will remind colleagues that the State is the largest builder and part of the housing market.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that this is not just about supply, but the right supply.  That is why the Affordable Housing Bill passed Second Stage in the Seanad last night.  It is the most significant affordable housing legislation ever introduced and will deal with affordable purchases through shared equity on State-owned lands, provide cost rental at scale through the first national cost rental scheme in the history of the State, and introduce provisions expanding Part V to protect the 10% of social housing in private developments while adding a further 10% affordable housing.  These are mechanisms that deliver the right type of supply.  The State is intervening.  The Deputy regularly talks about the State having a role to play in housing, and he is right.  Here is an opportunity to support the State's involvement through a State agency building housing.  It seems that, in every instance, members of the Opposition will seek to oppose, not what we are trying to do, but what we are going to do to help delivery this year through the Affordable Housing Bill and this Bill.  We need to get on with that.<\/p><p> I oppose these amendments because there are already clear references - I have cited an example - to affordable and social housing in this section, as there are in multiple sections.

On the council, Sinn F&eacute;in voted against Kilcarbery with its 975 homes.  The Minister and I visited the site last week.  It was great to see progress being made there, builders on site and homes being delivered despite how Sinn F&eacute;in stood on the issue.  Lindisfarne and its 19 homes arose earlier this year.  It is difficult to forget that one.  Sinn F&eacute;in voted against even progressing to master plan stage in respect of Killinarden and its 500 homes.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy well knows, I believe that the Clonburris plan that Sinn F&eacute;in councillors voted for did not deliver enough infrastructure with its housing to serve what will be a growing community - a town the size of Wexford wedged between Lucan and Clondalkin.  In my submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I clearly stated that the lands should be developed and that I agreed with the overall vision of Clonburris but that vision needed to be linked with the delivery of infrastructure, for example, the provision of a Garda station or a site to be earmarked for same, which Sinn F&eacute;in councillors voted against.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#L00200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I will address the legislation before us because we have spent much of the morning debating council decisions, which relate to previous policies.  This Bill is about a new Government putting in place new policies to set a new direction in housing.  There are two elements to those policies - the Minister rightly spoke about the Affordable Housing Bill, and the second is this Bill.  Deputy Gould should read the former, as everything he called for, or discussed calling for in his maiden speech all those years ago, is in the Affordable Housing Bill.  They are the tools the councils need to develop lands.<\/p> <p>  The amendments seek to rephrase what is in the Bill.  A number of Opposition Deputies and Senators have misunderstood what the Bill is about, that is, taking public lands with a market value and permanently devaluing them so that the land cost can be eliminated from providing homes, effectively giving those lands a nominal value regardless of who owns them.  It ensures that, as homes are built on these lands in accordance with the Bill and other mechanisms, the land cost will not contribute to the cost of those homes.  The Bill represents the largest single permanent devaluation of the cost of land.<\/p> <p>  I can find no reference in the Bill that speaks to Deputy Boyd Barrett's fears that this is about the privatisation of land.  I have combed through it and the amendments and I cannot see where they allow the State to give large tracts of public land to a private developer to make a profit.  If anything, the Bill attaches a permanent devaluation mechanism that ensures that, as the Minister said, the land value in places such as Dublin will effectively be nominal because of the cost of building.  The mechanism outlined in the Bill is clear but, in some of these amendments, we are dancing on the head of a pin to be seen to rephrase something that is already in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#L00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":871,"content":"<p>It would be helpful if we did not rehash every single vote that has taken place at a council over the past few years, although there might be a temptation to do so.

I put up a hand, but it does not matter.<\/p> <p>  I need to set the record straight.  I presume that Deputy McAuliffe, who is referring to the Bill, has read it.  The Bill very clearly refers to the setting of affordable prices and rents and relating them to discounts on local market conditions.  It refers to the establishment of DACs for the different parcels of land that will be developed.  It also refers to commercial activity.  Without a shadow of a doubt, all of these elements marketise the land.  Why would one relate affordability to local market conditions?  They are not even average market conditions.  If we averaged out rents and prices across the places in the country with high rents and house prices and those parts with low rents and prices, we would get a bad enough figure for affordability, but the Bill refers to local market conditions.  In all of the areas where the affordability and housing crises are at their most intense, this would be a disastrous benchmark against which to set affordability.  Average rents in my area are anywhere between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000.  Average house prices are between &euro;500,000 and &euro;600,000.  Benchmarking affordability against local market conditions means that, even if there was a 20% discount, a price would be unaffordable for the vast majority of people.<\/p><p>Affordability has to be benchmarked against income.  A teacher's pay is no different in D&uacute;n Laoghaoire than in Leitrim.  The pay of a nurse, a council worker or a bus worker is not different because he or she happens to live in a different part of the country.  Affordability has to be benchmarked against people's actual income but this Bill opens up the public land bank to develop housing that is linked to market conditions, private finance and to commercial imperatives around designated activity companies.  We are not scaremongering when we say that this is the marketisation of the public land bank and an opening of the door to the privatisation of that landbank; it is there, in the Bill.  Our amendments, which all work in conjunction with each other, aim to protect the public land bank against marketisation and to ensure that it is used solely to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing, with affordability benchmarked against people's income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#L00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I appreciate the bona fides of Deputy Boyd Barret's contribution but I wish to clarify what I just said because the Deputy is conflating the term \"affordability\" in two different Bills.  Affordability is set out in the Affordable Housing Bill to allow councils to build homes on public land and the LDA will do the same.  That is dealt with in the Affordable Housing Bill.  In this Bill, the affordability percentage is a mechanism which is being used to devalue land that has a commercial or market value.  The land currently has a market value and we are applying an affordability percentage to that land and as a result, because it is below the market value and the costs of construction are there, the land effectively has no tradeable, real market value on the open market.  Therefore, we are eliminating the land costs and that is what the Bill is doing.  It is not a neat or pretty way of doing it but because we want it to develop and because we want to comply with EU state aid rules, we are doing that so that the land cost is eliminated from the overall cost when the LDA or the councils take up the obligation to build affordable housing.  What we are doing here is making sure that the land cost is eliminated.  That is done by applying the affordability percentage.  The land already has a market value and therefore, when we refer to market value in the Bill, we are naming its existing value.  It is clear that when we talk about market value, we are naming the current value of the land; it has a value.  When we talk about affordability, we are talking about a mechanism to reduce the land costs because we do not want the land to be traded openly on the open market, regardless of who owns it.  The mechanism will eliminate the cost of land in the development of housing by the LDA, the councils and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#M00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I now invite the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#M00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":876,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin has his l&aacute;mh suas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#M00400","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":877,"content":"<p>My apologies.

It may be helpful for Deputy McAuliffe if we deal with the issues he raises at the relevant section of the Bill because many of us would like to contribute to that discussion.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak on amendments Nos. 41 and 213 now.  One of the big concerns I have with the section of the Bill dealt with in amendment No.41 is that it is giving the LDA the power to develop master plans and designs.  The LDA is not equipped to do that and has great difficulty in employing staff to do that job.  It also has no democratically accountable mechanism for approving that.  Local authorities are best placed, through their planning departments and their elected members, to develop plans for sites.  We see that, for example, in SDZs and Local Area Plans, LAPs.  There is some discussion among planning professionals about the innovative idea of local development zones, of which I am very much in favour.  Why we would give a State agency that has no knowledge of the affairs in different local authorities, the housing markets and the local realities, a centralised power when it does not have any history of doing that and deny that to the agencies that the State has funded to provide those master plans over a long period of time is beyond me.  <\/p> <p>  There is a value in talking about some developments in local areas because it allows us to talk about this in real time.  One of the great values of Shanganagh was that the LDA did not master plan it.  The local authority did the master plan on foot of consultation with elected members and so on.  I see no set of reasons for the LDA being involved in master planning.  That is a function of our planning authorities.  They are equipped, skilled and have a track record in doing it which is why I am proposing that we remove that section.  <\/p> <p>  The remainder of my amendments in this section go back to the central point that if the LDA is to be a residential developer, it should only develop affordable homes, that is, homes for affordable purchase, affordable rental and social rental.  It should not be in the business of using very scarce and valuable public land to build homes that will sell for between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000 or in the case of the Dundrum central site, up to &euro;500,000.  That is not good housing policy and that is why those amendments are attempting to constrain the LDA, if it is residentially developing, to 100% affordable homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052500002#M00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I will respond quickly on those amendments.  I have already responded to two.  Amendments Nos. 41 to 43 are another example of stripping functions from the LDA, which is a State-owned agency to develop and manage our own lands.  It is clear from the short two hours of discussion we have had today that Sinn F&eacute;in does not want the LDA to build any homes or to plan to build any homes or any infrastructure.  If Sinn F&eacute;in had its way, we would be left with a skeleton and would have nothing of any relevance.  We need to get on with the job in hand.  I cannot accept these amendments tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould.<\/p> <p>  The section provides for the establishment of the LDA and ensures that in the performance of its functions, economies of scale and efficiencies are achieved through a single entity providing services such as preparation of master plans, design and project management.  This is in addition to local authorities but not instead of them.  Local authorities will still be delivering the vast bulk of social homes.  This is about all of the other lands that we have been talking about that are not being used and about allowing the agency to have the ability to plan for their use.  It would be incongruous, if not incredible, not to allow the agency to do that.  It does not make sense.  I am opposing these amendments because the LDA has been and will be tasked with providing services for the preparation of master plans, design and project management.  That is its mandate.  The LDA employs experienced staff with extensive skills to do those various tasks, to complement the work of the very experienced and exceptional staff in our local authorities.

I am the chief executive and co-founder of Ward Solutions, one of the largest indigenous, dedicated cybersecurity companies in Ireland.  We spend our time helping a wide range of commercial, public sector, government and other organisations from a wide variety of sectors on the island of Ireland to secure their people, data and systems from malicious and inadvertent threat.  Prior to this I had the privilege to serve my country as an officer of the Irish Defence Forces at home and overseas with the UN.<\/p> <p>  Since our foundation in 1999, Ward Solutions has witnessed a number of things that are relevant to the committee's purpose here today.  Ireland's citizens, organisations and society have transformed to a sophisticated and prosperous digital economy, with a very significant digital dependency.  Significant technology and born in the cloud sectors have emerged indigenously and through foreign direct investment to a point where Ireland now holds upwards of 30% of European cloud data in data centres located on the island.<\/p> <p>  The dramatic digital transformation of traditional bricks and mortar organisations, including government, led to a very high digital dependency based on accessing and servicing the markets via digital channels.  A lot of business and wealth now located in Ireland has digital roots and is, therefore, much more portable as distinct from less portable legacy business.  This portable business and wealth can easily relocate to countries that are in a position to appropriately secure it.<\/p> <p>  In the field of cybersecurity we have witnessed the emergence of cybersecurity on global, national and corporate risk registers, consistently as one of the top three risks, along with climate change and global pandemic, and the increasing occurrence of all three risks.  We have witnessed the relentless increase in the scale, sophistication, and effectiveness of attacks directed against individuals, organisations and the State from criminals, hacktivists and militia to a point where the financial scale of cyber crime at &euro;6 trillion annually has overtaken the global illicit narcotics trade.<\/p> <p>  Organisations are increasingly challenged to protect themselves from inadvertent or non-malicious cyber events that similarly threaten their survival or prosperity.  There is a global shortage of cybersecurity talent, estimated to be about 3.2 million professionals by 2022.  The cybersecurity market emerged as a massive opportunity for Irish companies, conservatively estimated to be worth $173 billion in 2020, and growing to $270 billion by 2026.  There is an emergence of a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We work with our clients through the full cybersecurity lifecycle of assess, protect, detect and respond.  There is one absolute observable trend that we and our industry generally notice.  Clients who invest and adopt a systemic approach to their cybersecurity posture, who work to move from an immature approach to a fully optimised approach, suffer from the same hostile environment but are typically breached less.  When breached, optimised clients respond quicker and better and thus suffer less impact and cost to their business.  Cyber-optimised organisations treat cybersecurity as a journey, not a destination.<\/p> <p>  Ireland now needs a fundamental acceleration of our approach to national cybersecurity.  We have a society worth defending and we need politically and societally to move towards a national defence mindset with our national cybersecurity as one of the key pillars of our defence.  We need to move to leading and developing national and global consensus, to collaboration on cyber law, norms, ethics and behaviour, and to the global enforcement of same.  We need a full-blooded, joined-up, coherent and committed strategy for our defence, encompassing all government, national security and intelligence, industry, academic and research resources, to out gun the cyber bad actors.  We need to adopt a ten-year goal of making Ireland the cybersecurity capital of Europe.  We can do this by developing a world-class cybersecurity ecosystem in Ireland so we have the resources in country to secure ourselves.  In doing so, Ireland also stands the possibility of benefiting from a rapidly growing cyber marketplace, estimated to be worth $270 billion by 2026.  We need to raise our game nationally from an immature to an optimised approach to cybersecurity, to protect our citizens, our government and our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":892,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Larkin.

The Colonial pipeline attack, which may have been in the news in Ireland, shook up a large portion of American society.  It really hits individuals where they live and is escalating prices for gas.  It has had a direct impact on the citizenry.  Over here we also have health services getting attacked.  We do not have a national health service but we have prescription and hospital concerns.  A hospital in San Diego is currently struggling with ransomware.  We had more than 200 attacks on hospital chains last year also.<\/p> <p>  I will talk a little about my background and my perspective.  I started the company five years ago with the chief information security officer of Schneider Electric.  His expertise was primarily in cyber and operational technology.  My expertise was in financial modelling.  I bulked out a software product that operationalises regulation standards, like the NIS directive.  From what I have seen on the inside, my concern across many sectors is in accordance with what I have just heard, which is that there is some variance with regard to maturity and work in depth with the energy industry, the finance industry and across almost every sector.  We see the increase in frequency of ransomware and the increase in ransoms, which is quite alarming.  Maturity levels vary greatly.  With the pipeline Colonial tech we are dealing with the learnings here in the US.  The Administration here came out immediately with an executive order that sought to address some of the gaps that remain.<\/p><p>We have a sprawling regulatory regime here so when I work with the energy industry it is under something we call NERC CIP, which is a legacy set of standards that relate to the grid.  The pipeline industry is under a voluntary set of standards, so there is real variance between practitioners and companies within the energy industry.  One can see the results quite clearly.  We do not see that the organisations under strictly voluntary standards do a great deal of adoption.  That is not the case for all of them, of course, but we have learned over here, with the threat of going from cyber to physical in the pipeline industry hack, that the government and the Department of Energy are now re-evaluating whether to actively police or regulate the pipelines.  It is always a question.  The question comes down to the fact that 85% of our public infrastructure is in private hands.  Private infrastructure companies tend to live quarter to quarter.  They do not always put into practice some of the standards that are quite clear.<\/p><p> When I was speaking on television last week, there was quite a gap in understanding about what one does with respect to cyber.  People tend to think it is extremely expensive because these are complicated systems.  Many things done in cyber that are practice and policy oriented and employment oriented are not overwhelmingly expensive.  Best practices are not always terribly expensive.  The pipeline attack looked like a remote desktop protocol, RDP, attack.  In an RDP attack, one can do two-factor authentication and do some other things with RDP that make it much harder for brute force attacks.  There is no way to know, however, if one does not have metrics.  We can talk about standards and best practices, but there must also be metrics.  When the network and information systems, NIS, directive came into play, there was a colloquium in Washington DC on metrics.  It was essentially taking the cybersecurity framework we operationalise in our software and driving metrics over it.  It was very controversial.  Many industries do not want metrics.

I am attending in an advisory capacity, as mentioned, to support with the recruitment of the extremely important new position of director of cyber security, DCS, with the National Cyber Security Centre.  It is worth mentioning that this role will be recognised nationally as chief information officer, which is relevant for what I will discuss next.  I have been invited here in my capacity as a professional and seasoned human resources director, bringing more than 15 years of expertise in recruitment, particularly for senior and executive roles spanning technology, high tech and blue-chip companies both in Ireland and internationally.<\/p> <p>  We all acknowledge that the role of director of cybersecurity must be on the executive level team and board where business decisions among the executive team will be discussed and agreed together when they are decided.  This is a new critical hire for the NCSC.  The seniority and accountability of this role cannot be understated.  The director of cybersecurity will be at the forefront of the centre to drive and influence right decisions on security, strategy, infrastructure, programmes, people, behaviours and so forth in developing a sustainable and scalable secure model.  The gravitas and accountability that come with this role define the calibre of candidate that we need.  This role demands the best-in-class hire.  We must provide every opportunity to the NCSC to hire the best, most qualified, proven candidate, and one who is capable of delivering on an international level.<\/p> <p>  If we are to hire for success, we must hire expertise in this field, most likely attracting from the public sector and, therefore the remuneration of this role must be competitive.  If we are to fill this role, we must apply the salary range and benchmarking of the private market sector.  We recognise that this is a time when the job market is extremely competitive.  We see a great deal of movement at senior level roles, particularly this year where there has been a huge lift in confidence in people moving.  With all this in mind, the benchmarking on current market data for this role of director of cybersecurity, or chief information officer, provides for a basic salary ranging between &euro;220,000 to &euro;290,000 per annum, plus benefits including bonus, long-term incentive plans and stock options combined with a benefits package ranging between &euro;150,00 to &euro;200,000 per annum.  It is worth mentioning, also, that we are seeing other varied and flexible benefits, for example, a one-time sign on bonus for executive hires ranging up to &euro;20,000<\/p> <p>.  Everything hinges on getting this hire right to ensure the sustainable and secure success of the National Cyber Security Centre.  We need to get the package right to ensure we hire the right calibre for this role.  Once we have the package defined, we must ensure the process is immediately defined and runs smoothly.  That will include branding the role, driving positive branding through social media, newspapers and other such channels, using our networks to reach out to and attract candidates of suitable calibre, ensuring the interview process is defined and clear from the outset to ensure that it runs smoothly and efficiently through a thoughtful process, bearing in mind that we are competing against a very fast external market in which candidates are hired and move quickly through processes.  I recommend that we meet this head-on to ensure we hire the best-in-class candidate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Bl&aacute;thnaid Carolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":901,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Carolan.

I am the chairperson of Cyber Ireland, the national cybersecurity cluster organisation.  Cyber Ireland brings together industry, academia and Government to represent the needs of the cybersecurity ecosystem in Ireland and to address key challenges for industry.  We aim to enhance the innovation, growth and competitiveness of the companies and organisations which are part of the cluster.  Today we have over 120 members nationwide, comprising 40 multinationals, 60 Irish SMEs and 12 of the leading academic institutes, with our partners in government including the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Our aim is to move forward Ireland's cybersecurity agenda and advocate for industry needs.  Now more than ever there is a need for a collaborative approach across industry, academia and Government to address Ireland's cybersecurity challenges.<br\/><br\/>Cybersecurity  is a rapidly growing industry internationally for which there are a number of opportunities and challenges.  It is estimated that cybersecurity spending will reach &euro;240 billion worldwide by 2023.  The annual global cost of cybercrime has exceeded &euro;1 trillion.  The number of unfilled cybersecurity<b><\/b>jobs is predicted to hit 3.2 million by 2022 and current unemployment levels are low.  There is increased global competition for talent and investment and there is increased cybercrime globally and in Ireland.  The economic impacts of cybercrime put our indigenous SME sector at risk and this has knock-on effects for our foreign direct investment, FDI, brand.  There are skill shortages globally and locally and there is low level collaborative security research and development between industry and academia.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has become a significant base of international technology and security companies.  Some six of the top ten software security companies are here.  There are over 40 multinationals with cybersecurity operations in Ireland and there are over 60 Irish cybersecurity companies and start-ups.  Over 6,000 people are working in our cybersecurity industry and 30,000 professionals have cybersecurity related skills.  We have a strong talent pool with a highly skilled and multilingual workforce.  We are a digital leader, attracting foreign direct investment and hosting much of Europe's data.  We have a dedicated workforce with talent development programmes.  Ireland is uniquely placed to benefit from increased global investment in cybersecurity.  It has an opportunity to position itself as a global leader for cybersecurity talent and innovation.<br\/><br\/>Cyber Ireland aims to facilitate the cybersecurity ecosystem to capitalise on this opportunity.  We have a strong focus on talent and skills to ensure a sustainable pipeline of cybersecurity talent.  Our Cyber Ireland skills report was published in February and its key findings clearly highlight the opportunity and challenges facing the industry.  Our finding tells us that: in Ireland, 62% of companies will hire in 2021; our cyber workforce is highly skilled; 48% of organisations have open or unfilled cybersecurity roles; 46% of cybersecurity teams are understaffed; 19% of cybersecurity teams require six months or more to fill a role; 42% of new hires are from outside of Ireland; and 27% of cybersecurity teams have difficulty in retaining female talent.<br\/><br\/>A sustained long-term strategy is needed to address these gaps and Cyber Ireland is focused on building a strong pipeline of talent from schools and universities to industry with our partners.  We have programmes in place that promote career opportunities in cyber to students through the cybersecurity academy for secondary schools and career talks in cyber summer camps that we have planned for June.  We welcome the skills initiatives that are focused on upskilling our existing workforce and attracting talent to cross train in cybersecurity.<br\/><br\/>We strongly believe we have an opportunity to be at the centre of a growing global cybersecurity market, support indigenous cybersecurity SMEs and start-ups, be a leader in cybersecurity policy and the response to ransomware, influence Europe's investment and prioritisation of cybersecurity, and create a national research and development centre along with the NCSC with a strong national security perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":904,"content":"<p>If the witnesses have prepared statements they might provide them to the clerk so that we can distribute them among members.

What should the two or three priorities be for Government in ensuring that more companies and State bodies move from being immature organisations to mature organisations?

There are a number of key principles that differ.  I would call it a defence mindset rather than a compliance mindset.  If one focuses on compliance one is just trying to achieve compliance but if one focuses on defence and protecting what is important to the organisation, then one is much more centred on the robustness and resilience of the organisation.  Board level involvement, top-down engagement from the top level of the organisation and a commitment to cyber resilience and cybersecurity are important to the business.  That involves communication upwards from stakeholders in the business to make the board aware of that and to be transparent with it on the exposure it faces, the maturity the organisation is at and the work programme it needs to undertake to achieve that resilience.  It is important to point out that it is a journey and not a destination.  There is no point at which an organisation is entirely resilient or mature.  It has to commit to the ongoing journey.<\/p> <p>  Back to the second speaker's point, organisations need to bring standards and measurement into play to assess matters.  There are standards so we do not need to reinvent the wheel.  There are standards like ISO\/IEC 27001, which is a well recognised standard.  It puts in place an information security management system and governance in an organisation.  It is objectively measured and assessed periodically by an auditor and then that builds a structure by which an organisation can then layer in the people, process and technology controls that make it mature and resilient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":907,"content":"<p>I would agree with what the first speaker said but I would add to it.  What I have seen across a lot of different sectors, including the defence sector in the United States for example, is that we have hundreds of thousands of companies that supply up the chain to the primary contractors.  Often when one goes into a defence industrial base company that is trying to baseline itself on a cyber standard, it might have two or three people, if that, who are responsible for this.  On top of the IT management work that they are already doing, they are having to report out on a standard.  Sometimes, if they have a little bit of a budget they will contract with a managed service provider or the like and that will put a process in place but I generally see that such a move might be a one-off and it does not then become a continuous practice.<\/p><p>There is a role for governments, even at the lowest levels.  Some of the best companies we have worked with on the smaller end have direct mandates from the top to spend a budget to baseline themselves and then some continuous improvement on the cyber standard.  The EU's NIS directive is in alliance with the cybersecurity framework, CFF, and ISO, the information security management framework and other control frameworks are informative references.  There are many good standards out there.<\/p><p> With larger companies, we get into big time governance issues.  In larger companies there are many different departments, including those deal with compliance, risk, information technology and operational technology.  They often talk to each other but when we get them on calls together, sometimes the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.  This is an issue.  They must also justify spend when it comes to fixing things.  They might have alarming gaps in a programme and have to take it upstairs but to take it upstairs, they must make a risk-based argument.<\/p><p> The governance structures are not always interested.  There has been much talk about cyber being central to governance in larger organisations but at times over here, to be frank, governance structures have been asleep at the wheel.  It takes events like this to shake them up and they do but then, sometimes, the hype cycle ends and they move on.  Education is a good element of what we are discussing and that also applies to governance structures as well.<\/p><p> There must be teeth behind this as well.  In larger sectors I see results if executive pay is sometimes tied to cyber.  My company has seen that.  It is a complicated challenge as there are resource-constrained companies on the smaller end.  Many of the ransomware hacks hit smaller organisations, which can be difficult, as it leads to a scramble.  They might not have had time or resources to back up things.  That is why they are such a juicy target for attackers.  In larger companies there are sprawl and antiquated practices.  Much cyber is still drawn on spreadsheets, which is a problem, as there must be central visibility for the practice of cyber inside a company.  Spreadsheets do not get the job done.  Many large service organisations deliver on the back of spreadsheets.  When Mr. George Wrenn and I founded our company, we created software that makes a central repository for the practice of cyber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":909,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly.

That creates much opportunity and brings some very critical roles to the country but it also creates competition within organisations operating here, both on a multinational and SME level.<\/p> <p>  The real opportunity or challenge is to create more awareness in the school systems and university sector to create graduates with the necessary skills to fill these roles.  There are also opportunities for cross-training of people who are working and may have an interest in cybersecurity to bolster the general need in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for an excellent question.  It is pertinent as we are seeing a very competitive market that has been going in this direction for quite a while.  I do not have direct experience of the NCSC but nonetheless in the nation and right across Europe we have seen much activity and movement in the area.  This is partly because of last year's pandemic, which we are still in the throes of, and we would normally see between 12,000 to 15,000 people moving to Ireland from other countries but that has not happened.  The market is that bit tighter as a result, which is certainly throwing up much more movement across companies.  It is becoming much more competitive and we are seeing many headquarters setting up in Dublin.  It is really competitive.<\/p> <p>  With regard to factors relating to retention, on a human resource element we are looking at hygiene and wellness factors and job satisfaction.  We are considering whether people are growing their skill sets and ensuring those skill sets and career opportunities are being made available.  That is really important to individuals.  There is also the question of pay and the additional benefits around it, which are important.

In general terms, the commercial sector has a slightly different mandate from the public sector and it comes back to the aspect of mindset.  In most cases, there is a very clear imperative.  We were shouting into the wind five years ago when we were trying to educate boards about the importance of cybersecurity and the need to do something about it.  The frequency and degree of crime and the resulting cost to organisations has ensured that data awareness now definitely exists.  Boards are bringing in businesses like ours to do cybermaturity assessments and assess organisations' readiness because they are interested in protecting shareholder value.  Customers vote with their feet if there are breaches.  Therefore, apart from the direct cost of an incident like a ransomware attack, or something like that, the tail cost is far more significant.  The clean-up costs, regulatory fines and related loss of customer confidence and revenue are huge factors.  This has ensured that boards are now intimately aware of the risks of cyber infrastructure and they are giving a mandate to their organisation to protect their revenue and customers.  The mindset now is a defensive one, namely to protect the business and shareholder value.  A clear mandate is coming from many boards to do that, and, therefore, there is a matching resource commitment from the top and a budget to do that.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that mandate is probably less clear in the public sector and in the Government.  There is more of a compliance mindset.  The National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, is also a regulatory authority for the European Union's network and information security, NIS, directive.  While it is a good framework and a step in the right direction, we must return to the fact that these are critical State services, such as health, telecommunications and power etc..  First and foremost, we need to secure those services.  If we do not do that, then the State and its people will suffer and so too will prosperity, because foreign direct investment, FDI, companies will vote with their feet.  That portable wealth and capital which exists in Ireland will simply move abroad.  If we are below par in cybersecurity, such wealth will move.  I refer to the State adopting a mindset which regards cybersecurity as critical to societal progress and prosperity and the protection of those aspects and not some notional compliance in respect of the EU concerning GDPR or NIS.  Do not get me wrong, compliance is important.  However, if we approach this issue from a mindset which views it as critical to our prosperity, services, economy and people, then that is a different mindset.  It is a mindset which leads to carrying out risk assessments and maturity capability assessments to protect against threats and putting programmes in place to secure the cyber infrastructure.  That mindset may not be as obvious in the Government and public sector, but it needs to be.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":914,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Larkin for that contribution.

Turning to the queries, the why aspect is complex.  The simplest answer though is that data are valuable.  Hospitals are being hit over here as well.  I refer to reputational concern.  The last time I was over in Ireland was in 2017.  I met with the Minister who then had responsibility for communications, and he told me that he wanted Ireland to be the primary cybersecurity centre for all of the EU.  Therefore, I can understand reputational concerns in that context, but everyone is getting hit.  This is a global problem and these criminal actors are inside states which often do not police their activities.  These are criminal organisations, but they punch a clock.  Their members show up in the morning and work.  They are professionals and are criminals.  They are very disciplined at what they do and they know what they are after, and that is data.  Health data are very valuable, and the organisations concerned are inclined to negotiate if their data are stolen.  Such a theft exposes private information and those are valuable data, and there are now even double ransom strategies.<\/p> <p>  The criminal organisations are growing in capability and the aspects of why this is happening are also connected to the technical level.  There are software vulnerabilities, remote desktop protocol vulnerabilities and all manner of things that hackers can do.  Hackers can log on to a website to look for Internet protocol, IP, addresses and do any number of things to breach systems and they will continue to do that.  We have a national ransomware task force over here which produced recommendations.  Ireland's firm stance on non-payment of the ransom is very impressive.  I state that because many of the companies here that are compromised get into quick negotiations and often publicly say they are not going to pay the ransom, when they have already paid it.

Taking up the general point made by the previous speaker, however, healthcare is attractive because the data is valuable.  In addition, both private and public systems are incredibly complex.  They have what are called a large attack surface area because of the complexity of the environment, the spread of the network and the range of different users of the system, including doctors, nurses, students and vendors as well.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, it is an incredibly complex environment, which means that it is relatively easy to target from an attack perspective.  Even robust health systems, because of that complexity, are also vulnerable.  Equally, there is the ability to monetise the situation.  I agree with the previous speaker in this regard as well, in that I think that it is the principled and correct decision to not pay a ransom.  The reality, however, is that more than 56% of organisations pay a ransom.  It is usually because they have no choice, but it could also be because organisations may not have the same resources that enable a state to go through a complex, lengthy and costly rebuild of its systems.  Most organisations, and especially those which are private, are therefore faced with a simple balance-sheet choice.<\/p><p>Do we spend tens of millions of euro rebuilding or do we spend &euro;1 million getting the keys to unlock the system and get back to core business?  It does not help to speculate, but I do not know that Ireland or Ireland's health system has been consciously targeted.  It is another health system that is vulnerable.  They have carried out a targeted attack that has been successful from their perspective.  It is very difficult for us, as a State.  The challenge is that today the health system could be attacked, tomorrow it could be the power grid, the day after that it could be the transportation grid.  <\/p><p> In respect of a national security mindset, we should be cognisant of the fact that traditionally, when we think about national security, we think about state actors carrying out targeted attacks from a foreign policy perspective to influence a government.  In this case we are also seeing criminals attacking from a financial crime perspective, with a similar attack profile and causing similar national damage as state actors, potentially.  The mindset must be that criminal cartels can in some respects cause as much consequential damage to a state as nation state actors carrying out deliberate foreign policy based attacks.  From a mindset perspective, it is necessary to take the position that, defensively, we must secure ourselves against the attacks of criminals almost as much as we need to be secure against nation state attacks, because either is of similar consequence and catastrophe to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":928,"content":"<p>In his opening statement, Mr. Larkin stated that politically and socially, we need to move to a national defence mindset, with our national cybersecurity as one of the key pillars of our defence.

The original point about the cyber, environmental and global pandemic being on the risk registers was that all of us, myself included, silently hoped that these events would never occur.  Therefore, we have been adopting the mindset of these events being a risk, but wondering of we should do anything about them.  These risks now have materialised and are materialising as we speak.  We must recognise that reality and change our mindset.<\/p> <p>  The national mindset and psyche is based on Ireland being a neutral country that is not in an alliance.  It is thought that we do not follow an aggressive foreign policy so therefore we do not need a large defence organisation or national security infrastructure or apparatus.  However, we do now, from a cybersecurity perspective.  We need to adopt that mindset.  It is not about projecting foreign policy or insidious foreign policy; it is about protecting the societal and economic benefits that we have.  Therefore, we must invest.  Historically, we have underinvested in national security.  <\/p> <p>  The threat is no longer a geographical one.  Any of these organisations, whether they are nation state or criminal organisations, can simply project themselves across the Internet at Ireland.  For example, Ireland is a member of the UN Security Council.  If we set out our policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or another issue on which are entitled to set out our policy, it is possible that perhaps not even a nation state but a militia group within a nation state, may object to that and inflict collateral damage on national security by simply objecting to it.  It is about recognising that reality and making the philosophical mindset shift towards the idea that we need to protect our national State, resources and sovereignty and then investing accordingly.  <\/p> <p>  The biggest issue is the shift in the societal and political mindset towards the idea that national security is important and we have something worth protecting.  Everything else flows from there.  We have a national risk assessment which is updated regularly.  We must look at that, because the risks were set out on that assessment.  We need commitment from Government.  It requires a whole-of-society commitment that is made collaboratively.  Government, industry and citizenry need to do their bit.  Once that mindset has been adopted and it is recognised that we must secure ourselves nationally, we need collaboration and alliances.  If an attacker is projecting themselves from a nation state in eastern Europe, Asia or wherever it is, we will not solve that problem from Ireland.  We will solve it through alliances with international governments, UN member states and international law enforcement, policing and intelligence.  We need to try to build that consensus.<\/p> <p>  We have an awful street credibility now because we are suffering a catastrophic attack on our national health system.  Looking at other countries that have suffered attacks, Estonia, for example, suffered a similar catastrophic attack against a wider set of its critical services in 2007.  It came back from it stronger.  It took the attack as a wake-up call.  Now, it is one of the leading actors in the area of international law on cybersecurity.  It built alliances, albeit typically with NATO member states, around protection.  In respect of resilience, it has developed a clear strategy around delivering digital government to ensure that it is secure in the face of an attack by a nation state or criminals..<\/p> <p>  We should heed the wake-up call.  We must make the shift in the mindset towards the need to ensure security and to do it right.  We must adopt a very coherent and well-resourced strategy to deliver it and we must stick at it.  We cannot just let this moment pass and move on with business as usual once the health system has recovered.  We need to heed the wake-up call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":930,"content":"<p>Currently there is an annual budget of &euro;5 million going into the national cybersecurity centre.

I agree with what has been said.  We have fairly conclusive proof, to the narrative that is out there, that we have insufficient capacity to deal with the situation we are in.

I am talking about the number of attacks and the number of criminals we believe are operating in this situation.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Reilly spoke about the Colonial Pipeline situation.  The big fear beyond even what has happened is the cyber to physical attack and us being wide open.  As brutal and heinous as the attack on the HSE was and, similarly, the Colonial Pipeline attack, they were both high profile and some of these gangs may have bitten off more than they can chew.  We all know there is a certain narrative that some of them might even be, as it were, semi-state operators, so there would be communications between states and these criminals, and maybe they have been told to rein themselves in.  The fact is there is a threat and it needs to be dealt with.

It is what we need from a point of view of protecting this State, as Mr. Larkin said, and then I have even heard a narrative in the past while that as we build that sort of capacity, we also need there to be an element of offensive capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#H00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":938,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked very good questions and I understand his concerns.

The gangs are going nowhere and ransomware continues to be developed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of semi-state actors, when I was on television I was repeatedly asked, in terms of the states they are acting out of, who is responsible for this.  It is something as a private citizen I am a little careful about but I think we all know they may be semi-state operators and, in that case, that means there is more will behind it.  When it gets to cyber to physical, you would want to be very careful about the political terms you speak in, obviously.  Cyber to physical keeps cyber professionals up at night.  There was a lot of great research around it done in 2010 and they were looking at attacks that propagate over the generator systems and the like.  Then, 2015 happened when we actually saw a grid go down in Ukraine.  Those types of attacks are truly scary because they hit the national infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  In the States, we have a unique situation that 85% of our public infrastructure is in private hands.  This is a very difficult situation to be in, largely because it is hard to impel some of those holders of that infrastructure to do the right things.  We have some regulations in place to force that but we are struggling and scrambling at the moment.  The Government has said all the right things after the Colonial Pipeline attack.  We are now evaluating whether pipeline security should be the responsibility of the Department of Transportation, and we have six individuals in oversight there, so there is an analogue to some of what Ireland might be dealing with at the NCSC.<\/p> <p>  My company makes software.  We benchmark organisations on cyber.  We work across a large set of organisations.  My perspective is we need standards.  Compliance is important but it is just one aspect of the overall approach to cyber.  I love the term \"risk assessment\" because it is the way forward.  You have to identify and prioritise, and risk assessments do that.  They also take probabilities into account.  That is why information sharing is so important here in the States because we have to have better ideas of what the probabilities are.  C-suites and boards will not invest if they cannot financialise the actual risk, but to financialise risk you have to have good data.  These are important things to understand in the practice of cyber.  Risk has to be understood.  Compliance and risk are related.  Talking about it more is getting the private and public partnerships going that will help to solve this long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":939,"content":"<p>At an operational level in an Irish context, we have a security operations centre.  Three years ago, ransomware for our clients, either the clients we have or inbound clients, would typically have been a once a week or once a fortnight event.  It is now a daily event, so we are dealing with ransomware incidents and outbreaks daily.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the previous speaker's point, it matches exactly with the profile of increase.  Why?  Because it is so easy to execute and it is so lucrative.  It is industrialised now from a cybercriminal's perspective.  There is a whole cybercriminal ecosystem.  When we talk about one group perpetrating this attack, actually it is not one group.  It is a whole layer of contractors and subcontractors who provide different ranges of services in perpetrating the attack and then liberating and washing the finances associated with it.<\/p> <p>  It is absolutely the case that, at an individual organisational level and at a national level, we all have to improve our cyberhygiene and beat the odds.  It is like the physical security in your home.  If you put a burglar alarm in, if you put gates and locks in, then typically the criminal passes by because it is more difficult to break into your house than your neighbour's.  Unfortunately, you are trying to secure yourself so that you are at the smaller end of the probability scale.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the previous speaker's point: it is all about risk and mitigating risk.  You can spend an infinite amount of money, resources and time delivering security and security technology, but the majority of it is inefficient if you are not deploying it against identified risk and mitigating that risk.<\/p> <p>  It comes back then to the broader agenda, where we need to lead as well, which is we have to change the game here.  Internationally, you have to make the organisations perpetrating this type of activity pariahs.  You have to make any nation states that are facilitating it or are ambivalent towards it pariahs and there have to be sanctions.  You have to enforce it.  At the moment at the UN there are still debates on whether cyber law is adequate and how we are going to deploy it and enforce it.  Because this is a global problem, however, while we can secure our critical services, our organisations etc., infinite defence in its own right is not a strategy.  The principle of defence, from my military days, is you defend and protect yourself long enough that you can launch a counter-attack.  That is the argument for defence.  If you are not in a position to launch a counterstrike against the people perpetrating this, then at some point they are going to get in.  You can defend repeatedly but at some point they are going to get in, so we need a global consensus to say this activity is a higher order of crime, particularly when it attacks critical national infrastructure or health systems.  It is not a financial crime; this is a higher order of crime.<\/p> <p>  Without being dramatic about it, there are adverse patient outcomes to what has happened in the health system leading to increased mortality.  This is not a financial crime.  This is a crime against society and a crime against people.  You have to look at it as that higher order of crime and we have to mobilise the United Nations and people like that to say this is unacceptable, the people perpetrating this are pariahs, and we have to go after them, their assets and their infrastructure like they were narcoterrorists or international criminals.

We consider this to be a relatively new area but, realistically, I am of an age that I remember movies such as \"War Games\" and \"Die Hard\", in which air traffic control systems were being taken down and nuclear missiles were going to be launched by ten- and 12-year-olds.  This topic is not that new even though it is now on our doorstep to the extent that we are unable to find out the number of Covid-19 cases per day or get updates on the level of vaccination.  We are not able to e-mail the HSE or the Department of Health in the way we normally would.  Technology is everything to us now, as demonstrated by how this meeting is being conducted.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that Estonia became a very digital society when it became an independent state in the early 1990s.  I do not know if it is an example of best practice in terms of combating cybercrime.  Are there any examples we can follow?

The market is the market but the idea that somebody is going to be paid more than the Taoiseach in this role is probably something that Irish society in general will find a little difficult to process initially.  However, the cost of tens of millions in lost revenue because of hijacking and the need to rebuild systems is much greater.  However, one individual is not going to change this situation.  Is there a roadmap?  We can hire somebody and spend three, four or six months getting the best person in the world and paying them &euro;250,000 a year or whatever it is, but what is the roadmap?  The situation changes all the time and these criminals only have to be lucky once.  We have brought our expert guests here today and I thank them for their statements.  Where do we as a country need to go from here?  It is obvious we need more people and training.  There are 60,000 people involved in dealing with cybercrime on a daily basis in Ireland, a figure that surprised me.  I am looking to our guests, as experts in the area, to tell me what we as a country need to do in the next month, the next six months and the next five years.

Estonia, as the Senator pointed out, had a compelling event and responded appropriately, as he has outlined.  Estonia has become a recognised centre of excellence.  It has adopted the strategy that it must survive particularly malevolent state action, and maintain society and the delivery of digital government in the event of a significant attack or influence.  Estonia is a base model.<\/p> <p>  The UK has probably come back to its national cybersecurity strategy two or three times but has made considerable progress this time around.  The cyber tsar it has put in is a recognisable individual, Mr. Ciaran Martin, who has added an awful lot of coherence.  He has added coherence in overall policy.  The UK has engaged in things such as active cyber defence whereby not only is it sitting in defence but it is targeting and taking down malicious domains and sites within its organisation in order to improve the cyber hygiene of government across the board.  The UK offers services that various public bodies would use, etc., and provides a significant level of investment.  There are lessons to be learned from how the UK has approached this matter the second or third time around.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate there may be reservations about other aspects of its society but Israel has done well from a cyber perspective and we should look at that.  Israel has imperatives around foreign policy and national security and it has, therefore, delivered a collaborative approach between the military and society.  I accept it is a militarised society and there is, therefore, an acceptance that cyber is an important pillar.  From a government perspective, Israel has led initiatives such as thinking outside the cyber box, etc.  There have been huge levels of innovation.<\/p><p>I was part of a buying mission when I was in the Defence Forces back in the late 1990s and I saw that level of collaboration between industry, users and military where literally some industry players had co-resident development ongoing with the military and the military was consuming their development of technology and then using that to export internationally.  In terms of a security imperative and a collaborative national approach, Israel is an example, appreciating all the other reservations about policy and everything else that is going on there.  Those are three examples we could look to build a collaboration, to create the cyber tsar and the leadership and from a national imperative to digital society to survive malign foreign intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":953,"content":"<p>On the roadmap, Mr. Larkin was talking about the best countries we can learn from.

The Colonial Pipeline attack expedited some things already under way in our government.  I would second all the things the previous speaker said with respect to best practices.  We still have challenges in the States.  We spend quite a bit more on cyber, something like &euro;20 billion per year.  We have a lot of very good standards and organisations which generate such standards.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, does a fine job and the federal government does baseline itself regularly.  That said, many challenges remain.<\/p> <p>  With respect to best practices, the committee could certainly look at the executive order just released from the White House.  It is pretty comprehensive.  The emphasis is really on information-sharing, to some extent, and on changing the acquisition contracts around companies that do business with the federal government.  That emphasis is really around information-sharing as well.  One of the big problems in cyber in the States is visibility into true risk.  Frequently there are these informational problems; companies are not reporting what is happening to them as there is an incentive not to.  However, fresh air is the best disinfectant.  When I was asked about this issue recently, I basically said it is hard to do risk assessment if one does not have complete data sets.  I hope to see from our government more emphasis on actually generating quality data sets with respect to risk because that will help governance structures make the improvements they need to make.  I re-emphasise that the executive order is a real fount for best practice.  I revisit it every day.  Newspapers call me every day to talk about it.  Its first recommendation is an interesting one; it suggests organisations should ensure logging practices are being done properly.  There is a set of maybe ten things that can be done across the board, that are not prohibitively expensive, that can be measured, around which metrics can be put, and can get the critical infrastructure or the essential services sector on the right path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":955,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly.

What type of form should it take?

Very quickly, first and foremost, I suggest a very clear commitment from Government to say national security, cybersecurity is important and therefore we must move nationally from immature to optimised.  A very clear statement around that would be good.  There is a national risk register which I think is conducted by the Department of Defence.  Taking the risk-based approach is looking at the risk register and then building strategic, tactical and operational mitigation of that risk with a commitment to it.  While we are talking about budget and spend, it is wasted unless it is mapped and used in terms of strategically-planned risk mitigation approaches.  Therefore I recommend a commitment from the Executive to say national cybersecurity is important and that we are really going to focus on improving it.  That feeds down to co-ordination at a central level.  What we do not want is turf wars and silos within Government so somewhere, maybe under the National Cyber Security Committee, NCSC, or under the Taoiseach, it needs to be co-ordinated from a national security perspective, with the cybersecurity pillar underneath that to drive it.  One then uses resources like the NCSC to provide leadership and governance, particularly of critical national infrastructure services, and one uses the standards and frameworks that are there, namely, those of ENISA, the International Organization for Standardization, ISO, the NIST, etc.<\/p> <p>  The genesis of the collaboration piece has already been started.  Cyber Ireland, which I should declare I am a board member of, along with Mr. Walsh and Dr. Byrne, is perhaps the genesis of this.  I say so because it has an economic agenda, which is about creating the ecosystem of industry, academia, research and Government, so it is further support for that.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland are already supporting that and it will, in some respects, create the talent pool, industry imperatives, etc.  Out of the national security plan, all of that is key but then we must build indigenous capability.  It is then about bringing all the resources of the State and their tasking up to date, by which I mean mandating police to police cybercrime and State security, and mandating the Defence Forces to build capability.  On that, I know, just colloquially that in some respect the Defence Forces have been restrained and contained in terms of the cyber role.  There is an opportunity there for every soldier to be a cyber-soldier, for argument's sake, from an innovation perspective, because they have a training mandate and then they would bring huge national resources in aid to the civil power to all the rest of the authorities on a crisis basis.  Thus it is about innovation, about taking the imperative from the top down to say this is really important, we need to solve it, we need to improve it and then all the strategy and resources flowing from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":960,"content":"<p>Dr. Byrne wants to come in on that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#K00900","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":961,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  To respond to the Deputy's question and build on Mr. Larkin's previous point, there is an opportunity here to build on public-private partnership and we have started that already with Cyber Ireland, the national cybersecurity cluster organisation which is aiming to bring industry, academia and Government together to address specific challenges for industry but also for national security as well.  It developed out of addressing the talent and skills shortage and a lot of the challenges have been clearly identified there already so I will not go through them again.  It is also important to say there is a huge amount of work already being done in growing home-grown cybersecurity talent in Ireland.  We have programmes there supported by Government, which are training up 5,000 professionals in cybersecurity skills all across different areas of the economy.<\/p><p>Fourteen new courses in cybersecurity were funded by the Government last year in our higher education sector.  A cybersecurity apprenticeship programme is producing entry-level graduates for the sector, and just last year an &euro;8 million project was funded under the Higher Education Authority human capital initiative, which aims to produce hundreds of new cybersecurity graduates.  That is being led out of Munster Technological University and four other academic institutes.  Cyber Women Ireland is addressing gender diversity, while other groups are looking at career promotion for secondary school students.  We are involved in the cybersecurity academy and have summer camps for internships.  A lot is being done but there is a lot more we can do.  In the UK, for example, there is the CyberFirst programme for secondary school students and the US has cyber ranges, or virtual training facilities, to provide cybersecurity training and education to secondary school students, third level students and citizens.<\/p><p> Another key point is that one of the reasons for developing Cyber Ireland was the current low level of collaborative research and development between industry and academia.  This is a severe challenge because there is currently a fragmented approach to cybersecurity research in Ireland, whereby academic and research entities are trying to address these urgent national scale cybersecurity challenges through a disconnected or small-scale response.  We need to look at developing a national cybersecurity research centre to address this challenge.  There would be potential to develop cybersecurity research solutions that could have sectoral applications for areas in which Ireland is already a leader, such as manufacturing, processing, the biopharmaceutical sector, industry 4.0 and so on.

I thank the participants for sharing their expertise and insight.  Everything we have heard this morning highlights the magnitude and complexity of the problem.  When it comes to cybersecurity it is quite obvious at this stage that Ireland left the front door and the back door open.  We are now reacting to fix the damage.  The damage is done and I have no doubt that our complacency will cost us dearly.  Dr. Byrne spoke about what has been done in recent years.  The HSE is the biggest organisation in the country and handles billions of euro of taxpayers' money.  Why was it so complacent and so outdated?  Why were its defences so weak?  The reason it was attacked is that it was obvious it was vulnerable and open to an attack.  From a technical perspective, why were the Department of Health and the HSE so vulnerable?<\/p> <p>  What would be involved in putting in place a defence mechanism?  We have heard we should be spending in the region of &euro;50 million, but if we had the budget and the personnel to put the infrastructure in place, what timescale would be involved in bringing it up to an acceptable standard?<\/p> <p>  Data are valuable and very personal to every individual.  There is an opportunity here for a double ransom, that is, one ransom from the HSE or the service provider and another from the individual.

Has that not left states and their agencies open not alone to ransom but also to legal actions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#L00400","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":966,"content":"<p>GDPR has not quite taken the same foothold in the States as it has in the EU.  Jurisdictionally it is not something a lot of American companies would concern themselves with and certainly not as regards localised health concerns.  We have a very distributed healthcare delivery system so it is quite different from Ireland's institution at the moment.  Some states have been frustrated by federal inaction on privacy regulations and have put their own standards into place, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, CCPA, and other states have followed suit.  As a means of enforcement, fine delivering bodies have taken a bit of a hold here in the States but I do not know that I have seen the impact across the healthcare delivery system in the States as of yet.  We have a very distributed, privatised system.<\/p> <p>  The Colonial Pipeline attack is a unique case study in how having public infrastructure in private hands goes quarter to quarter in terms of investment. A longer term capex is required with respect to mandating standards and the like and tying the performance around measuring risks and standards to actual numbers and analytics in order that organisations can make decisions about how they go about remediating.  If there is no way to measure it and if companies are just doing one-off risk assessments yearly, the data will be a year old when they revisit the issue and do the analytics, and in some respects they will be useless.<\/p> <p>  Our private sector has done brilliant things in cyber.  Like Israel, for example, we have many tech start-ups that do incredible things such as endpoint detection.  I have a partner company and some of our investment group has invested in Virsec, which does ring-0 malware detection and looks at memory protocols, effectively killing around 100% of attacks.  There are brilliant solutions in the private space but there has just not been enough co-operation to date between the public and private sectors.  That company was founded around the cybersecurity framework, which was a consortium of 3,000 industry experts in co-operation with NIST.  It is initiatives like that that drive more and more co-operation between the private and public sectors.  The public sector is great at certain things and the private sector is great at certain other things.  That co-operation is needed to get the synergies and efficiencies going forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":967,"content":"<p>What is the timescale?

As part of any systemic review we should be focusing on the lessons learned and then building those in as improved controls and governance structures to try to prevent such things.

The nature of the briefing is such that they are looking to assess whether this was, in our opinion, a nation state attack and what is the state of national cyber defence, etc.  I think that there is a heightened awareness.  I do not know that there is any imminent,<i>per se<\/i>, or immediate risk.  We have to look at it as a long game.  The long game is that we have to build strong, mature, optimised cybersecurity capability, to protect all the resources in the State.  If we do that, then we will continue to attract FDI and retain it.  That is why Cyber Ireland is so intrinsically important to this whole strategy.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the location of the NCSC, in some respects, it is as appropriate where it resides as anything else, provided that the national security governance and commitment is joined up.  That needs to come from centre of Government, somebody who can drive that strategy into all parts of Government organisation.<br\/><br\/>In terms of sanctions, blaming the victim is perhaps unhelpful here.  We do not blame homeowners when their houses are burgled.  We point to them where they could improve their security, etc.  Blaming the victim, in some respects, creates a perverse incentive for the ransomware attackers because, if we blame the victim, then there is an increased incentive not to disclose and pay.  I think we have got to move to a mindset of supporting and getting the victim to improve their security.  There will not be a healthcare professional working in the health system who will not be traumatised by what has happened, between Covid-19 and ransomware.  I think we will get goodwill.  A compelling event like what has happened - disastrous as it is &ndash; is quite often, if used positively, a good spur to drive improvement and to gain buy-in to improvement.  If it is a stick-only approach, one will achieve very little progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I call Ms Carolan to be followed by Mr. Walsh and Dr. Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#M01000","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":980,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for an excellent question.

The Senator&rsquo;s question on a security awareness programme on a national level is an incredibly important point.  It is being used throughout Europe and internationally to raise awareness of cybersecurity.  I think it is important that we tell a story of the impact of cybersecurity on society and start a national conversation around cybersecurity.  That needs to be funded appropriately.  The NCSC has a national cybersecurity awareness programme that runs in October, in line with the European cybersecurity month, which is run by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA.<\/p> <p>  There is also a role for Ireland to play within Europe for cybersecurity.  Just this morning, there was a European Commission workshop on the establishment of the European cybersecurity competency centre, which is looking at supporting indigenous European small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, to develop, to innovate, to grow and to compete internationally, while also building Europe&rsquo;s cybersecurity posture and strategies.  There will be national cybersecurity co-ordination centres set up as part of this European competency centre, so Ireland would be setting up one of these.  That needs to be set up within six months of the European competency centre, which is being set up in Bucharest in the coming months.  There is a decision there on whether Ireland wants to lead the way in setting up its national co-ordination centre or whether it wants to wait and see what other organisations and member states are doing.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the junior certificate programme, there is already work being done by the NCSC in developing a junior cycle programme in cybersecurity.  I think it is piloting that next September for transition year students.   Definitely, as part of the leaving certificate curriculum, it would be important that the computer science module would have a cybersecurity element to it.<\/p><p>The apprenticeship programme is providing entry-level graduates to the sector.

I thought that was very alarming.  It gives some context to where everything is at.  This is a form of attack.  Our country has been under attack for the last week and a half.  It is a new form of warfare, where a country is laid siege to by another entity.  I want to ask a question that has not come up so far.  It concerns me that it is going to take us, as a nation, five to ten years to get to full capacity to fight back against cyberattacks.  In that time, things will have shifted hugely.  We may get to the finish point and yet find that the whole world has changed in that interim period.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that struck me was that this form of attack is, as I said, a form of warfare, but we are a neutral country, militarily.  However, when it comes to cyberattacks, this is a global problem.  I put the following question to the panel.  Do we really need to go so far to create our own competency to fight cybercrime, knowing that other countries spend far more than us and knowing that their systems are far more advanced than ours?  Is this something where we should cede some of our cyberneutrality and ask another country or entity that has a greater capacity to fight this off to support us in that regard?<\/p> <p>  This happens very often in the military sense, where countries build alliances.  Ireland is small.  Our capacity will take five to ten years to build.  Our neighbours in Britain spend ten times more than us per head of population fighting cybercrime.  I would like to ask Mr. Larkin whether there a logic and any precedent in terms of other countries leading in respect of the fight back in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#N00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I might let Mr. Larkin go first and then Mr. O'Reilly can conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#N00600","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":989,"content":"<p>Could there be just one contributor?

We are not going to fight this on our own, but we need indigenous capability, first and foremost.  I do not think we could depend on others because alliances will change.  We need indigenous capability.  However, in order to be successful, we will have to partner and have alliances.  Those alliances may not necessarily compromise our neutrality.  It is collaboration that will happen between police forces, defence agencies, intelligence agencies, peer-to-peer, the National Cyber Security Centre, industry and academia.<\/p> <p>  In terms of staying current and the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the investment we are making, it is a very agile approach.  Something like the National Cyber Research Centre and the drawing together of the research and development strands is absolutely critical to leading and to staying current.

Once they are nations that have a capacity to help support us and have a system superior to ours, we should lean on them as much as we can.<\/p> <p>  Some 14 months ago, before being elected to the D&aacute;il, I was a primary school teacher.  In every primary school, there is a vertical axis in the principal&rsquo;s office.  There is a computer that is networked all the way up to the Department.  It would hold a lot of sensitive data.  However, if one goes into all the classrooms, one could have a Windows 95 or Windows 97 laptop, which is linked back to the principal&rsquo;s office.  This would be typical of every school in Ireland.  There is a real chink in the armour there.  If one were to get into a teacher&rsquo;s laptop at any time, there would be everything from tests to assessment data.  There could also be very sensitive information.  That is just in education.  It is probably replicated in the small two or three garda Garda stations in rural Ireland or in the local health centre run by the HSE.  We probably have fairly robust systems in the central vertical axis of organisations, but it is far weaker as one moves out.   I would like to ask Mr. Larkin whether the chink in the armour is those outposts of State organisations and Government agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#N01200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1621897200,"counter":995,"content":"<p>I do not think so.  The chink is perhaps everywhere.  The Deputy is right that we need an approach that secures the citadel, the critical parts of the network and where the data resides.  Realistically, and without being alarmist, the reality is that in every part of infrastructure, power, utilities, etc., one will find laptops and operational technology, OT, devices that exist that are perhaps are not appropriately controlled or secured.  That relentless risk assessment and information security management is trying to identify those points on highly secure, highly critical networks as much as less-secure peripheral networks, to find those vulnerability points and those weaknesses and either secure or remove them.  Our experience would be that at the centre of some of the most sensitive and eye-rollingly scary environments, we will find the same weaknesses that the Deputy just outlined.  There will be relatively insecure or uncontrolled devices creeping onto those networks, producing a vulnerable point by which those networks can be compromised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021052500002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1621897200,"counter":996,"content":"<p>When ransoms were paid, did the attacks stop?

If they are operating from environments where there is ambivalence towards them, perhaps they have broken a norm.  In general terms, if they were attacking a non-aligned, more neutral state, with whom perhaps the state in which they operate might not necessarily have an axe to grind, it may be that they are taking the heat off themselves.
