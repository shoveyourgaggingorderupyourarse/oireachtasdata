Social media content moderators should be treated by an employer in the same way as any other worker potentially exposed to hazards. The employer must ensure that appropriate training is provided and must carry out a robust risk assessment with a particular focus on potential hazards for the worker. Proper risk assessment, along with mitigation measures, is the foundation for all workplace health and safety. The Health and Safety Authority has an extensive range of advisory and guidance material available to employers to assist them in identifying and managing specific workplace hazards and risks. In addition, any content moderator concerned for their health and safety can contact the Workplace Contact Unit of the Health and Safety Authority in confidence at www.hsa.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Our suite of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on a contract of service basis.

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licensed bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licensed public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.<\/p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6 months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  <\/p>  <p>  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. The NTA, following consultation with operators, has recently finalised a review of the scheme and as a result some changes to services are expected to be implemented this month.<\/p>  <p>  As is the case in many other sectors of the economy, despite these Government supports, Covid-19 has resulted in significant financial pressures for public transport operators.  As you will be aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway business operates on a commercial basis in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licensed bus market.  Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020.  This was a commercial decision by the company.  The decision affects four routes:  the Dublin\/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020): and services on the Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Galway routes.  <\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement public service obligation (PSO) service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services.<\/p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500065#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":236,"content":"<p>Question No. 91 answered with Question No. 90.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500065#WRF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[27493\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500065#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he considers the driver theory test centres to be essential services; and when the driver theory test centres will reopen.","asker":"1628","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>The Driver Theory Test is considered a non-essential service by Government, and remains closed for now.

The incentive provides a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. In the case of a purchase of a new home, the property must be a &quot;qualifying residence&quot; sold by a &quot;qualifying contractor&quot;.<\/p><p>Section 477C(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA)  defines a qualifying residence as a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling.  Renovation or refurbishment of old houses to either upgrade or reinstate them for habitation does not qualify for HTB.<\/p><p>For a vendor to become part of the HTB process, they must first apply to Revenue to register as a qualifying contractor. The requirements that must be satisfied by the contractor are as outlined in section 477C(2) TCA. These include that the contractor must be tax compliant and either a zero rated or 20% rated contractor for the purposes of Relevant Contract Tax (RCT). Revenue Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-46 provides further details.<\/p><p>Qualifying contractors are required to verify information provided by the applicant in the HTB process. Where the conditions of the HTB are satisfied and a HTB refund is available, the HTB refund is paid to the qualifying contractor to be offset against the purchase price of the property.<\/p><p>Revenue advise that in order to determine if the properties in question satisfy the definition of a qualifying residence, consideration would have to be given to whether the construction of the properties started before the introduction of the HTB scheme; when the properties were completed, and whether the same contractor started and finished the property. Revenue Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-46 outlines further guidance on what would be considered a &ldquo;new&rdquo; house. Examples 5, 6 and 7 may be particularly relevant as they outline scenarios where a contractor may have started the construction of the property before the introduction of the HTB scheme. Revenue further advise that to determine if the HTB scheme would be available for the properties at Loreto Wood, Cavan, the full facts and circumstances would need to be considered to determine if the HTB conditions are satisfied.<\/p><p>Details may be sent to Revenue's HTB team to Personal Division at <i>PAYE Services, PO Box 327, PAYE Mail Centre, Churchfield, Cork.<\/i>If the Deputy requires any

obtained.<\/p><p>The purpose of deterrence strategies for tax administrations is to dissuade taxpayers from non-compliant behaviour. I am advised by Revenue that taxpayer behaviour determines the nature and extent of its compliance interventions. Revenue's interventions range from non-audit compliance interventions such as assurance checks, aspect queries and profile interviews to audit or investigations. It undertakes criminal investigations where cases of serious tax and duty evasion and fraud are discovered, seeking to apply the full legal sanctions available that reflect the seriousness of the evasion involved. These activities all form part of Revenue&rsquo;s deterrence strategies.<\/p><p>Overall, the international research literature suggests that deterrence is an important driver for taxpayer behaviour but works differently in different contexts and may best be used as a tool for supporting existing norms in favour of compliance. Revenue's published behavioural insights research confirms the same applies in Ireland and that deterrence strategies (e.g. highlighting possible sanctions) dissuade taxpayers from non-compliant behaviour.<\/p><p>Furthermore, Revenue's regular, large-scale customer surveys seek views of taxpayers on the influence of various sanctions on their compliance behaviour. Surveys of small to medium sized enterprises and chargeable persons (self-employed individuals) confirm that, while most taxpayers view tax compliance as a matter of civic responsibility, the sanctions applied by Revenue in line with the overall legislative framework are important factors in deterring non-compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":463,"content":"<p>Question No. 174 answered with Question No. 173.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Agreements","counter":464,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":465,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[27488\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the ratification by Ireland of the Council Decisions (EU, Euratom) 2020\/2053 of 14 December 2020 on the system of own resources of the European Union and repealing Decision 2014\/335\/EU, Euratom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":466,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, EU leaders reached agreement in July 2020 on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and Next Generation EU (NGEU) package totalling &euro;1.82 trillion.

Last year in Finance Act 2020 I introduced enhanced CFC (Controlled Foreign Company) Rules to apply to businesses in jurisdictions included in the EU list of harmful tax jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, like most countries, has introduced support schemes and attached various conditions to the eligibility for COVID-19 supports. Across a range of Government Departments a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic has been put in place, including the following operated by the Revenue Commissioners:- COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and debt warehousing of tax liabilities. I am not aware whether any companies receiving public supports in Ireland are registered in jurisdictions that are included on the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme was introduced in Finance Act 2020 to support businesses significantly affected by restrictions introduced to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is available to eligible businesses who carry on a business activity that is impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. The business must have been required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises. Generally, this refers to COVID-19 restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 as explained in the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with COVID-19. Certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS is available to eligible businesses that carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises, including companies, sole-traders or self-employed individuals, and partnerships.<\/p>  <p>  To be eligible:<\/p>  <p>-  the profits of the trade or trading activities of the business must be chargeable to Irish tax under Case I of Schedule D,<\/p>  <p>-  the business premises must be located wholly within a geographical region for which Irish Government COVID-19 restrictions are in operation, and<\/p>  <p>-  businesses must possess valid tax clearance to enter the CRSS and continue to maintain tax clearance for the duration of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>Further details are available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/self-assessment-and-self-employment\/crss\/qualifying-criteria-for-eligible-businesses.aspx.<\/p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme was legislated for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020. The objective of the TWSS was to keep an employee on his or her employer&rsquo;s payroll and to provide support to keep the employee&rsquo;s income at a level close to his or her normal average wage. The TWSS was only available to employers registered in Ireland whose business activities were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and applied as regards employees who were on the employer's Irish payroll at 29 February 2020. The scheme applies to businesses (companies, partnerships, individuals) resident for tax purposes in the State and also to non-resident companies that carry on a trade in the State through an Irish branch.<\/p>  <p>  A non-resident company that carries on a trade in the State through an Irish branch is chargeable to Irish corporation tax on trading profits and other income relating to the Irish branch. I am advised by Revenue that aggregate information in relation to wage subsidy payments made to this category of employer &ndash; companies that are not tax resident in the State but are trading here through an Irish branch &ndash; is not available. However, in accordance with section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, the names and addresses of all employers to whom a temporary wage subsidy has been paid by Revenue is published on its website and available at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/employing-people\/twss\/list-of-employers\/index.aspx.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the &ldquo;July Stimulus&rdquo; announced on 23 July last, the Government introduced the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). The EWSS was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 which was signed into law on 1 August 2020. It replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme from 1 September 2020. The EWSS delivers an enterprise support to employers based on business eligibility delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis.<\/p>  <p>  As is the case with the TWSS, the EWSS applies to businesses (companies, partnerships, individuals) resident for tax purposes in the State and also to non-resident companies that carry on a trade in the State through an Irish branch. No aggregate information in relation to companies that are not tax resident in the State but are trading here through an Irish branch is available in relation to the EWSS. However, the names and addresses of all employers to whom the EWSS has been paid by Revenue is periodically published on its website at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/employing-people\/ewss\/list-of-employers-who-received-payments-under-the-ewss.aspx. Additionally, and unlike the TWSS, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the debt warehousing scheme provides for reduced interest on certain tax liabilities which businesses were unable to pay as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, namely VAT, PAYE (Employer), Income Tax and excess TWSS. These supports are only available to Irish taxpayers. For all taxes in the scheme, a taxpayer must continue to file all returns and pay its other tax liabilities. The condition for eligibility for warehousing VAT, PAYE (Employer) and excess TWSS debts is that the business must have been adversely affected by restrictions to combat the spread of Covid-19, such that it cannot pay its liabilities. The condition for eligibility for warehousing Income Tax liabilities is that the individual&rsquo;s income for 2020 must have been reduced by at least 25% compared to his\/her income for 2019, as a result of the impact on his\/her income of the Covid-19 restrictions and he or she is therefore unable to pay those liabilities. Further details on the warehousing of tax debts are available from the Revenue website at:<\/p>  <p>www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/communications\/covid19\/filing-and-paying.aspx.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware that the Department for Enterprise, Trade, and Employment provides other supports including the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme (CCGS) which makes up to &euro;2 billion in lending available for Irish businesses and is the largest guarantee scheme in the history of the State. Its function is to add certainty to businesses that funding is available for working capital and investment purposes. Loans of up to &euro;1 million are available for up to five and a half years at reduced interest rates. Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require collateral or personal guarantees. The Scheme is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (including primary producers) and will run until 31 December 2021 in accordance with the European Commission's State Aid Temporary Framework implemented in response to COVID-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[27490\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the end date for the employment wage subsidy scheme is set.","asker":"1514","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":472,"content":"<p>To answer the Deputy's question, no end date for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has been set as yet. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the EWSS is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.1 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;521 million have been granted to 49,200 employers in respect of almost 563,800 workers.<\/p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware, it was decided by Government that the scheme would be extended until the end of June 2021. Similarly, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) was also extended to end June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Motions seeking the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the extension of the CRSS and the EWSS to 30 June 2021 took place on Thursday 22 April, during which I reaffirmed the Government's commitment that there would be no immediate end to the economic supports at the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.<\/p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit. For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer'&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement. The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders. Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation. Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender. Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers' best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.<\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.<\/p>  <p>  The tax system in Ireland does not treat cohabiting couples the same as married couples or civil partners. Tax legislation provides that cohabiting couples are assessed as single individuals and each cohabiting partner will be entitled to the basic personal tax credit of &euro;1,650.<\/p>  <p>  There are no tax credits or reliefs available to a surviving cohabitant on or following the bereavement of a partner. However, a surviving cohabitant may be entitled to claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit (currently &euro;1,650) if:<\/p>  <p>1. a qualifying child resides with her or him for the whole or greater part of a year of assessment; and<\/p>  <p>2.  she or he is not jointly assessed for tax as a married person or civil partner, living with her or his spouse or civil partner, or cohabiting with a partner.<\/p>  <p>  A qualifying child is:<\/p>  <p>-  a child who was born in the tax year;<\/p>  <p>-  a child who was under the age of 18 at the start of the tax year;<\/p>  <p>-  a child who was over the age of 18 at the start of the tax year if she or he is either in full-time education or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining herself or himself; or<\/p>  <p>-  an individual who is over the age of 21 if she or he is permanently incapacitated, having become permanently incapacitated before reaching the age of 21 or whilst in full-time education.<\/p>  <p>Further information on the Single Person Child Carer Credit can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website, available here.<\/p>  <p>  Another tax credit available to co-habiting couples in certain circumstances is the Incapacitated Child Tax Credit, which is currently &euro;3,300. The requirement for relief for this tax credit is that a claimant has custody of and maintains an incapacitated child. The claimant is entitled to the same tax credit in respect of the child as if the child were a child of the claimant. The credit can be claimed by a person in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining herself or himself and had become so before reaching 21 years of age or finishing full-time education. More information about this credit is available on Revenue's website here.<\/p>  <p>  A further measure of tax relief is also available to cohabitants where a cohabiting relationship ends. To qualify for the particular relief the partners must be &ldquo;qualified cohabitants&rdquo;. The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants (CPCROC) Act 2010 defines qualified cohabitants as persons who have been in a committed and loving relationship with another person for a minimum period of 5 years (2 years where they are parents of one or more dependent children), whose relationship has ended due to death or separation and neither of whom was married to and living with another person in 4 of the 5 years immediately before the end of the relationship.<\/p>  <p>  If the relationship ends, and one partner successfully applies for financial redress under section 173 CPCROC Act 2010, tax relief may be available in respect of payments made for the support of a former dependent partner. Relief may only be claimed in respect of legally enforceable arrangements made under section 175 CPCROC Act 2010.  The tax treatment is broadly similar to that of separated spouses or former civil partners.<\/p>  <p>  A claim for tax relief for maintenance payments to a former cohabitant is subject to the following conditions:<\/p>  <p>-  the individual making the payments (payer) is not entitled to deduct or retain out of the payment any amount representing income tax on the payment;<\/p>  <p>-  the payer is allowed, in computing her or his total income, a deduction for maintenance payments made in the year of assessment for the benefit of the qualified cohabitant;<\/p>  <p>-  the recipient is taxable under Case IV, Schedule D, in respect of such maintenance payments received; and<\/p>  <p>-  both individuals are taxed as single persons.<\/p>  <p>  Tax relief for maintenance payments will cease if the qualified cohabitant:<\/p>  <p>-  marries or re-marries,<\/p>  <p>-  enters into a recognised foreign marriage,<\/p>  <p>-  enters into a civil partnership (applies on or before 15 November 2015 only), or<\/p>  <p>-  enters into a foreign partnership, which is recognised in Ireland by virtue of section 5 CPCROC Act 2010 (applies on or before 15 May 2016 only).<\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT), the relationship between the person who provides a gift or inheritance and the person who receives the gift or inheritance determines the lifetime tax-free threshold (the Group Threshold) below which gift and inheritance tax does not arise. Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group Threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of her or his relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess benefit. In the case of a cohabitant who is not related to the disponer, the relevant tax-free threshold is the Group C threshold, which is currently &euro;16,250.<\/p>  <p>  Cohabiting individuals can avail of the &lsquo;dwelling house exemption&rsquo; to bequeath their principal private residence, generally the most substantial asset owned by an individual, free from inheritance tax. This relief is available to people who share a home and meet the conditions of the relief and it is not dependent on the relationship between them. Further details are available at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/gains-gifts-and-inheritance\/cat-exemptions\/exemption-for-dwelling-house\/index.aspx.<\/p>  <p>  Section 88A Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 exempts transfers of property made under court order between qualified cohabitants within the meaning of Part 15 of the CPCROC Act 2010. This is a redress scheme which provides protection in law for long-term cohabiting couples and provides safeguards for an economically dependent cohabitant where a relationship has ended, or on death.  <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[27576\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a bank (details supplied) held a banking licence prior to 2008; and if so, the date on which a licence was granted to the bank by the Central Bank.","asker":"1496","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the main activity of IIB Homeloans Ltd. was the assessment, underwriting and management of residential mortgage backed credit facilities to retail customers.<\/p>  <p>-  This entity was regulated as a multi-agency intermediary under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, from 1 July 2001 until 7 June 2005.<\/p>  <p>-  It was regulated as a retail credit firm from 1 June 2008 until 24 October 2008, when it changed its name to KBC Mortgage Bank and was authorised as credit institution, i.e. a licensed bank, under Section 9 of the Central Bank Act 1971. <\/p>  <p>-  In February 2009, KBC Mortgage Bank transferred its business to KBC Bank Ireland plc.<\/p>  <p>  For the time period between the 7 June 2005 (when the Investment Intermediaries Act authorisation status was revoked - (revocations can occur for a number of reasons including voluntarily revocations due to firms no longer carrying out that specific regulated activity or transferring the activity to another entity) - and 1 June 2008 (when authorisation as retail credit firm came into effect), IIB Homeloans did not require an authorisation from the Central Bank of Ireland.

The key components of the fiscal rules are a 3 per cent of GDP threshold for the headline deficit, a 60 per cent debt-to-GDP threshold, a balanced budget after adjusting for the economic cycle (measured by the structural balance) and the expenditure benchmark. The EU's fiscal rules do, therefore, place constraints on Member States' borrowing, both in a single year, through the deficit-limits, and over multiple years, through the debt-rule. <\/p><p>Last year, Ireland recorded a general government deficit of 5.0 per cent of GDP and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 59.5 per cent. However, as the Deputy will be aware, the normal operation of the fiscal rules has been suspended since March 2020, when the so-called <i>General Escape Clause<\/i>of the SGP was activated. This clause allows Member States to depart from the regular budgetary requirements under the Pact in order to allow them to take all necessary measures to effectively address the pandemic, sustain the economy and support the ensuing recovery. The clause is in place for 2021 and the European Commission are shortly expected to give their view on whether it should be extended to 2022.<\/p><p>It is also important to recognise that under the normal operation of the SGP, the rules themselves do not limit the level of government expenditure. Additional public investment is always possible if it is matched by revenue-raising measures and\/or offsetting expenditure adjustments elsewhere. In addition, to avoid penalising spikes in government investment, the framework allows investment to be smoothed over a four year period. This means that only one quarter of the increase in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) will impact on compliance under the expenditure benchmark in that year.  In this respect, it is important to bear in mind that Ireland has remained compliant with the fiscal rules while housing investment has more than doubled since 2016. Budget 2021 allocated a record level of funding to housing, reflecting the key priority Government is giving to this issue.  At &euro;3.1 billion, this is 41 per cent above the previous peak in 2008.<\/p><p>Looking forward to the post-pandemic period, we must recognise that there was evidence of an investment gap across Europe before the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. Prior to the pandemic, public investment remained below pre-financial crisis levels in several Member States. The role of the EU fiscal rules in creating or tackling this investment gap is a complex question but one which I believe we must consider at both a national and European level.<\/p><p>Early last year, the European Commission presented a formal review of the legislation underpinning the SGP, including the launch of a public consultation on the operation of the fiscal rules. Discussions around this review were paused to allow Member States to address the immediate challenges of the pandemic. The Commission have stated their desire to relaunch the public debate on the fiscal framework once the post-pandemic economic recovery takes hold. I believe addressing the investment gap in Europe should be a key part of discussions on the future of the framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500071#WRM04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500072#WRN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[27621\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500072#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will extend the help-to-buy scheme to include previous homeowners whose relationship or marriage has broken down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 requires that applicants for the Help to Buy Scheme (HTB) must be first-time buyers.

Therefore, the following information relates to investment in Irish property in general.<\/p>  <p>  Companies<\/p>  <p>  The rental profits of an Irish resident company are chargeable to corporation tax at the higher 25% rate.  I am advised by Revenue that due to the interaction of reliefs and credits after the calculation of gross tax by companies, it is not possible to separately identify the amount of net corporation tax paid on rental income by these companies.  However, information in respect of net rental income for various years is published by Revenue on the &ldquo;Summary of Corporation Tax returns&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish rental profits of a non-resident company are chargeable to income tax at the standard rate (currently 20%). As with Irish resident companies, due to the interaction with reliefs and credits, it is not possible to identify the net income tax paid on rental income by non-resident companies. Statistical information with respect to income tax paid by non-resident companies, who file an income tax return (Form 1) rather than a corporation tax return (Form CT1), is not currently available.<\/p>  <p>  Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2013 introduced the regime for the operation of REITs in Ireland and the rules relating to REITs are set out in Part 25A, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors to direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. This double layer of taxation is removed by providing that REITs are not subject to corporation tax on their rental profits or on any gains that arise from the disposal of rental properties, and requiring that REITs must distribute at least 85% of their profits annually for taxation at the level of the investor. Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) provisions at a rate of 25% (20% prior to 1 January 2020) apply to distributions by REITs.<\/p>  <p>  DWT does not apply on distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as a pension or a charity as they are more generally exempt from tax at the entity level, and nor will it apply to situations where the Parent \/ Subsidiary Directive applies.  Investors can make a claim for a repayment of dividend withholding tax if they are entitled to a lower rate of withholding tax under a double tax agreement. <\/p>  <p>  As REITs are not subject to corporation tax on their Irish property profits or gains, there is no obligation to report these amounts to Revenue. Revenue has also confirmed that, due to the small number of REITs involved and the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer information, they cannot provide specific information in relation to the rental income associated with these entities, including specific detail relating to residential investment.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs)<\/p>  <p>  The rules relating to IREFs are set out in Chapter 1B of Part 27, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and were introduced by Finance Act 2016. An IREF is an investment fund, or a sub-fund, which derives 25% or more of its market value from Irish real estate.  <\/p>  <p>  As an investment undertaking, the profits or gains of the IREF are not taxed within the fund, but instead are subject to tax in the hands of the investors, its unit holders. IREFs are subject to a 20% IREF withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors on the occurrence of an IREF taxable event. An IREF taxable event can broadly be defined as any way in which the value of the profits of the IREF are passed to the unit holder, e.g. by way of a relevant payment (which is akin to receiving a dividend). Irish resident individuals\/corporates are subject to investment undertakings tax. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500072#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500072#WRN01800"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[27702\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500072#WRN01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) is not eligible for the Covid restrictions support scheme; the options available to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal.

In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p><p>In order to allow for the PMC assessments and appeals to recommence I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation which, following the approval of the Finance Act 2020, allowed assessments to recommence.<\/p><p>Following approval of the Finance Act 2020, a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities and the criteria for qualification for the Scheme, will be conducted this year.

Where a person or couple have a PAYE source of income only, Revenue reduces their annual tax credits and rate band to take account of any taxable DSP payments, thereby ensuring the tax due is automatically collected through the payroll system. This normally means that the tax due on any taxable DSP payment is collected by reducing the tax credits on other income or private pensions.

This is because farming, which is defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, requires that the occupation of farmland and agricultural contracting does not involve the occupation of farmland. The measure is specifically targeted at the farming sector to address the particular problems faced by family farms. <\/p>  <p>  The reply also outlines that my officials met with agricultural contractor representatives in December 2019 and advised them that my Department was intending to schedule a review of the scheme (and related aspects) in the context of a wider report on agri-tax reliefs and the Climate Action Plan approved by Government in June 2019.  The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the intervening period has influenced the timing of such a review which has yet to take place.

Such sales of alcohol products are referred to as &ldquo;distance sales&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  Distance sales of alcohol products from one EU Member State to a consumer in another Member State are subject to VAT in the Member State of destination of the supply, which would be Ireland if the consumer is based in this State.  In all such cases, the supplier of those goods is required to  register in the State and account for VAT.<\/p>  <p>  Specific requirements apply in relation to excise duty on the  distance sales of alcohol products from another EU state to a private individual in Ireland.  The vendor in the Member State of dispatch must appoint a tax representative in Ireland  who must be approved by Revenue.  The tax representative must provide a guarantee for the excise duty prior to the dispatch of the alcohol products and must pay the excise duty on arrival of the products at the designated address in Ireland.  Failing this, liability for payment ultimately rests with the person to whom the products have been delivered in the Member State of destination.  <\/p>  <p>  Alcohol products ordered by persons, both business and private consumers, from suppliers established outside the EU are subject to customs duty, VAT and excise duty which are normally payable prior to the release of the goods into free circulation in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue inform me that they are very aware of the growth in business of consumer internet sales and of the risks this presents, both to tax revenues and domestic business, and that they are working continuously to strengthen their controls in this area. Revenue uses a range of measures to monitor internet retail activity directed at customers in Ireland. Revenue&rsquo;s work at ports, airports and postal depots to ensure compliance is supported by equipment and resources such as scanners and x-ray machines and these are reviewed regularly in light of technological developments and operational effectiveness.

This is a sector that has seen exponential global growth in the past decade, which has not been reflected in the industry growth here in Ireland, and there are potential synergies with our established film and animation sectors to support quality employment in creative and digital arts in Ireland. The intention is to publish legislation to introduce this new credit as part of the 2021 Finance Bill process. It is important to note however, that European Commission State aid approval will be required prior to the introduction of the tax credit. Therefore it is expected that the Finance Bill 2021 legislation will be introduced subject to a commencement order, pending completion of the State aid approval process.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the provision for quality employment within Section 481, Finance Act 2018 amended the section 481 certification process to provide that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, after considering an application and applying a set of tests, may issue a Cultural certificate to a producer company stating that a film is qualifying film for the purpose of the credit. One of these tests relates to employment on the qualifying film. Applicants must complete an &ldquo;Undertaking in respect of quality employment&rdquo;. This undertaking commits applicants to compliance with all relevant employment legislation in relation to the film being certified.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that Revenue carries out a comprehensive programme of compliance operations each year across a broad range of economic sectors, including the film industry. Many of the operations are carried out on a multi-agency basis, which can include officials from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the Workplace Relations Commission. The primary role of these joint investigation units, JIUs, is to detect non-compliance with tax and duty obligations, which includes non-operation of the PAYE system on foot of bogus self-employment<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently engaging with a wide range of industry stakeholders as part of the design process of the tax credit for the digital gaming sector. They will also have regard to relevant transferable elements of the s.481 film credit requirements in setting the criteria for the relief.  It is crucial that employee rights are upheld in all industries and my officials will be cognisant of this fact during the development of the tax credit.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the monitoring of compliance with employment rights legislation is primarily a matter for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through the Workplace Relations Commission. While the importance of employment rights will be reflected in the tax credit for the digital game sector, the WRC remains the appropriate avenue to address non-compliance with employment rights legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO01400"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[28118\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is a policy of data back-up in the operations of his Department and all agencies under his remit.","asker":"1514","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>For operational security reasons, my Department is not in a position to provide any details of its data security systems or those of the bodies under its aegis, as it would be inappropriate to disclose information that may in any way assist those with malicious intent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":546,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[28164\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide the research used to support the increase in stamp duty to 10% in the context of bulk buying housing; the way the research was sourced and from whom; the parameters that were used; the other taxation measures that were considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[28365\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a copy of the advice given that the new 10% rate will provide a really significant disincentive to bulk purchases in relation to the new 10% stamp duty on houses and duplexes.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 210 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, on Wednesday 19th May  a Financial Resolution before the D&aacute;il, was passed which had the immediate effect of imposing a stamp duty rate of 10% on the multiple purchase of 10 or more residential property units, subject to certain conditions and exemptions. <\/p>  <p>  This higher charge will also apply to a situation where a person acquires 10 units on a cumulative basis over a 12 month period with the 10% rate applying on the 10th purchase. Once triggered, the 10% rate will apply to any other residential properties acquired in that 12 month period.<\/p>  <p>  This 10% rate is intended to provide a significant disincentive to the practice that has recently emerged of institutional investors purchasing large parts of, or indeed whole, housing estates before they reach the market, thus denying first time buyers (and others) an opportunity to purchase a home.<\/p>  <p>  Acquisitions by Local Authorities and approved housing bodies are already exempt from stamp duty, and this exemption will continue to apply as regards this new higher rate. <\/p>  <p>  A key objective of this proposal is to achieve a balance between addressing the issue of multiple purchases by institutional investors, whilst at the same time ensuring the supply of financing is not undermined, particularly for the construction of new apartment developments. It therefore provides a specific exemption from the higher 10% stamp duty rate for the multiple purchase of apartments at any time, i.e. whether the apartments are being bought at planning permission stage or in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Without this exemption, it is felt that there would be a significant risk that developers would exit from the apartment building market as such projects would no longer be viable, and, if that were to happen, an important element of our housing strategy would be lost.<\/p>  <p>  The choice to set the rate at 10% was made by reference to existing stamp duty rates. In this regard,  the standard property rate for purchases under &euro;1m is 1%, with a 2% rate applying on amounts over &euro;1m. Therefore the view was that it had to be significantly higher than that rate to have the desired impact. In addition, it was felt that it had to be a higher rate than the existing 7.5% rate for commercial property. Consequently, it was concluded in this context that 10% was an appropriate rate as it is 10 times higher than the standard lower rate and one third higher than the rate for commercial property. Finally, it should be noted as with all taxes, this matter will be kept under review.<\/p>  <p>  The current UK stamp duty arrangement for companies was also looked at. It applies a higher rate of 15% for corporate bodies, or &ldquo;non-natural persons&rdquo;, which can be increased to 17% if the person is a non-resident, however the legislation has a long list of exemptions including property bought for rental purposes. We also established that the UK measure is a narrowly focussed anti-avoidance provision, which appears to have been designed to particularly address specific targeted situations. It was therefore felt that it was not an appropriate alternative to the stamp duty charge set out in the Finance Resolution. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the changes provided for in the Financial Resolution will be provided for in formal legislation in the next number of weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Tax","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO02100"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[28181\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500073#WRO02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the section or subsection of the Finance Act 2001 that grants the Revenue Commissioners VRT enforcement officers the power to offer and accept payment of a compromise penalty when the Revenue Commissioners have not received a notice of claim as specified by section 144(3)(a) of the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that its approach to enforcement of the law relating to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is that in each instance where a failure to comply with the relevant legal requirements is detected, the matter is dealt with in a manner that is fair and proportionate in the circumstances of the particular case.

It currently stands at &euro;12.30 per hour according to the Living Wage Technical Group document 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. The Low Pay Commission annually assesses the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The current national minimum hourly rate of pay, since 1 January 2021, is &euro;10.20 per hour, as set out in the National Minimum Wage Order (No. 2) 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The suggested Living Wage at &euro;12.30 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;23,747.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed data on civil service staff indicates that only some 0.2% of staff (FTE) in the civil service are on salary points less than &euro;23,747. Further to this, all civil servants are paid at rates above the minimum wage of &euro;10.20 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  Those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;23,747 may be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested living wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested living wage and above through incremental progression. <\/p>  <p>  Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022 provides for a general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500 (whichever is greater) on both 1 October 2021 and 2022, as well as the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund (in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement) on 1 February 2022. The Agreement is heavily weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments. By the end of the Agreement, the annualised pay increases will almost eliminate the cohort of civil servants earning less than the suggested living wage.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the Low Pay Commission has, on request of the Government, formally begun work on examining how Ireland could move towards a Living Wage. The study will examine the design of a living wage in an Irish context and consider the policy, social and economic implications.

The Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future<\/i>, commits to reducing and preventing homelessness and provides detail on how the Government is approaching this work as a priority. Homelessness is complex and causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery.  Therefore, a whole of Government approach is required in dealing with this challenge.<\/p><p>Important progress is being made, there was an almost 40% reduction of families in emergency accommodation in March based on the position one year previously representing the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation since March 2016.

The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing. Subject to the impact of the Covid related restrictions on the construction sector, the available funding is planned to deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes.<\/p><p>Work is actively underway at the moment on the preparation of a new strategic housing plan, <i>Housing for All<\/i>.  Measures to further address family homelessness are forming part of this work.  The Government will continue to prioritise responses for families experiencing homelessness and this is being reflected in both strategic policy and in specific actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500075#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":660,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500076#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":661,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[27466\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500076#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of houses completed under the pyrite scheme; the average payment to date; the highest payment under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1548","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":662,"content":"<p>The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of \"last resort\" applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave.

The NPF seeks to encourage their growth and to arrest the decline of areas that have experienced low population growth in recent years. Chapter 5.3 &lsquo;Planning for the Future Growth and Development of Rural Areas&rsquo; of the NPF features several specific National Policy Objectives (NPOs) that aim to support the overall rural and small town pattern of development in Ireland and deliver strengthened and diversified rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, National Planning Objective (NPO) 19 of the NPF aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other.  NPO 19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.<\/p>  <p>  Further, under National Policy Objective 18b my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.<\/p>  <p>  It is noteworthy that there is strong delivery of new homes in rural areas nationally in recent years, with almost 26,000 rural house planning permissions granted in last 5 years.

The Buy and Renew Scheme has facilitated local authorities to purchase 670 vacant properties for social housing purposes.  The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties. The scheme provides upfront funding to carry out the works and, in return, the property owner agrees to lease the dwelling to the local authority to be used as social housing for a period up to 25 years. The number of dwellings delivered under the RLS from July 2018 to end Q4 2020 is 225 dwellings. In November 2020, the maximum funding limit under the scheme was increased from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000. Feedback from local authorities is that this action has resulted in a significant increase in interest in the scheme. A budget of &euro;11m was secured for the RLS in 2021, providing funding for an additional 170 units to be delivered this year.<\/p><p>Additionally, my Department oversees the Housing Aid for Older People scheme, which provides grants of up to &euro;8,000 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out. Grant eligible works include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, repairs to or replacement of windows and doors, provision of water supply and sanitary facilities, provision of heating etc. The grant available operates on a sliding scale with the highest percentage grant available to those with the lowest incomes.  The scheme is means tested and grant assistance is not available to applicants whose household income, after disregards and deductions, exceeds &euro;60,000 per annum. Officials from my Department will begin a review of the existing grant limit and income thresholds applicable this year. <\/p><p>Further measures to address vacancy and to bring housing stock back into use will be considered in the context of the development of the Government&rsquo;s new housing strategy, Housing for All, which will be published this summer. <\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query on SEAI grants, this is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500080#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":823,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500080#WRV00800"},{"type":"question","counter":824,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[28348\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500080#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to extend the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme to include first time buyers undertaking substantial renovation works on second-hand properties; his plans to extend supports to first time buyers who are unable to receive full mortgages from banks in circumstances in which the first time buyer is seeking to purchase a second-hand property in need of substantial renovation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":825,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is designed to enable suitable first time buyers who cannot access sufficient mortgage finance from commercial lenders, to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range or to self build.

The absence of an insurance policy would result in further delays in resuming participation in election observation missions once safe to do so in the context of the public health pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's current International Election Observation Roster, which is facilitated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is effective as of 1 January 2019 and is scheduled to run until 2023. Roster members were selected on the basis of an open competitive application process in 2018. Issues related to the size and duration of the roster were addressed in Parliamentary Question No. 410 of 24 November 2020. The roster consists of 199 volunteers and thus there is a large pool of high-calibre election observers available, all of whom have been suitably vetted, for nomination to international election observation missions organised by the EU and OSCE.  Pre-COVID, there were an average of 45-60 observers deployed on EU and OSCE-ODIHR missions each year. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the next mustering process, it is anticipated that planning will include engagement with the Public Appointments Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500081#WRW00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":848,"content":"<p>Question No. 305 answered with Question No. 304.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":849,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500081#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":850,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[27523\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500081#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he is taking to urgently support the population of Gaza; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":851,"content":"<p>I would like to begin by welcoming the announcement of a ceasefire which began on 21 May.

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. <\/p><p>In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms such as Defence Forces vehicle fleet. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.<\/p><p>In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and for two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation.  No decisions have been made for the acquisition of additional aircraft in other roles.  Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of these enhanced capabilities.  <\/p><p>While the option of acquiring a wider military lift capability has been mentioned, it is not identified as an action for acquisition in the present 5 year Equipment Development Plan, which was developed through a joint civil military approach.<\/p><p>Should the situation arise in the future where the requirement to acquire military lift capability is identified as an action in the EDP, as with all capital investment decisions, costing over &euro;10 million, the requirements of the Public Spending Code would need to be met. These requirements cover the various steps required in assessing the viability of the proposal and those associated with relevant decision-making and potential subsequent public investment in any additional aircraft, including a thorough evaluation of potential cost savings. At this point in time no such evaluation has commenced. <\/p><p>Much of this longer range lift capability for military purposes is provided by way of chartering aircraft through a competitive procurement process on an as-required basis.  To date, this has been considered to be the most cost effective approach taking account of the acquisition, running and maintenance costs of larger aircraft in the context of their expected usage and contingency requirements.  The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability.<\/p><p>There are a total of four rotations of troops every year; two to UNDOF and two to UNIFIL.

From 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in second year and who are due to sit the Junior Cycle state examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. All students have now returned to school.<\/p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context.  <\/p>  <p>  The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning. <\/p>  <p>  My Department put a series of measures in place to assist schools in mitigating the impact of the school closures.  During the period of school closure, schools were required to implement a plan of action to enable continuity of learning for all pupils.  This involved teachers, including special education teachers, providing remote teaching and learning to all pupils in their class or on their caseload. <\/p>  <p>  These measures also included enhanced ICT grants, updated guidance for teaching and learning in a remote context and an expanded supplementary programme of learning to take place in students&rsquo; homes or in schools over the summer of 2020. Guidance was also provided to teachers to ensure that when schools reopened one of the priorities is to provide rich and progressive teaching and learning experiences for all pupils and, in so doing, to ensure that those learners most impacted by the school closure period are enabled to reconnect with and progress in their learning. Teachers were encouraged to focus on enabling pupils to learn, on developing their learning readiness, and on promoting pupil confidence in and motivation for learning in this context.  <\/p>  <p>  With schools now fully reopen, my Department will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the school closures on pupils\/students.  My Department is planning for an enhanced Summer Programme of learning for students at most risk of educational disadvantage or those with complex special educational needs. The aim of the 2021 Summer Programme is to mitigate, to the extent possible, the effects of prolonged school closures in 2021. My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate will engage with a sample of the schools providing the programme to evaluate the extent to which schools have been successful in meeting the aims of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above provisions, my Department announced an In-Person Supplementary Programme to support the education or care needs of primary and post primary pupils with complex needs. This programme of in-person support was intended to supplement the teaching and learning provided by the student&rsquo;s school and alleviate the impact of this period of school closure through the provision of 5 hours per week in-person teaching or care support to be delivered in homes. Further information is available here: www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/865df-in-person-supplementary-programme\/ <\/p>  <p>  In April of 2021, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published revised arrangements for the completion of Classroom Based Assessments for students in 2nd year in 2020\/2021 (cohort of students 2019 &ndash; 2022). These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 and 2020\/21 school year. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice in and reducing the number of Classroom-Based Assessments. The revised arrangements also remove the requirement for an Assessment Task to be completed. The adjustments were arrived at through consultation between my Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and key stakeholders. These revised arrangements are available here: www.ncca.ie\/en\/resources\/revised-arrangements-for-the-completion-of-classroom-based-assessments-cbas-for-students-in-second-year-in-20202021-1\/  <\/p>  <p>  Junior cycle papers are structured to reflect the learning outcomes based approach to the design of the subject specifications. This means that the elements are used to integrate the strands of the specifications resulting in assessments that require students to apply knowledge and skills acquired rather than examinations that depend on knowledge recall only.  Candidates are required to answer all questions and no choice is provided. Questions are not of equal length or marks. Making any changes to the format of the papers would undermine the approach taken by teachers in developing units of learning that mediate the curriculum specifications.<\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student-to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500083#WRY02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":950,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500083#WRY02500"},{"type":"question","counter":951,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[27668\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500083#WRY02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the basis for the new school design guide for sanitary facilities (details supplied); the steps that have been taken to consult with stakeholders including schools, students, parents and NGOs in relation to the new policy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":952,"content":"<p>Since the introduction of TGD-021-2 and TGD 021-3 in April 2014, the Department has undertaken a significant review exercise.

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  <\/p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022\/23 school year. <\/p><p>The disruption prevented the delivery of the necessary training and information workshops to support the roll out of the new allocation model which had been planned for earlier this year.<\/p><p>The frontloading of SNAs for mainstream classes is a key part of the School Inclusion Model.  The Department and NCSE are committed to its introduction as part of the development of that Model.<\/p><p>The training and workshops are designed to help school leaders and teachers in their in-school planning for the new model and their engagement with parents. These sessions will now be rescheduled to take place during the 2021\/22 school year. Further information will be issued by the NCSE in due course.<\/p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion and the Minister of State for Education have agreed on the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021\/22 school year: <\/p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will  automatically rollover into the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.<\/p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.<\/p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021\/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs  and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.<\/p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021\/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie\/for-schools<\/p><p>The NCSE will publish SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie by the end of May 2021.<\/p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.<\/p><p>Circular 0029\/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030\/2020 has been extended for the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p><p>Circular 0029\/2021 and Circular 0030\/2020 are available on the Departments website.<\/p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019, stated that the allocations being made for 2019 would initially remain in place for a minimum of two years, following which, revised profiled allocations would be considered for schools from September 2021. <\/p><p>The NCSE Policy advice &lsquo;A Proposed new Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014)&rsquo; on which the SET allocation model is based, recommended that &lsquo;the additional teaching supports be left in place initially for a two-year period. As the new model becomes embedded in the system, this may be extended to three years.&rsquo;<\/p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021\/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.<\/p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.<\/p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. <\/p><p>Maintaining the existing allocations of Special Education Teachers for the 2021\/22 school year means that schools will not have to engage in an extensive redeployment of posts, or re-clustering, this year.<\/p><p>It also means that schools will have greater levels of certainty as to the staff that they will have in place for September.<\/p><p>No school will see a cut, or reduction, to their special education teaching support next year.<\/p><p>Where schools have growing enrolments year on year, they will receive an increased allocation, pending the next re-profiling. <\/p><p>Even in circumstances where some schools were anticipating a greater level of increase year on year, if full re profiling had occurred next year, the increased allocations for developing status combined with the existing allocation of the school will show an increased overall teacher allocation for these schools in 2021\/22.<\/p><p>The allocations for 2021\/22 which are being maintained comprise the allocations which were made for schools from September 2019 plus any additionality achieved since plus any developing hours for the 2019\/20 and 2020\/21 school years.<\/p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process is

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019\/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Officials from the Department issued invitations for expressions of interest to 705 (612 DEIS and 95 non-DEIS) primary schools in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.<\/p>  <p>  The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.

Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of this process, 189 of the 281 schools that submitted an expression of interest were selected.  Of the 189 schools selected, 171 (90.5%) are DEIS and 18 (9.5%) are non-DEIS.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the fact that the funding available was limited to 35,000 children, it was not possible to include all schools that submitted and expression of interest to avail of hot school meals.

It is paid to blind people and certain people with low vision, aged 18 and up to the age of 66 who are habitually resident in the State.  At the end of April 2021 there were 1,069 persons in receipt of the Blind Pension.<\/p>  <p>  The means assessment reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those who need it most. <\/p>  <p>  In the means test, cash income that is assessed includes any income from employment or self-employment (and spouse\/partner, if applicable), income from a social security pension from another country and maintenance payments.   Recipients are supported to pursue employment or self-employment through earning disregards in the means test.  A recipient can earn up to &euro;120 per week from employment or self-employment without their payment being affected, while weekly earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed at 50%.  A &euro;20 increase in the earnings disregard was announced as part of Budget 2021 for both the Blind Pension and Disability Allowance which will take effect in June. This will see the first &euro;140 of earnings per week from employment or self-employment being disregarded for the purposes of the means test.  This increase will be applied automatically.<\/p>  <p>  The means test assesses the income the person may reasonably be expected to receive during the coming 12 months.  Where this is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the previous 12 months can be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.  Assessing a person&rsquo;s income in this manner takes account of the fact that some people&rsquo;s income is irregular, and they will earn more during some periods than others. <\/p>  <p>  Capital assessed as part of the means test includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares, as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. The family home is never assessed as part of the means test, regardless of who is the legal owner.  The first &euro;20,000 of capital from any source is not assessed, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, while any amount above &euro;40,000 is assessed at four euro per thousand.   <\/p>  <p>  People in receipt of the Blind Pension are also eligible for the Free Travel Scheme (free travel pass).  They may also qualify for other secondary benefits such as the fuel allowance, living alone increase and the household benefits package. Where a person is no longer in receipt of the Blind Pension, for example resulting from an improvement in their overall financial circumstances, they may retain their free travel pass, once they remain registered with the National Council of the Blind of Ireland (NCBI). <\/p>  <p>  A person who is in receipt of the Blind Pension may also qualify for the HSE means tested Blind Welfare Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, a supplement can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from a person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  In addition, officers can make a single exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Decisions on ENPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also provides the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance Scheme (BTWEA) which has been designed to support people, receiving certain social welfare payments, to become self-employed - this includes people in receipt of the Blind Pension and Disability Allowance. A person who avails of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance Scheme retains a percentage of their social welfare payment and will receive support through their Intreo Case Officer, who will also refer them to their Local Development Company (LDC) who will assist them to explore the viability of their business idea. Once accepted onto the scheme the person retains100% of their original payment in year one and 75% year two. <\/p>  <p>  Any proposals to change the means testing of payments, including for the Blind Pension, would have budgetary implications, and as such would need to be considered in the context of the annual budget process.  <\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1061,"content":"<p>Question No. 377 answered with Question No. 376.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":378,"qnumall":"[27571\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB01100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of audits of visually impaired persons in receipt of the blind persons pension that were carried out in 2018 and 2019; and the reason these audits were necessary in circumstances in which all recipients of the pension have very limited financial means.","asker":"1553","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1064,"content":"<p>Blind pension is a residency based means tested payment paid to blind and visually impaired people between the age of 18 and 66 who are habitually resident in the State.

It is important to note that a number of CE participants who are aged over 55 who commenced on the scheme before 2017 can stay on CE for six consecutive years.  <\/p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants, including those whose participation has been adversely affected during the pandemic and that CE schemes are supported over the forthcoming period as they re-commence more normal service levels.  <\/p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of these programmes and will continue to support and improve the programmes for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1078,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[27796\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she has received a report (details supplied) if so, the timeline for the publication of the report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1079,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[28013\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will publish a report by a company (details supplied) on the cost of disability before the end of May 2021; if not, the timeframe for publication given its importance to budget planning; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1080,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[28014\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when research into the cost of disability in the State carried out by a company (details supplied) will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1081,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[28388\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a report (details supplied) has been completed and submitted to her Department; if the delay in receiving the report will cause a delay in the publication of the report; and the date the report will be made available.","asker":"1560","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1082,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383, 414, 415 and 428 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has commissioned Indecon International Consultants to carry out research into the cost of disability.

In addition to these supports, my Department provides the following targeted measures:<\/p><p>The School Meals Programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefitting 230,000 children.  The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  It is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.  Since the start of the pandemic, Minister Humphreys has worked with colleagues in Government to ensure that funding continued to be provided for the school meals programme throughout the pandemic while schools were closed and over holiday periods.  The government has provided &euro;65.1m for the School Meals Programme in 2021.<\/p><p>As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019\/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  <\/p><p>In Budget 2021, an additional &euro;5.5m is being provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  The Department of Social Protection issued invitations for expressions of interest to 705 primary schools in November 2020.  A total of 281 expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.<\/p><p>The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected. As a result of this process, 189 of the 281 schools that submitted an expression of interest were selected.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection is the designated managing authority for the Operational Programme for the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) and has responsibility for the implementation of the programme in Ireland.  FEAD supports EU Member States&rsquo; actions to provide material assistance to the most deprived. The total value of the fund in Ireland is &euro;26.7m, &euro;4m of which will come from the Irish Exchequer.  FEAD support helps people take their first steps out of poverty and social exclusion and helps the most deprived people by addressing their most basic needs. Over &euro;16m has been spent on food since operations commenced in late 2016. There are over 150 charities, approved as Partner Organisations and over 5,100 tonnes of food has been distributed to communities through these charities.<\/p><p>In January 2020, Government published the Roadmap for Social for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 which aims to reduce poverty and improve social inclusion in Ireland. The Roadmap outlines 66 unique commitments for delivery across Government, including Commitment 61: &ldquo;<i>develop a comprehensive programme of work to further explore the drivers of food poverty and to identify mitigating actions<\/i>.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Following a meeting of the Social Inclusion Roadmap Steering Group on 30 March 2021, I announced the establishment of a Working Group to tackle the issue of food poverty. I have recently written to relevant Departments seeking nominations of members for this group and draft terms of reference will be agreed when the group first meets.  This group will provide updates on its work to the Social Inclusion Roadmap Steering Group, which I chair.<\/p><p>I thank the Deputy for her question and hope this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1086,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1087,"qnumday":385,"qnumall":"[27827\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB03500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason that children whose carers that have been allocated a free travel pass have not themselves being allocated a free travel pass; and the estimated cost for implementing such a process.","asker":"1452","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1088,"content":"<p>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 996,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The 2021 funding allocation for the free travel scheme is &euro;95 million.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department does not provide a free travel pass to children aged under 16, for whom a person is receiving carer's allowance, my Department does provide additional support in the form of the domiciliary care allowance.  The domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.  <\/p>  <p>  Support is also available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA).  A travel supplement may be awarded in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Children aged 16 or over may apply for disability allowance.  Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a disability and a person can continue to attend school while receiving the payment. A child in receipt of disability allowance is entitled to a free travel pass in his\/her own right.<\/p>  <p>  Providing an accurate projection of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to all children whose carers have been allocated a free travel pass is very difficult as the cost is determined by the usage of the extra passes provided and not by the number of newly qualified people.  The fact that many operators have reduced fares for children and that in some cases children under five years of age can travel for free would also have to be taken into account.  Taking all of this into consideration I am advised that the yearly cost of the measure suggested by the Deputy could be as high as an estimated &euro;6.1 million. <\/p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to all children whose carers have been allocated a free travel pass would require additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":1089,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1090,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[27829\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500086#WRBB03800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when the work placement and experience programme announced as part of the July jobs stimulus is due to commence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1091,"content":"<p>In the July Jobs Stimulus the Government committed to a &euro;200m investment in training, education, skill development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies and jobs search and assistance measures aimed to help those who have lost their jobs find a new one, retrain or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors.  Included in this is provision for a funded work placement scheme to provide work experience for jobseekers who have been unemployed for more than six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) and regardless of age. A particular objective is to provide a mechanism for those unemployed to pivot into new employment in new sectors through additional learning with new and relevant work experience.<\/p>  <p>  Work is nearing completion on the development of this work placement scheme to provide work experience for jobseekers that have been unemployed for more than six months (to include time spent on PUP ).  This initiative builds on advice from the Labour Market Advisory Council that such placements have the capacity to keep unemployed people close to the labour market and provide them with quality work experience to increase their employability.  Moreover, work placements afford employers the opportunity to contribute to the national activation agenda.  The use of work placements to straddle the transition from education and training to full-time employment has proven successful in the past and it is important that a new scheme under development provides valuable work experience for jobseekers.<\/p>  <p>  With COVID related public health restrictions impacting on social mobility and business operations, it has not been possible to commence the programme over the past number of months.  However, work has been steadily progressing to design and deliver a comprehensive programme to support 10,000 work placements for jobseekers with some 5,000 host organisations.

school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefitting 230,000 children.  The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.<\/p><p>Funding under the school meals (local projects) scheme can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, hot meals and afterschool clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided e.g. &euro;1.40 per child per day where a cold lunch club is being provided, &euro;1.90 per child per day where a dinner club is being provided and &euro;2.90 per child per day where a Hot Meal club is being provided.  Dinner clubs provide a hot meal, but are different from the Hot Meals clubs, in that they tend to be provided by schools with onsite cooking facilities whereas food for Hot Meals clubs is cooked offsite and delivered to the school. <\/p><p>As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019\/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  <\/p><p>In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  My Department issued invitations for expressions of interest to 705 primary schools in November 2020.  A total of 281 expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.<\/p><p>The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected.  <\/p><p>As a result of this process, 189 of the 281 schools that submitted an expression of interest were selected. <\/p><p>A breakdown of the number of primary schools, post-primary schools, special schools, alternative education settings and schools by county is contained in table 1 in the attached tabular statement.

the average time persons wait for a payment to be made; and the number of successful reviews upon request by month since April 2020, in tabular form.","asker":"1453","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1137,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) has proven to be a vital income support to workers, thousands of whom lost their jobs virtually overnight. Since the introduction of the scheme over 23.7 million payments have been made to over 850,000 people providing income support of some 7.6 billion to date. Within 3 weeks of inception (on 7 April 2020) the scheme made payments to 507,000 people. Over the last 14 months, just under 2 million PUP claims were received and processed.   <\/p>  <p>  Arrears arise under the following broad headings. First, there may have been an initial time lag in the commencement of payments. The quickest and most efficient way to apply for PUP is online. Applications received up to Thursday evening are processed for payment that week with payment made on the following Tuesday.  Second, arrears may also arise in respect of individual weeks where claims could not be processed due to incomplete applications or data mismatches. Third, arrears may be due where the rate on a claim has been increased with retrospective effect. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the first two issues, my Department developed an automated process, which examines each case and looks at their overall entitlement to payment and matches this against their payment history. As a result, 286,000 people received arrears payments totalling &euro;129 million on 1 December 2020 for unpaid weeks in the period from March to November 2020. Following this, my Department worked to ensure that this automated process can be efficiently replicated on an ongoing basis. Following the reintroduction of Covid health restrictions in December 2020, the numbers in receipt of the PUP increased by almost 200,000 between 22 December and 26 January 2021. Using the automated process outlined above, just over 90,000 people received an arrears payment totalling over &euro;49 million on 20 April in respect of the period from December 2020 to April 2021. This process now runs on a monthly basis and I can inform the Deputy that just under 9,000 people are receiving arrears totalling over &euro;3.7 million on 25 May 2021 in respect of the period from April to 13 May.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the third issue, cases have mainly emerged where new earnings data has been supplied to the Department or where earnings bands and earnings reference periods have been changed. In September 2020, approximately 15,000 individuals were due arrears of just under &euro;10 million in respect of newly reported earnings, and these were paid at that time. In addition, in October 2020 just over 45,000 people were due arrears following changes to the earnings bands and associated reference periods introduced at that time. These arrears, totalling &euro;14.7 million, were paid in February and March 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, individual cases will arise where arrears may have to be awarded on a manual basis by my Department. However, given the overall number of persons in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the volume of associated transactions, manual processing of arrears payments on a wide scale is neither feasible nor efficient. <\/p>  <p>  The total amount paid by way of arrears as outlined above represents just under 3% of total expenditure on the PUP to date, an indication of the highly effective and speedy response of my Department to the unprecedented challenges of the Covid-19 Pandemic. I can assure the Deputy that my Department is fully committed to ensuring the prompt and timely processing of applications for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, including any associated arrears.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500087#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500087#WRCC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1139,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[27904\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500087#WRCC02900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the position of employees in her Department who are seconded to other agencies during their work life; the way their salaries are treated for the purposes of pension contributions and entitlements; the reason a person (details supplied) who has been seconded from F&Aacute;S and then to her Department has had a high portion of their salary treated differently in relation to superannuation contributions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1140,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[27905\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500087#WRCC03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an employee (details supplied) in her Department who is on secondment to a separate agency for extensive periods of time still enjoys the benefits of being an employee of her Department; if they have the right to initiate the employee grievance procedures of her Department as do other employees; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1141,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 409 together.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) rules, civil servants on secondment maintain their terms and conditions of employment including salary during their period of secondment.

Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, is: <\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres, with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports; <\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people. Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months.  A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months);<\/p>  <p>   - Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed; <\/p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited; <\/p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to apprenticeships, the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was launched last month by my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The Action Plan sets out a five-year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025.  The plan provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for employers and apprentices, which will prove attractive for many young people.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age. This programme will seek to encourage businesses provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job.&rdquo; The programme aims to particularly incentivise the participation of young people through an attractive weekly uplift to their weekly welfare entitlement. It is anticipated that those currently on the Youth Employment Support Scheme will be permitted to transfer across to the new programme providing the participant and host are both agreeable. I expect to bring the Programme to government shortly for consideration and anticipate a launch of the programme shortly thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  These initiatives will be further strengthened by Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which is currently being finalised by my Department.  Pathways to Work is the Government&rsquo;s national employment services strategy.  It will set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market.  This whole-of-Government strategy will seek to build upon those support measures outlined above as we assist young people on their journey to work.  <\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position at this time for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500087#WRCC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500087#WRCC03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[27930\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500087#WRCC03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an example of the way the disability allowance means test operates step by step in circumstances (details supplied); and the maximum figures for the spouse&rsquo;s employment that are possible under the means test under such circumstances which would still entitle the disability allowance applicant to the maximum rate of disability allowance and at least &euro;1 of disability allowance per week.","asker":"1567","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p>Eligibility for disability allowance (DA) is conditional on satisfying the medical criteria,  a means test and being habitually resident in the state.<\/p><p>Where a person is married, in a civil partnership or co-habiting, the Department will assess the means of the person applying for a social assistance payment and the means of their partner when carrying out a means test.<\/p><p>In order to qualify for receipt of DA, the total household means must be below the means threshold.

It has also agreed that the HSE will retain responsibility for the delivery of these services post-transfer. It should be noted that the transfer of these services does not encompass mainstream health services delivered to people with disabilities which will remain under the Department of Health.

Services include personal assistant, home support, multi-disciplinary and other community supports. Services are delivered through a mix of HSE direct provision as well as through non-statutory Section 38 and 39 service providers, and a small number of private providers.

This scheme provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people. It gives participants opportunities to improve their general level of education, gain certification, develop their skills and prepare for employment, self-employment and further education and training.  The scheme is operated through local Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and is aimed in particular at unemployed people who are early school-leavers.<\/p><p>The Programme and Learner Support System (PLSS) manages the application process for FET provision. While there are no waiting lists by ETB within PLSS, it is possible to identify the number of learners who are waiting to hear if they have been accepted onto a VTOS course.When an applicant registers their interest in an FET course, either online or manually, their application is recorded as received on the system. Subsequently as the application is scrutinised the status moves to &ldquo;being processed&rdquo;.  An analysis of PLSS indicates that there are 537 individuals who have one of these two statuses and are waiting to hear if they have been accepted onto a VTOS course that will start later in 2021 when the 2021\/22 academic year begins. It is important to note that the status of these individuals is not an indication of the existence of capacity issues.<\/p><p>It is not possible to estimate the cost to the state of removing the eligibility criteria that participants must have been unemployed for six months prior to starting a VTOS course as no information is held in relation to how many of this cohort would take up a VTOS course if they were eligible. However, it is important to stress that the existence of the six month rule is not driven by budgetary considerations, but rather by the policy imperative to tailor provision to the needs of the target cohort.<\/p><p>Participants on VTOS receive a training allowance in lieu of their Social Welfare payment as well as travel and meal allowances.VTOS course content, ranging from basic education and training to advanced vocational training, is aimed at individuals who are considered to need significant interventions, to increase their employability. Accordingly, eligibility is restricted to individuals who have  been unemployed for at least 6 months for this reason.A suite of alternative FET provision is available to cater for individuals who are more recently unemployed, i.e., less than six months. This includes Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) options and a range of training initiatives.<\/p><p>The number of VTOS Core Learner enrolments per ETB for 2020 is in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>ETB<\/th>       <th>VTOS CORE Learners Numbers 2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>City of Dublin ETB<\/td>       <td>399<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal ETB<\/td>       <td>200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB<\/td>       <td>360<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway and Roscommon ETB<\/td>       <td>456<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry ETB<\/td>       <td>179<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare and Wicklow ETB<\/td>       <td>718<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny and Carlow ETB<\/td>       <td>287<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois and Offaly ETB<\/td>       <td>279<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick Clare ETB<\/td>       <td>755<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford and Westmeath ETB<\/td>       <td>119<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth and Meath ETB<\/td>       <td>205<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB<\/td>       <td>432<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary ETB<\/td>       <td>149<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford and Wexford ETB<\/td>       <td>839<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total<\/td>       <td>5377<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500090#WRFF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1294,"content":"<p>Question No. 462 answered with Question No. 461.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1295,"content":"<p>Question No. 463 answered with Question No. 461.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":1296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500090#WRFF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1297,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[27785\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500090#WRFF02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of additional tutors that have been hired to teach apprentices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1298,"content":"<p>The information requested is being sought from the Education and Training Boards by SOLAS and I will arrange for it to be sent directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500090#WRFF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":1299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500090#WRFF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1300,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[27906\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500090#WRFF03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason students from Ballyfermot College of Further Education that have spent two years on a higher national diploma advanced production and design course and want to continue onto a BA hons visual media (game design) are not eligible for the SUSI grant in order to undertake the degree course (details supplied); and if the anomaly will be addressed.","asker":"1485","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1301,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the college to which he refers, is an approved Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) centre which is managed and funded by City of Dublin ETB.

This Strategy includes a commitment to develop the work of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) to include targeted work with &lsquo;harder-to-reach&rsquo; young people. This includes young people heavily involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, for whom there are little supports and interventions available in practice, unless they are before the courts, in which case they may be under the supervision of the Probation Service. The Strategy also prioritises early intervention work, including with younger children who are assessed as being at serious risk. Both these cohorts may include children at risk of recruitment by crime gangs.<\/p><p>The development of this work within the GYDP network will be supported by the REPPP Project, (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice), at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP has led on the &ldquo;Greentown Report&rdquo;, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, and was published in December 2016. The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and the Department of Justice. <\/p><p>The Greentown Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations.  <\/p><p>The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke design process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. <\/p><p>Pilot applications of the Greentown programme, developed by the REPPP, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these pilots will then be incorporated into mainstream GYDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial pilots from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years.  <\/p><p>The implementation of the Greentown pilot programme is part of the Strategic Objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This implementation process began with the establishment of the Governance and Strategy Group, and the Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by the Department of Justice, which will provide oversight arrangements for Youth Justice Initiatives, including the Greentown pilots, to ensure that there is a cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500091#WRGG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regulatory Bodies","counter":1365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500091#WRGG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1366,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[27593\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500091#WRGG03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the procedures in place in relation to the Property Services Regulatory Authority in dealing with official complaints that are lodged with the authority; the number of complaints received by the authority in each of the years 2015 to 2020, in tabular form; the number of those complaints that are still live; the number now fully closed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1367,"content":"<p>The Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) is a statutory body established to regulate property services providers.

As an essential service, FSI have remained open throughout all stages of Covid-19 restrictions, with the key objective of providing a sustainable service while keeping their staff safe. In December 2019, the fingerprints and documents &amp;amp; handwriting services of the Garda Technical Bureau were transferred to FSI.<\/p>  <p>  FSI reported on close to 22,000 investigations in 2020, including almost 6,000 from fingerprints and documents &amp;amp; handwriting. This represents an increase of 36% in reported cases compared to 2019. FSI also expanded its intelligence services over the course of the year. FSI supported the validation and preparations for fingerprint exchange as part of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in 2020. Ireland also currently exchanges fingerprint data with Austria, Romania and the Czech Republic under the Pr&uuml;m agreement. FSI expanded connectivity for Pr&uuml;m DNA Exchanges, with 8 countries now actively exchanging material (Austria, Latvia, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Slovakia, Poland, Sweden and Estonia) with further expansions planned for 2021. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that FSI also completed a comprehensive drugs quantification trend reports for the previous 4 years (2016 &ndash; 2019) on heroin, cocaine and amphetamine and shared these insights with stakeholders in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Health.  FSI is also the custodian of the national DNA database.  At the end of 2020 there were close to 50,000 DNA profiles on the national DNA database. The number of reference profiles increased by 8,631 in 2020 and the number of crime-scene profiles increased by 1,555. The impact of the database has also increased over time, with 47% of uploaded crime-stains now linked to a person. <\/p>  <p>  2020 was the first year where the fingerprints and documents and handwriting services have been provided by FSI. The integration of these services as well as the growth in demand for drugs and DNA investigates have led to a 74% increase in case submissions when compared to 2018. For 2020 alone, drugs &amp;amp; toxicology submissions increased by 26% and more specifically, complex case submissions (related to possession with intent to supply, or cultivation) increased by 34%.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, approximately 29,000 cases were submitted to FSI and reports were issued in 22,000 cases.  FSI is working to address the capacity issues relating to the increased demand for their services in a number of ways.<\/p>  <p>  FSI works with its principal service user, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ensure that cases where analysis is urgently required are prioritised.  FSI prioritised the more complex drug submissions and reported close to the same number of such cases as in 2019, despite the pandemic. They have also supported all urgent drugs cases (typically custody cases) within the 24-hour timeframe agreed with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, despite a significant increase in demand (31% on 2019). FSI increased the number of DNA case reports by 24% in 2020 and reported on all Body Identifications within the agreed timeframe, despite a significant increase (23% on 2019). <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that FSI staffing has increased significantly in recent years and further recruitment is underway.

The outbreak resulted in 38 confirmed prisoner cases and a large number of staff cases.  Previous outbreak situations in prisons were, in general, restricted to one location within the prison however, given the increased infectivity with this strain of the virus there were cases of Covid-19 confirmed in most areas of the prison.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has a comprehensive contingency plan for the management of Covid-19 outbreaks.  Upon confirmation of an outbreak situation, an Outbreak Control Team is established to oversee the management of the outbreak. An Outbreak Control Team, led in this case by the Director General, and comprising of prison management; Healthcare staff; National Infection Control; with representatives from the HR Directorate, Operations Directorate; and the Prison Officers Association was established on 7 May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Outbreak Control Team managed the outbreak in line with the Irish Prison Service National Covid-19 Contingency Plan. The Plan sets out the actions to be taken with regard to the restriction of the confirmed case(s), contact tracing and the restriction of all prisoner movements while testing, contact tracing and assessment of risk are taking place. The Plan also sets out the arrangements to be made for the mass testing of all prisoners and staff.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Contingency Plan where there is a positive Covid-19 case in the general prison population, all prisoner movement in the prison is restricted while testing, contact tracing and assessment of the risk of the spread of the infection continues. Prisoners involved in the provision of services within the prison (kitchen, laundry etc.) continue to work with an enhanced level of PPE providing they are not a close contact of any confirmed case. Prisoners are fed and medicated at their door and are permitted to leave their cell in a controlled manner to make telephone calls.<\/p>  <p>  Once the results of first round testing of all prisoners and all staff are received, any prisoners with negative test results have a degree of regime restored which strives to meet the minimum out of cell time provision of two hours. Positive prisoners and their close contacts are isolated or quarantined in accordance with HSE guidance.<\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service engaged with the Health Service Executive with regard to the arrangements for the mass testing of all staff, with the mass testing of prisoners carried out by Mountjoy Prison Healthcare teams. All prisoners and staff were tested twice as per the Contingency Plan. It is the case that until the level of risk is eliminated the prison must continue to operate on a restricted regime in order to prevent the possible spread of infection.<\/p>  <p>  An extensive communications plan was implemented in Mountjoy Prison to inform all key stakeholders of the actions being taken throughout the process. The Outbreak Control team was stood down on 21 May 2021 following the successful containment of the spread of virus and the prison was returned to a more normal regime.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 vaccination for prisoners is being administered by the National Ambulance Service, supported by Irish Prison Service medical teams. Prisoners aged over 70 have received their Covid-19 vaccination, resulting in 82 prisoners having received the vaccine to date. Approximately 360 staff, primarily involved in the escorting of prisoners to hospital, have also received their Covid-19 vaccine. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has been engaging with the HSE\/Department of Health with regard to the logistical arrangements for the administration of the vaccine to the remaining prisoner and staff cohort, and these discussions are at an advanced stage and expected to conclude shortly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500092#WRHH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1403,"content":"<p>Question No. 499 answered with Question No. 476.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sex Offenders Notification Requirements","counter":1404,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500092#WRHH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1405,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[27918\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500092#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied with the level of compliance by persons who are subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001; the number of notifications received from other jurisdictions or from Interpol regarding the travel of convicted sex offenders to Ireland during the period 2009 to 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1406,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, a person found guilty in court of a sexual offence automatically becomes subject to the registration \/ notification requirements of Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001.

The processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, with the case law of the European Court of Justice underlining the importance of free movement of personal data and establishing that Member States are not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has also advised my Department that section 30 of the 2018 Act appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1) (f), read alongside Recital (47). Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f).  The commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has also confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1) (f) of the GDPR does not make the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing unlawful. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38). <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, the Commission have indicated that the term \"micro-targeting\", as referenced in Section 30 of the Act, is not mentioned in the GDPR, and its scope remains uncertain and undefined.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In order for a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application.  It is not clear under section 30 what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of micro-targeting.  It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise so as to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are keeping this issue under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500092#WRHH05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cybersecurity Policy","counter":1441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500092#WRHH05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1442,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[28848\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500092#WRHH05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the investment made by her Department and State agencies under its remit in each year in cybersecurity for the past ten years.","asker":"1504","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1443,"content":"<p>For reasons of operational and national security it would not be appropriate to disclose details, including costs, of my Department&rsquo;s cyber security arrangements, or those of State offices, agencies and bodies under my remit.

In 2018, the Commission published a proposal to amend the Control Regulation. <\/p>  <p>  Negotiations on the proposal are ongoing at Council Working Party.  The Portuguese Presidency had indicated its intention to bring a general approach on the proposal to the Council of Fisheries Ministers in May.  However, it is likely that this will now be dealt with at the June Council.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal has also been discussed by the European Parliament.  The draft report by the Parliament's Fisheries Committee on the proposal was adopted at the European Parliament plenary in March.

In relation to the margin of tolerance, Ireland is supportive of the Commission's proposal to maintain a limited and necessary margin of tolerance, which is set at 10%.  Such margins are required for practical purposes but need to be limited in nature to ensure accurate reporting of catches, which is a core pillar of the Common Fisheries Policy. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) measures such as on-board CCTV, Ireland is supportive of the introduction of a risk-based REM system.  As a Coastal Member State, we are seeking access to the data gathered within this system on a near real time basis to support the work of the Naval Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  This a critically important tool given the control obligations that Ireland has in respect of all vessels operating in our 200 mile zone.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department has been engaged fully in the negotiation process and continues to be actively involved in the ongoing discussion with the Presidency, other Member States and the Commission on the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500093#WRJJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1452,"content":"<p>Question No. 516 answered with Question No. 515.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":1453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500093#WRJJ00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1454,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[27451\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500093#WRJJ00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason there has not been a significant increase in the issuing of private licences for the weeks ending 16 April, 23 April, 30 April and 7 May 2021 when over this same period Coillte has only issued seven felling licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1455,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[27452\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500093#WRJJ00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide a definition of Coillte felling and private felling based on the forestry licensing dashboard, as presented by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1456,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[27453\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500093#WRJJ01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"where Coillte submits a licence application and it is not the landowner but acts as an agent for the landowner, if the data get presented as Coillte or private on the weekly dashboard when the licence is issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1457,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 517 to 519, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  While there was a decrease in Coillte licences issued in the period mentioned by the Deputy, work continued on a batch of 1,864 applications received from Coillte on 15 March 2021. <\/p>  <p>  There is a significant amount of background work involved in the licensing process long before a licence issues and this work is currently ongoing.

Native woodlands are an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage, history and culture, and are unique in terms of their biodiversity. They are home to specialised native woodland animals, birds, insects and plants. They provide numerous ecosystem services, including the protection and enhancement of water quality, wider habitat linkage, landscape enhancement, opportunities for outdoor recreation and interpretation, wider rural development linkages, and carbon capture. <\/p>  <p>  Further to a request for support for exploration of possibilities for native woodland creation on former industrial cutaway peatlands by Bord na M&oacute;na, the Department, has developed a Pilot Scheme that is intended to facilitate the establishment of new native woodlands on state owned former industrial cutover peatlands on a pilot basis. This Pilot Scheme will facilitate native woodland regeneration at landscape scale, aiming at minimum intervention, and is compatible with other forms of peatland restoration measures at this scale. <\/p>  <p>  The overall purpose of the Pilot Scheme is to support biodiversity, help reduce carbon emissions and stabilise soils to minimise soil erosion. These objectives are therefore different to the objectives of the current Afforestation Scheme.  The Pilot Scheme aims at mimicking natural vegetation establishment processes in high, dry areas and on slopes that are not suitable for re-wetting. Bord na M&oacute;na intends to complement their rehabilitation plans for end-of-life cutaway bogs by creating a mosaic of wetlands and sparse woodlands that enhances biodiversity value, stabilises the loose peatland soil and reduces carbon losses.

Over 36,000 carcasses were inspected in total.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, during unannounced checks, classification officers conducted an average of 14 inspections across the 22 mechanical factories and classified an average of 100 carcasses at each inspection. To date in 2021, classification officers conducted 80 inspections in factories applying mechanical classification and over 8,000 carcasses have been inspected. <\/p>  <p>  The number of inspections significantly exceed the requirement under the relevant EU legislation. The EU legal requirement for monitoring classification is eight inspections per factory per year and must include a minimum of 40 carcasses at each inspection. <\/p>  <p>  Unannounced checks by classification officers verify the on-going accuracy of the automated beef grading methods by using a system of points and limits defined in EU legislation. The mechanical classification method must operate within legally defined tolerances at all times. As with any mechanical system, grading machines can from time to time fall out of tolerance. <\/p>  <p>  Where a machine is found operating outside of tolerance, the factory is instructed to cease mechanical classification and to revert to manual grading.  In this scenario, the factory must arrange for the classification machine to be serviced. When this service is completed, the classification section is notified, and classification officers will proceed to conduct a further classification exercise (minimum 100 carcasses) to confirm that the machine is working within the legal tolerances before mechanical grading is allowed to recommence. Farmers are advised through their remittance dockets where manual grading is applied. <\/p>  <p>  The suspension of mechanical grading following an inspection by DAFM occurred on four occasions in 2020.

Circular 5 of 2021 of 5th May 2021 sets out clarifications that my Department has received under the Planning and Development Regulations from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  As ash dieback disease progresses nationally and within individual plantations, the potential health and safety risks associated with roadside, parkland and forest plantation ash trees will become an issue of increasing importance for land owners, workers and visitors. The Department is aware of these risks. Site specific health and safety issues together with any mitigation measures are the responsibility of the landowner and, ahead of any planned harvesting or forest visits, a risk assessment should be completed to identify potential hazards and mitigation required. This type of health and safety assessment is routinely completed by contractors ahead of any harvesting. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the impact and distribution of ash dieback disease surveys, since the first finding in 2012 the Department has surveyed the disease. Part of the 2020 survey included a systematic survey of National Forest Inventory points across the country leading to further findings.  By the end of 2020, there had been findings in ash in over 660 locations in various settings &ndash; forests, nurseries and garden centres, on farm planting, roadside planting, hedgerows and private gardens in all 26 counties. The future viability of ash is under very serious threat. Experience of ash dieback disease observed in most European countries, is that it results in large scale tree mortality and threatens the existence of the ash trees all over the continent. The disease is now widespread in Ireland. However, approximately 1% - 3 % of a given population of ash will be naturally tolerant to the disease and this tolerance is heritable and is stable in trees that are propagated vegetatively and research nationally support by the Department and internationally to establish populations of tolerant material and make it available over the medium and long term.<\/p>  <p>  Research is underway on the impact of rot and decay of ash wood impacted by ash dieback disease.  A new research project jointly funded by the Department and DAERA in Northern Ireland called  NEXCELSIOR &ldquo;Next steps in managing the impact of ash dieback disease&rdquo; &ndash; aims to develop evidence-based guidance for foresters to minimise the impact of ash dieback and to maximise the recovery of timber or other products\/services and preserve ash as a component in Irish forests and hedgerows. One of the aspects of the project is to assess degradation resulting from dieback infection, to allow the development of recommendations for best practice in timber recovery from ash stands.<\/p>  <p>  With the introduction of any new scheme, meetings are organised to discuss scheme requirements and implementation with staff and identify any issues that may arise.  These meetings provide for two-way feedback and the opportunity for Department inspectors to express their views including any concerns they may have. Virtual events have been held to brief Department Inspectors on the Reconstitution and Underplanting scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500094#WRKK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1544,"content":"<p>Question No. 545 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1545,"content":"<p>Question No. 546 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1546,"content":"<p>Question No. 547 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1547,"content":"<p>Question No. 548 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1548,"content":"<p>Question No. 549 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1549,"content":"<p>Question No. 550 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1550,"content":"<p>Question No. 551 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1551,"content":"<p>Question No. 552 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1552,"content":"<p>Question No. 553 answered with Question No. 544.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":1553,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500094#WRKK04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1554,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[27728\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500094#WRKK05000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the initiatives he has taken and proposes to take to develop new markets for the Irish pig farming sector; if he has met with relevant stakeholders on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1555,"content":"<p>Increasing international market access for Irish agri-food exports is a core element of the current Food Wise strategy, which recognises that market access and development is essential to add value to the meat sector in particular. The market development part of the strategy is being implemented by a seven-point action plan launched in April 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to pigmeat specifically, the work of the Department is focused not only on opening new markets but also on enhancing and retaining access to existing international markets. Market priorities are agreed with meat industry representatives each year and regular meetings are held to discuss developments and update them on progress. A recent example of new market access was the opening of the Mexican market for raw frozen pigmeat in May 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  In January 2021, the Department finalised the registration of five Irish pigmeat plants with the Vietnamese competent authority to export pork offal which should enable a further expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s established pigmeat trade to Vietnam. The aim of market access work across all meat species is to ensure that the industry has viable outlets for all parts of the animal carcase which will satisfy a variety of consumer demands, tastes and price points in importing countries. <\/p>  <p>  The success of the Department's market access efforts is reflected in CSO trade statistics which show that Ireland exports pigmeat to almost 60 countries with the top five destinations being the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Denmark and Germany. Cumulatively, these five destinations accounted for some 80% of pigmeat exports in volume terms in 2020. The value of pigmeat exports have also increased by almost 12% since 2017 with volumes remaining largely stable and averaging 278.000 tonnes annually over the same period. The portion of pigmeat exports going to third country markets outside of the EU and the UK has grown in volume terms from 37% in 2017 to 51% last year. In that same period, the total value of Irish pigmeat exports to those markets has increased by nearly &euro;135 million, an increase of two-thirds in just four years. <\/p>  <p>  Engagement with relevant stakeholders is ongoing and was recently expanded with the inaugural meeting on 28th April of the pig roundtable chaired by my colleague Minister of State Martin Heydon T.D.  <\/p>  <p>  Further information on my Department&rsquo;s initiatives in opening and developing overseas outlets for the agri-food sector is available in the Market Access Report which is available on gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>   The Market Access Portal on gov.ie provides details on the full range of open markets and the relevant certification conditions negotiated with importing countries for a wide range of agri-food product categories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500094#WRKK05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":1557,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500095#WRLL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1558,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[27808\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500095#WRLL00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason another office (details supplied) has been set up in relation to unfair practices and corruption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1559,"content":"<p>The establishment of an Office of a National Food Ombudsman, or Regulator, is a key commitment in the Programme for Government.

Under the Animal Health and Welfare Act, 2013, the Department has primary policy responsibility for the welfare of all animals, including equines. <\/p>  <p>  The Act puts clear obligations on owners to look after animals under their care. Neglect of, or causing unnecessary suffering to, animals is not acceptable and my Department continues to enforce the law in this important area. <\/p>  <p>  Prosecutions under the Act have been pursued following investigations by authorised officers of the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and authorised officers of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  These officers investigate matters relating to animal cruelty and neglect and, where the evidence supports such action, a file prepared and the matter pursued through the Courts. <\/p>  <p>  The Department works closely with these bodies and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all involved for their work in the field of animal welfare. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government (PFG) places a positive emphasis on animal welfare and specifically commits to the continued robust enforcement of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  Also included in the PFG is a commitment to provide for additional urban horse welfare programmes. The Department continues to take a proactive approach in tackling challenges by developing facilities for urban horse populations and in educating young people among these communities in the care and welfare of horses. This work is carried out in close collaboration with the Local Authorities, and is reflected in the new Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025. <\/p>  <p>  The Department continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to people in disadvantaged areas. As an example, the DSPCA with financial assistance from the Department, continues to facilitate castration and ID clinics and education programmes in an effort to address the problem of over-breeding which can add to welfare issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government  also contains an undertaking to provide additional funding to support animal welfare in the coming years to which I am fully committed. In this regard, in December 2020, I announced record funding of &euro;3.2 million to 101 animal welfare organisations throughout the country  including those engaged in equine welfare. <\/p>  <p>  The Control of Horses Act, 1996 is currently under review within the Department and plans for replacement legislation are well advanced.  The Department will be further engaging on this with stakeholders. Under the Act, Local Authorities may take a range of actions in relation to equines including prohibiting horses in certain areas, the issuing of licences, the seizure of horses in contravention of the Act.  These powers can be used in respect of straying horses which includes horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission, including public land.  The Local Authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may also prosecute offenders under this Act. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway within the Department to undertake a national equine census by the end of this year. This will establish the number of equines in the country and the residences at which they habitually reside. Further development of a central database to provide for the easy updating of equine residence data is also planned for 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline through which members of the public can report incidents of animal cruelty or neglect for investigation. <\/p>  <p>  The dedicated e-mail address and Helpline in place for reporting suspected cases of animal welfare are:  <\/p>  <p>  Helpline Phone No: Call Save - 0761 064408, phone - 01 607 2379.  <\/p>  <p>  Email address -  animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500095#WRLL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1600,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[28362\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500095#WRLL04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of equine seizures that were recorded in Cork city and county.","asker":"1453","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1601,"content":"<p>Under the Control of Horses Act 1996, Local Authorities may take a range of actions in relation to equines including prohibiting horses in certain areas, the issuing of licenses and the seizure of horses in contravention of the Act.

All policy is underpinned by broad consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including rural and urban stakeholder groups, young people and the wider public, Government Departments and State Agencies. This engagement process provides important insights into issues impacting on rural and urban communities and in identifying areas for response relevant to the work of my Department. <\/p><p>My Department introduced specific supports, interventions and funding packages, having accessed the emerging needs of urban and rural communities impacted by COVID-19. A range of COVID-19 related supports were introduced to support the response and recovery from the pandemic in 2020 including; COVID-19 Stability Fund; Broadened Community Enhancement Programme; Town &amp;amp; Village Renewal &ndash; Accelerated Measure; Philanthropy Fund &lsquo;Innovate Together&rsquo;; Broadened CL&Aacute;R Programme; Comic Relief match funding; Libraries Development- Small Scale Capital Works Programme ; Community Services Programme (CSP) Support Fund; Social Enterprise Funding; Volunteer Support Programme and the COVID-19 Emergency Fund. <\/p><p>The 2021 COVID-19 Stability Fund, launched on Thursday 6th May last is targeted at organisations which deliver critical services to vulnerable people within their community but which now face closure or a loss of service due to the impact of the pandemic. The application window is open, closing on 27<sup>th<\/sup>May 2021. <\/p><p>The recently launched &euro; 4.5 million 2021 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) 2021 will support local groups to re-open their facilities post COVID-19. The application window is open, groups should contact their LCDC for information on making applications. <\/p><p>Groups or organisations qualify for support schemes or programmes provided by my Department where they meet the requisite eligibility criteria. Examples where my Department has provided specific supports, interventions and funding packages for communities throughout the country are as follows:  <\/p><p>- <b>&euro;50 million 2020 support package for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises <\/b>launched by Government and administered by my Department. This funding was made available from the Dormant Accounts Fund through the COVID-19 Stability Fund and the Innovate Together Fund.  <\/p><p>- &euro;4.2 million for 2 rounds of the 2020 <b>COVID-19 Emergency Fund <\/b>which was focused on groups participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative.  <\/p><p><b>- <\/b>&euro;7 million was provided in funding for the <b>Community Enhancement Programme <\/b>in 2020. This comprised of &euro;2 million in June and a further &euro;5 million in August under the Government July Stimulus package.  <\/p><p>- 4.75m<b>Community Services Programme<\/b>, or CSP, 2020 additional support fund, developed by my Department in response to the difficulties being experienced by organisations due to COVID-19, to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll, regardless of whether the organisations are in a position to continue to provide normal activities or whether they have had to close their facilities\/services as a result of the COVID restrictions.  The programme currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme, or CSP, to provide local services through a social enterprise model, in both urban and rural communities. Our 2020 allocation is &euro;46.89m and we achieved full spend in 2020. We have an additional &euro;2m for 2021. Some &euro;49m is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2021. <\/p><p>- My Department worked with Pobal to put in place guidelines for the community and voluntary sector for reopening or operating their premises safely, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>- My Department worked to support the <b>Community Call initiative <\/b>which was an unprecedented mobilisation of both state and voluntary resources to combat the effects of COVID-19. This included providing funding for a COVID-19 Community Outreach initiative implemented by the Wheel and Irish Rural link, which supported the voluntary sector.  <\/p><p>- My Department provided flexibility under the <b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme <\/b>(SICAP 2020, &euro;39.1 million)<b><\/b>to allow Local Development Companies work to support initiatives put in place to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>Other key supports provided by my Department include:<\/p><p>- &euro;6.5 million funding towards the regeneration of <b>Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City <\/b>(NEIC) support in 2020, and the same amount will be available in 2021.  <\/p><p>- &euro;340,000 under the <b>CL&Aacute;R 2020 programme<\/b>through the addition of a new funding measure - Meals on Wheels and Linked Services which placed a particular focus on supporting CL&Aacute;R communities to deal with the impact of COVID-19 in their areas.  <\/p><p>- &euro;5.8 million in funding was approved <b>under CL&Aacute;R 2020 <\/b>for 186 projects. The CL&Aacute;R 2021 budget is increased by 10% to &euro;5.5 million.  <\/p><p>- <b>&euro;1.3 million support for voluntary organisations who provide transport for service <\/b>users in rural areas under the 2020 Mobility and Cancer Care Measure.  <\/p><p>- <b>&euro;25 million under the 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme <\/b>focused on interventions to support the economic and social recovery of our rural towns and villages and assist them in responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. <\/p><p>- I have secured an additional &euro;2 million in Budget 2021 as part of the expanded <b>Town and Village Renewal Scheme<\/b>. <\/p><p>- &euro;20 million, initial allocation in December 2020 for <b>Transitional LEADER Programme <\/b>which will come into effect from 1st. April 2021. A key focus of the Transitional Programme will be on building capacity within communities which have not received LEADER funding to date.  The programme will also support job creation, foster and encourage entrepreneurship, and support projects which address the climate agenda, digital transformation and the Smart Villages approach to building on local strengths and assets. Under the Transitional Programme, the grant rate for enterprises and commercially-focused community projects will be increased from a maximum of 50% to a maximum of 75%.  This will further help to support enterprise development and job creation in rural areas in a post COVID and Brexit environment. <\/p><p>- Based on an analysis of the challenges faced by rural communities and ongoing discussions with stakeholders, the <b>Rural Regeneration and Development Fund<\/b>, third call for Category 1 applications to the Fund which closed in December 2020 had a dual focus - to deliver planned and sustainable regeneration in towns and villages, and to channel investment towards economic recovery in the post Covid-19 environment, providing an immediate stimulus to support the recovery and further development of rural economies and communities.  For similar reasons, changes were also made in relation to the intensity of funding which could be sought from the Fund under this call, with the Fund providing up to 90% of the total project value for successful projects under this call. <\/p><p>- The <b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme<\/b>, or SICAP, is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention. It is a national programme delivered with funding of &euro;190 million over a five-year period from 2018 to 2022. The work in each area differs to support local structures and needs rather than imposing general solutions. It will include work to combat isolation experienced by disadvantaged individuals.  SICAP supports a range of groups in society which are disadvantaged and marginalised.  <\/p><p>- My Department provides <b>support to Local Authorities <\/b>towards the cost of additional staff to support the community function in Local Authorities. These are key posts which continue to support the coordinated Local Community Development Committee arrangements and the implementation of Local Economic and Community Plans in particular monitoring the emerging needs of urban and rural communities throughout the country with a view to responding specifically as required.<\/p><p>In addition my Department has published a number of important policies which will bring tangible benefits to communities throughout the country, including: <\/p><p>- The recently launched <b><i>Our Rural Future<\/i><\/b>, a new whole-of-Government Rural Development Policy for the next five years, which sets out a range of measures to strengthen the resilience of our rural communities and economies, including addressing the impacts of challenges experienced by people living and working in rural Ireland and maximising opportunities for rural areas. <\/p><p>- The development of the <b>National Volunteering Strategy<\/b>provided an opportunity to engage with the sector and the establishment of a National Advisory Group representative of all stakeholders and chaired by the Minister of State, including engagement with our young people through a consultation event with For&oacute;ige. &euro;5.1m is allocated in 2021 to provide support to Volunteer Centres, Volunteering Organisation and to assist with the implementation of the new National Volunteering Strategy 2021-2025.  Supporting the role of volunteers in our society is an important element of my Department&rsquo;s work. <\/p><p>Ongoing dialogue is maintained by my Department with rural and urban stakeholders, in order to identify and respond to issues impacting on individuals and communities.  I will also continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues and will monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities in order to respond to emerging needs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500096#WRMM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1626,"content":"<p>Question No. 576 answered with Question No. 575.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[26239\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021052500096#WRMM01200","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the timescale for decisions on the 2021 community development pilot programme applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1629,"content":"<p>The closing date for receipt of applications for the 2021 Pilot Community Development Programme was Wednesday 31st March.

The recently published &lsquo;Our Rural Future&rsquo;, the new Rural Development Policy, is a clear example of this approach. It is the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural development in Ireland for decades, focusing on sustainability and optimising opportunities for individuals, communities and businesses and it's priorities were directly shaped by the people of rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Its development was informed by an extensive consultation process,  to identify the issues that matter most to people living and working in rural areas. As a result, the policy recognises the needs of rural communities with regards to infrastructure, such as digital connectivity and built environment, and access to services in rural areas. <\/p>  <p>   These consultations included a range of formats and were held with key stakeholders, including Government Departments, State agencies, rural stakeholder groups, young people, and the wider public.<\/p>  <p>  The Department undertook initial stakeholder engagement through three rural development seminars, and eight workshop events around the country (including on the offshore islands) which were well attended by a wide range of stakeholders including Local Authorities, community Garda&iacute;, community and voluntary groups, education and training bodies, sectoral and representative groups and business interests.  In addition, two events were held specifically to obtain the views of young people living in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>   The Department held two further open public consultation events, and I hosted an online public engagement event comprising a panel discussion and a Q&amp;A session.  In addition, an online public survey invited participants to submit their opinions on the challenges and opportunities facing people living and working in rural Ireland.  This survey received 1,733 responses, in which access to public services was identified as one of the major challenges facing rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  All of this engagement was extremely important to inform the priorities contained in Our Rural Future.<\/p>  <p>  The policy was published on 29 March 2021, with a key commitment in its implementation to produce Annual Work Programmes. These work programmes will detail the actions being undertaken across Government each year and associated timelines for delivery.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maximise the impact of Our Rural Future and to maintain communication with rural communities, my Department will be rolling out a range of stakeholder engagement events in 2021, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, including Rural Ideas Fora, a new Rural Youth Assembly, and the establishment of the Higher Education and Research Network.
