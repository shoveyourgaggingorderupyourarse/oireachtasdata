We will be looking at capital projects and if it falls easily under that heading when we come to discuss capital projects, then we will do that.<\/p> <p>  We will also write back on this.  Perhaps we were not specific enough.  We asked for details on the comprehensive appraisal with regard to budgeted projects.  In our letter we also asked for details on how the costs estimations could be improved.  There was a long list of good intentions supplied in the document but they are all in the future.  We want to see timescales.  We will write back seeking specific timescales on the second question.<\/p> <p>  One issue we did not address in our letter to the Secretary General, which I would like be addressed at this stage, is the whole question of value for money, which was not mentioned anywhere in the document.  Perhaps we did not specifically ask this but while it is fine to talk about cost appraisals, we need to know the assessment process as to whether a project meets the value for money criteria, which is a basic requirement for major projects.  We want a detailed note of how that happened and how it is integrated into the approval process for any major projects.<\/p> <p>  We also had clarification on the use of the two-stage contracting process and any derogation from lump sum contracts or common standard contracts since 2011.  There is a list of 12 or 13 items that got a derogation from the lump sum contracts or were two-stage contracting processes.  This will be noted and published.  If anyone wants to follow that up then please do so.  We will come back to this topic as part of our overall look at capital projects.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2087B from Mr. Maurice Quinn provides information requested by the committee regarding expenditure on ships for the Naval Service.  This reply is on foot of correspondence from a member of the public who queried such expenditure in light of perceived issues regarding recruitment.  The Secretary General provides information regarding recruitment in 2018 and so far this year.  We will note and publish that response.  There is a lot of interesting information included about ships being retired that are more than 35 years of age, and other information on the Naval Service being obliged to commission a number of new ships in light of other ships being decommissioned, including on the time it takes to deal with this.  This letter will be noted and published.  It will be of interest to some people.<\/p> <p>  No. 2091B is from Commissioner Mark O'Mahoney at the Tax Appeals Commission, responding to our request for further information regarding appeals that are closed.  The committee had asked for details on those appeals.  The commission points out that the request should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners.  The committee will write to the Revenue Commissioners requesting the details on those cases that were before the Tax Appeals Commission that are either closed or have been withdrawn.  A large amount of money is involved in many of the cases we highlighted.  We are concerned about what was the final outcome for the taxpayer.  We will ask the Revenue Commissioners to give the committee a note on that.  It is up to Revenue to calculate that figure.  The Tax Appeals Commission makes the overall decision but it is up to Revenue to do the sums afterwards.  Am I right in this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I believe that the cases that were closed were settlements between Revenue and the appellant, not determinations of the Tax Appeals Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The cases were, effectively, withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Exactly.

Obviously they will not identify any particular case but if large cases that were before the Tax Appeals Commission have since been closed then it saves work for the Tax Appeals Commission if it does not have to deal with them.  That in its own right is good.  In light of that we will ask the commission to give us an estimate of the value of the cases currently remaining.  We were speaking of &euro;1.6 billion figure at one stage with a potential tax payment &euro;1.1 billion but if a lot of those cases have been disposed of, then some of them may already have been paid or in some cases due refunds.  We will ask the commission to give us an up-to-date figure.  We had asked for the ten most recent or current high-value cases before it but we will now ask for the total quantum of cases currently on its files.  It would be interesting to see if there has been movement on that.<\/p> <p>  No. 2092, received from Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, dated 27 March, relates to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The correspondence contains one very interesting item that people may be surprised to note.  The committee will bring in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and a date has been set for this to be on the work programme, which we will come to in a moment.  In light of the PricewaterhouseCoopers', PwC, report published this week on the cost escalation that will be a very important meeting, and we will also discuss that in due course.<\/p> <p>  The cover note to the document the committee has been given says the correspondence deals with the consideration of the delivery options for phase B of the new children's hospital.  It includes a detailed document that details the options going forward by the HSE.  This was probably dealt with in November of last year before the decision was made by the Government.  The document lists the three options for completing phase B: instruct BAM, the main contractor; instruct a new main contractor; or instruct a management contractor.  The document includes a detailed assessment of the objectives and risks on each of the options.  This document was prepared last autumn and a paragraph on its third page struck me immediately.  It states \"The HSE, at the request of the Department of Health, has sought input from a range of advisors including PwC and Alan Moore (Director of Strategic Capital Development in Northern Ireland), who have met with members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the project delivery team, to inform their views on these questions.\"  It is the first time I have spotted it but perhaps others have seen it before now.  It appears to me that we have a situation where the Department of Health is telling us that PwC was one of its advisers last November or December in the decision on which option to choose.  PwC was also appointed to do the cost escalation report, published in recent days at a cost of approximately &euro;500,000 to the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  The issue of conflict of interest in respect of PwC was raised extensively at the commencement of that process.  They assured us that there was no conflict of interest with regard to BAM, the HSE or the board.  At the time we asked how PwC could be invited to carry out that work without it going through a procurement process at that stage.  They gave us a valid answer that it was already on the list of consultants that could be called on at any time based on a pre-tendering framework.  That is fine but now we see that \"The HSE, at the request of the Department of Health, has sought input from a range of advisors including PwC\".  These are the words of the HSE in relation to this decision.  I want a detailed explanation, immediately and within 24 hours, from the Secretary General.  This story will have to be resolved within 24 hours.  People, including journalists, will be asking how is it that PwC was involved in the decision process looking at how the project would go forward into phase B, and yet was also commissioned to carry out the costs escalation report that was published yesterday.  I do not know how this has arisen.  I am going on the HSE document.<\/p> <p>  This is a separate issue from the Mazars report that was prepared for the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on preliminary observations in relation to the construction capital cost escalation of the national children's hospital, issued on 17 December 2018.  PwC was involved in the process in or around November 2018.  A Mazars report on cost escalation was issued in December.  The HSE then commissioned PwC to do another cost escalation report early this year, at another cost to the taxpayer.  This was all in the process of how the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board arrived at its internal report, dated 28 November 2018, entitled Process to Guaranteed Maximum Price: Working Together for our Children.  We need clarification of the statement by the HSE that PwC were involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I am glad the Chairman raised it.  I did not read the report.  I just glanced at it today and saw that.  I had it marked.  I brought in the report with me.  It is not up for discussion today but I am glad the Chairman raised it because it ties in with the conclusions made.  It seems to me that PwC was never asked to make conclusions.  It was given terms of reference to look at governance and other matters, on which it made recommendations.<\/p><p>On page 8 the word \"conclusion\" jumps off the page.  I wonder about it as I do not see it relating to the terms of reference.  What is particularly interesting is that at the bottom they say, \"At this point, taking any alternative course of action other than continuing would in all likelihood result in significant delay\".  They conclude that one should not go a different route, but that had been decided in the document to which the Chairman referred with input from them at that point.  That is a serious issue.   I agree with the Chairman.  I do not know if that conclusion should be there in the first place but it is a very different forum or may be the next time we discuss it.  Certainly, they are reinforcing what they had apparently said when they gave advice, subject to reading the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00700","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We will ask for clarification of that.

I do not like to be in conflict with the Chairman, who is very fair and very good to us all.  His is a difficult job at times.  I got an opportunity last week to mention that I needed to raise this matter with the Chairman before the meeting.  I put a series of questions on the record that were relevant to the Irish Prison Service.  Off the record, I informed everybody present that I was about to do this.  If people could understand, they would give me a bit of latitude.  I knew we were dealing with the Vote that is primarily of concern to the Department of Justice and Equality but, as often happens, one uses the opportunity if one can to raise some other issues.  It was the first opportunity we had with the Irish Prison Service being before the committee and the response that was given to it in writing on 7 February so I did what I did.  I took legal advice on the framing of questions and explained to the witnesses in advance that while I appreciated that I might not have the relevant expertise or that the relevant line managers were not with us, it would be perfectly fine for those answers to be given in writing after the fact.  We proceeded along those lines.<\/p> <p>  I must put on record a couple of things said by the Chairman.  I do not like to be in conflict with him but as this happened in public session, I would like it to be clarified.  The Chairman stated that they were questions and issues raised by me as one of 13 members of this committee and that it was not a request from the Committee of Public Accounts until such time as the committee agreed to put the questions.  The Chairman later stated that it was not a request from the Committee of Public Accounts, that the committee had not yet decided what questions to put to the witness and that it was a request from one member and was not representative of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Later still, the Chairman stated that the member was not speaking for the committee but was speaking for himself and that it would be up to the committee to decide whether it wanted to put those questions to the witness.<\/p> <p>  That obviously causes a problem.  I am a member of the committee, as nominated by my party and formally selected by the Committee of Selection of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  To the best of my knowledge, and I have taken legal advice, I broke no Standing Order last week and raised no issue regarding parliamentary privilege.  To the best of my knowledge, the committee is the forum and the members ask the questions.  If the committee collectively decides to make a recommendation, that is certainly a committee decision but I know of no Standing Order that requires the unanimous agreement of the other 12 members as to the providence, validity or content of the question of one member, so that is a problem.<\/p><p>Will the Chairman respond to that?  As far as I am concerned, the Prison Service is included in the justice Vote.  While I appreciate that the subject of the meeting was the core justice Vote, digression to other matters relevant to that Department or Vote is reasonable and probably happens at every meeting.  In addition, it may be argued that at least some, if not all, the matters I raised last week could fall under the remit of the internal audit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  In any event, it did not depart from the practice of the past.  Would the Chairman like to retract the unilateral instruction to the witness to the effect that he did not have to answer any questions, and the implication that my questions had to be affirmed, approved or checked by the committee as a whole?  I will reserve my right to petition the Committee on Procedure about the matter.  While I do not wish to be in conflict with the Chairman, the statements are of a serious nature.<\/p><p> I accept that my style of questioning may irk many people, such as fellow Members, the media and witnesses at times, but that is a separate matter which can, as long as I follow the rules, be adjudicated by the people of Sligo-Leitrim in due course.  Nevertheless, the content, questions and quotes I have read directly from the transcript of last week's meeting seemed to undermine severely my position as a member of the committee.  Suggesting that I was effectively a lone soldier who had gone rogue and asked irrelevant, inappropriate questions that required the approval of the other 12 members of the committee went beyond what I believe would be reasonably permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#E02000","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I wish to provide clarification on the serious issues for the benefit of the Deputy.  During the meeting, I listened carefully to his contribution and there was nothing wrong whatsoever with his style.  It was a cogently presented set of remarks and questions.  We can agree everything that was asked related to the remit of the Prison Service.<\/p> <p>  As Chairman, I came to the view that some of the remarks that were made related to behaviour that may have involved criminality.  I felt that it was my duty as the Chairman of a committee, and as an individual, that if remarks relating to potential criminality were highlighted to me, they should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I stated last week that the entire transcript, including the issues raised by the Deputy, needed to be investigated in respect of criminality, such as theft of State property and other items, within the Prison Service.  I stated I would send the transcript to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which I did via the superintendent in Pearse Street, which is the division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which Leinster House is based.  I have carried out, therefore, what I indicated at the meeting that I would.<\/p> <p>  All committees are conducted through the Chairperson.  All questions are put through the Chairperson, who, in turn, puts them to the witnesses.  That is a well-established principle.  To allow for free-flowing meetings, I regularly let people ask and answer questions directly but it is always understood that the questions are put through the Chairperson.  Under Standing Orders, it is the duty of the Chairperson to chair the meeting and all questions are asked through him or her.  When issues were raised by a member with me as Chairman, I made an early judgment that some of the issues involved criminal activity.  I had a simple choice.  I could have put the questions to the Accounting Officer, who would follow them up and revert in due course to the committee, or, if I considered the matters to be very serious, I could decide to put the questions directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its investigation.  I chose the latter option.  Due to the nature of what was said, I felt that it would be more appropriate if some of the remarks were forwarded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its consideration and for any action it may or may not choose to take, rather than ignoring the potential criminality that was highlighted during the meeting and, as if nothing had happened, putting it to the witness as a routine question to be considered.  As will have been seen at every meeting of the committee, members raise issues and ask questions and I invariably ask witnesses to respond directly to the committee in respect of the matter in order that the answer will be conveyed to the rest of the committee.  I make the request on behalf of the committee.  When I say it is a decision of the committee, I am making that decision, as Chairman, on behalf of the committee.  It is not the case that the other members must vet anyone's questions.<\/p> <p>  To clarify the matter, I will read aloud a sentence that I read every morning at every meeting and that I will have to read three times later in the meeting because there are three witnesses.  I state: \"If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.\"  That is the established process in the Oireachtas.  If a witness is directed by a committee to cease giving evidence, he or she must do so.  In practical terms, if the witness is requested to cease giving evidence, the request will be made by the Chairperson on behalf of the committee.  Even though we state the committee can instruct a witness to cease giving evidence, the Chairperson, in fact, issues the instruction on behalf of the committee.  When I stated at the previous meeting that it would be a matter for the committee to decide, I did not intend in any way to imply that members could veto other members' questions.  As I make clear at every meeting, I, as Chairman, will make a ruling on behalf of the committee as to whether questions or answers are appropriate.  I can give a warning accordingly, which is what I did at the previous meeting.  In my role as Chairman, I indicated I was not willing to allow that question to be put through me to an Accounting Officer when, due to the seriousness of the matter, I would convey those questions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for consideration, which is what happened.  Until I, on behalf of the committee, decide that the questions should be put to the Accounting Officer, they will not be.  When I referred to the committee, it reflected the language used in the House.  I refer back to the remarks that I will make three times later in the meeting.  The instruction about the committee potentially asking someone to cease giving evidence means, in practice, that the Chairperson can issue such an instruction.  That is how I interpreted it.  I did not mean the individual members of the committee but rather that if I, as Chairman, wished to conduct a meeting in such a way and decided, on behalf of the committee, that those questions should not be put to the Accounting Officer, I would convey them to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the basis for my decision and I am fully satisfied with the correctness of my approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#F00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I am not satisfied, for a couple of reasons.  There is no issue with sending the transcript to the Garda and, in fact, I support it.  That has nothing to do with it.  The issue of a witness being told to stop giving evidence for fear of having qualified privilege only is also a separate issue.

It may well be there are no issues of criminality.  It was perfectly reasonable to put to the Accounting Officer if he or the Prison Service are aware of A, B, C, D, E, F and G and if not, can they carry out the necessary inquiries.  That was what was on each of my questions, as this will show.<\/p><p> The other implication of what the Chairman is saying is that if it is case that it may end up with criminality being highlighted as a result of some of these questions, that means that in effect he is narrowing the scope of this committee.  What happens if we want to ask questions under the Competition Act, the Criminal Justice Act, the Companies Act, the Health and Safety Act or the Tax Acts, all of which could have implications in criminality?<\/p><p> What happened last week was perfectly within the Chairman&rsquo;s remit.  As I said, I hate to be in any sort of conflict with the Chair.  However, my entitlement as a committee member to put questions to an Accounting Officer was effectively removed.

He said the rules were not broken but then you decided that, although I am full member of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Secretary General and Accounting Officer relevant to this area would not answer these questions.

However, to suggest the Department of Justice and Equality does not have a role is incredible.<\/p><p> If this were to stand as a precedent, we would not be allowed to ask questions in here.  There is the potential for criminality in many of the issues discussed here and in many of the questions put.  Again, I made no accusations against individuals, anybody identifiable or anything like that.  Process, procedures, institutions and the need prudence demands for investigations to be carried out are fine.

That is in order.  The committee will want to review the discussion here today.  If I am wrong on this, the committee can tell me.  However my view, like in my opening comment, is that when witnesses are here, all questions and answers are through the Chair.  There is no vetting by any member of another member's questions.  The Chair has authority to make a ruling that, to put a question to an Accounting Officer, it comes through the Chair or say to an Accounting Officer that he or she will not answer that question.  I have had to say it to Accounting Officers on previous occasions that a question will not be answered on the day.  I have instructed Accounting Officers on previous occasions not to answer a question that a member may have raised but that I felt, as Chairman, was not appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I made the decision on the day as Chairperson, chairing the meeting on behalf of the committee.  It was not the committee that was not putting your questions.  It was me, as Chairman of the committee, acting on behalf of the committee.  I used the reference I read out earlier in relation to witnesses as a parallel.  It was not a direct comparison.  It is an example to show that when we refer to the committee, making a statement about some evidence, which, in practice, it is done by the Chair on behalf of the committee.  It is not all members of the committee have to agree.  In practice, it means the Chair has to do it.  If the Oireachtas&rsquo;s instruction to every committee is that the Chair has no authority to do that unless the full committee makes a decision, that is fine.  If that changes the rules for every Chair of every committee, that is fine.  I will follow that rule.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, the questions, as always, are put through the Chair.  I took my decision as Chair not to allow those questions be put through me to the Accounting Officer.  I made the decision and wanted those questions to be sent to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is what I did.  That is my position.  We have both indicated our positions on it.  I have no problem with some higher committee in this establishment ruling on these matters.  It will not be a matter specific to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It will be a matter relating to the role of all chairmen of all Oireachtas committees.  If clarification is required, I welcome that.  Whatever the outcome of that process is, every other committee Chair and I will take note of that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#G00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>To conclude, I must express regret.

I am joined by several colleagues.  Maria Hurley is assistant director general with responsibility for the corporate affairs directorate, which includes the finance, governance and human resources functions.  Jennifer Banim is assistant director general of the economic statistics directorate.  Richard McMahon is assistant director general of the social and demography directorate.  I propose to briefly outline the role of the Central Statistics Office as well as our strategy and achievements during 2017.  I will also give an overview of the CSO 2017 appropriation account and outline CSO expenditure in 2017.<\/p> <p>  The CSO is Ireland's national statistical institute and is responsible for the production and oversight of the production of all official statistics for Ireland.  The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The role of the director general of the CSO is prescribed in the Statistics Act 1993, which provides that the officeholder acts independently and exercises sole responsibility in professional statistical matters, including statistical methodology, professional standards, timing and content of statistical releases and methods of dissemination.<\/p> <p>  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.  The functions of the CSO, as set out in the Statistics Act, include \"the collection, compilation, extraction and dissemination for statistical purposes of information relating to economic, social and general activities and conditions in the State.\"  This mandate was broadened under EU Regulation No. 223\/2009, which makes the CSO director general responsible for the co-ordination and oversight of the quality of all European official statistics compiled by public authorities in Ireland.  Confidence in the quality and independence of official statistics is crucial as this information serves as an objective input to policy development, oversight and governance at national and international levels.<\/p> <p>  Under EU regulation, each member state was invited to commit to improve or maintain the conditions for the implementation of the European statistics code of practice via a commitment on confidence.  In May 2017, the Government adopted a commitment on confidence in statistics.  In signing this declaration, the Government reaffirmed the CSO's independence, impartiality and commitment to quality.<\/p> <p>  From a governance and planning perspective, good policies start with good data.  Good data are the lifeblood of decision-making and the basis for accountability.  The role of the CSO is to make sense of data by providing high quality statistics, independent insight and information for effective debate and decision-making across government, business and society.  The work we do creates good quality statistics that help people to understand the changes taking place in Ireland's economy and society.<\/p> <p>  The key deliverables and objectives for the CSO are informed by national and European policy.  The CSO delivers a demanding and growing statistical work programme each year.  In 2017, a total of 345 electronic releases and publications were published, including 13 outputs on census 2016.  We are currently preparing for the next census in 2021.  In addition to electronic releases and publications, the CSO transmits data to EUROSTAT, the Central Bank, the European Central Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Health Organization, among others.<\/p> <p>  The European statistical system has a significant impact on the work of the CSO.  Approximately 73% of the statistics we produced in 2017 were required under EU statistical legislation.  The CSO is an active member of the European statistical system and is centrally involved in key committees and executive bodies across a range of domains.<\/p> <p>  We delivered across all our strategic aims in 2017.  Alongside our 2017 statistical work programme, we completed the census 2016 project during 2017, producing some new style results publications and more than 30 individual infographics to support the communication of key releases.  We published the first estimate of GNI*.  This is a modified indicator of the overall size or level of the economy.  We also published a modified total domestic demand indicator that focuses on activity within the Irish economy.  This is designed to exclude significant globalisation effects that disproportionately affect the Irish economic results.<\/p> <p>  We established the Irish statistical system co-ordination directorate, which is leading on key strategic issues such as the development of the national data infrastructure and the co-ordination of professional statistical services to the broader Irish public system.  We continued to explore the use of secondary and blended data sources to compile new analysis, progressing the evolution of official statistics through the use of emerging data resources while focusing on burden reduction for respondents.<\/p><p>We introduced a more cost-effective data collection methodology in our household survey domain, namely, computer assisted telephone interviewing, which has afforded respondents a greater degree of flexibility in the manner in which they engage with the office and support our field force in concentrating its efforts on respondent recruitment in an environment of persistently falling response rates. <\/p><p> The CSO ran the Civil Service employee engagement survey in 2017, which operated across the entire Civil Service under action 25 of the Civil Service renewal plan and provided important insights into the experiences and opinions of those working in the Civil Service.  The results were compiled by the office before being supplied to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for analysis and publication and the resulting outputs were used to inform further development towards the reform of the Civil Service.  We capitalised on new approaches to communication and user engagement by developing a new style of infographic and developing user applications on Brexit, house prices and the consumer price index among others.  <\/p><p> The CSO also improved access to data for researchers by launching a remote access to microdata solution for researchers in 2017, significantly improving data security.  From an internal statistical quality perspective, during 2017 the CSO continued its investment in the new quality and methodology support function, headed by a senior statistician and tasked with underpinning the CSO's efforts to consistently refine its approach to quality management in official statistics and its commitment to continuous methodological improvement.  Overall, 2017 was a year of transition for the CSO, maintaining the historic focus on the systematic production of key economic and social indicators, while striving to broaden the focus and reach of official statistics to a more mainstream audience in response to the public demand for access to impartial and high-quality data to inform evaluation and decision making. <\/p><p> The net outturn for the CSO in 2017 was &euro;44.727 million against an estimate provision of &euro;48.584 million.  This lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in a surrender of &euro;3.856 million back to the Exchequer at the end of December 2017.  The bulk of the saving related to expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances that are payable to permanent staff assigned to the office.  The 2017 appropriation account was audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p> I will briefly outline the office&rsquo;s expenditure in 2017.  First, with respect to salaries, the bulk of the office's expenditure is expended on salaries, wages and allowances that are paid to permanent staff assigned to the CSO.  In 2017, this expenditure amounted to &euro;36.080 million against an estimate of &euro;38.983 million.  Savings of &euro;2.903 million were realised.  The estimate allocation was based on staff numbers of 755 but the actual number serving throughout the year was lower at 736.  This was mainly due to difficulties and delays in the filling of vacancies at statistician level and in IT technical grades during the year. <\/p><p> With respect to other non-pay, in line with other Votes, the CSO has several non-pay administrative subheads: A(ii) travel and subsistence; A(iii) training and development and incidental expenses; A(iv) postal and telecommunications services; A(v) office equipment and external IT services; A(vi) office premises expenses; A(vii) consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews; and A(viii) collection of statistics.  Non-pay administrative expenditure of the office in 2017 amounted to &euro;10.189 million against an estimate of &euro;10.989 million.  Savings of &euro;800,000 were returned to the Exchequer.   The detail of this expenditure is set out in appendix A, which has been circulated to the committee. <\/p><p> Our strategic goals were captured in our statement of strategy 2016 to 2019, which was published in late 2016.  In this, we said that we aim to turn data and statistics into information and knowledge for all; to increase the use of secondary data sources; to continue to build the capacity of our people; to modernise our statistical processes and systems, and to co-ordinate, oversee and assure the quality of all official statistics produced in Ireland.  The CSO is operating in an increasingly challenging environment.  We are experiencing growing user demand, both nationally and from Europe, where EUROSTAT and the European Central Bank are the two main sources.  The CSO is increasingly being asked to take on new survey work or to incorporate existing studies into its programme of official statistics, as can be seen by the recent announcement to embed the Growing Up in Ireland survey from 2023 and the decision to task the CSO with conducting a new sexual violence survey, a modern successor to the 2002 SAVI report.  <\/p><p> The complexity of the world we are trying to measure is also increasing with emerging issues such as globalisation and digitalisation, which result in complex economic transactions necessitating sophisticated analysis to decipher.  We are experiencing transformational change in the range and complexity of the data sources available to describe our economy and our society.  We are witnessing the use of statistics and data by a growing variety of stakeholders, sometimes with agenda-driven emphasis.  We are experiencing growing levels of scrutiny of data to ascertain its reliability, accuracy and veracity.  In this environment, the CSO is responding by maintaining a focus on its important heritage of impartiality and objectivity in the formulation of transparently produced, accurate and reliable official statistics, while exploring the boundaries of technology, data sources and statistical methods and techniques to persistently enhance the quality and insight afforded by our outputs.  To do this, we are committed to building an innovative, agile and high-performing organisation to fully exploit the potential of the data and technological revolutions.  Our aim is to deliver a broader range of high-quality information on societal and economic change for Ireland, which is demonstrably independent and without bias, and which can withstand scrutiny as regards data sources, statistical methodology and the impartiality of its compilers.  In so doing, we can support the process of guiding Ireland&rsquo;s future development for the benefit of all our citizens.  That concludes my statement.  I thank the members for their attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions they have to offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dalton for that.

There were issues with classification of certain crimes.  Some crimes were not classified in the right category.  There were some cases where crimes were not captured on PULSE at all.  There were some duplication issues.  There was no clarity on the application of the crime recording rules.  The crime recording rules effectively constitute a manual that provides absolute clarity.  They are supposed to provide clarity on how any particular crime is supposed to be accounted for in a recorded crime system like PULSE.  Obviously, they have these crime recording rules in other jurisdictions.  We are working continuously with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to try to improve the quality of its data for its purposes first of all because it needs good quality data from PULSE for its own reasons.  Then we would become downstream beneficiaries.  One of the things we are working on in particular involves the crime recording rules.  We are trying to encourage them and we will work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop this crime recording rules document.<\/p> <p>  There are two other things we want An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do.  We want it to introduce a formal quality management framework.  The quality division in the CSO has met An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explain what the quality management framework would be like and to outline how it might go about improving the quality of the data on PULSE over time.  Finally, we really feel it is important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appoints a single person at a very senior level to take point on data-related issues.  At the minute, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an interim chief data officer.  I think the intention is make that a permanent post.  This is incredibly important for us but it is important that this role be at a very senior level in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the person can influence the development and the move towards improving crime data.  <\/p> <p>  Under reservation is a term used by EUROSTAT for government finance statistics.  If EUROSTAT has a concern about a country's government finance statistics, it can put this reservation on the data.  What it effectively means is that there are concerns about the data and EUROSTAT cannot fully stand over the data.  We were left in this situation where there was a vacuum.  Our concern is that vacuums normally get filled with anecdotal information or poor quality or subjective data.  The longer a vacuum is left, the greater the risk that this occurs so we took the decision to resume publication but we needed to be clear with users that there was an issue with the data.  That is why we put in the classification \"Under Reservation\".<\/p> <p>  What we have also done to help users is produce three quality reports on the data coming from PULSE.  We try to give a clear signal to users that the figures on a certain classification coming from PULSE may well be an understatement, for example, burglaries.  We give a clear statement in the quality report as to our assessment of the accuracy of the particular statistic on whichever part or type of crime it is.  We could have left a vacuum and said we were not going to publish but we felt transparency was important.

In broad terms, it is important to understand that more than half of our medium-term vacancies relate to specialist technology posts.  One of the greatest difficulties we have had in this regard concerns the lack of availability of panels of staff ready to be appointed and the necessity, in some cases, to run tailored competitions.<\/p> <p>  On the statistical side, we run statistical competitions every year.  It happened last year that our full panel of statisticians was exhausted by the autumn.  Therefore, it is only vacancies that have crystallised on the statistical side since the autumn that continue into to this year.  Added to that, it is important to note that, because we supply statisticians for secondment to the wider statistical system, we have a constant catalogue of requests coming in for statisticians to send on secondment.  That has also created backlogs.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the other dimension, concerning risk management and the extent to which we engage with staff, whether it be through the Civil Service employee engagement survey, CSEES, or other channels, we have already published our action plan further to the CSEES survey.  The action plan was developed in consultation with colleagues from across the organisation.  There are now active working groups considering what actions are required to give effect to the objectives set out in the action plan.  A key channel in the delivery of those actions is our engagement and innovation board, which is a long-standing structure in the CSO.  It is a cross-staffing grade structure specifically targeted at affording a discussion forum for matters affecting staff in all areas of the business, both statistical and administrative.<\/p> <p>  The engagement and innovation board is just one of the forums we use to engage with staff.  We have grade-based forums, a senior management group forum, a general management form, and grade-based forms for all the administrative grades.  At present, we are in the process of completing a significant round of consultations in the preparation of the CSO people strategy to take us forward for the next several years in respect of the supports we are putting in place to develop our staff in terms of their technical skills and aptitude to deliver the supports required for the business and also to enable them to fulfil their full potential.  I will follow up in writing with further detail, as the Deputy requested.  I hope, however, my answer gives some illustration of the extensive variety of consultations and forums that are available to enable the flow of information in both directions across the entire organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#R02400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Hurley"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses.

Legally, the office is part of the Civil Service and is funded through Vote 8.  As the Constitution requires that I must audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, specific arrangements have to be put in place to facilitate this being done in an independent fashion.<\/p> <p>  First, it should be noted that Ms Drinan, as secretary, is the administrative head of the office, with responsibility for operations and ensuring good value delivery of the service.  This is in addition to her responsibility as a director of audit for delivery of a portfolio of audits and reports.  As Accounting Officer, she controls the annual Estimate and the office&rsquo;s spending, and is responsible for submitting the appropriation account.<\/p> <p>  Second, I appoint a competitively procured, private sector auditor to carry out the audit of the appropriation account on my behalf, and to report to me on the results of the audit.  The contract for the audit is currently with Mazars.  The objective of the audit is the same as for all other appropriation account audits and the audit approach is similar to that carried out by my office for all other Votes.  I rely on the certificate and report of Mazars as the basis for presentation of my own certificate, and the auditor&rsquo;s certificate is presented with my own to the Oireachtas.  Consequently, I am accompanied for this session by Mr. Bernard Barron, a partner at Mazars, who leads the audit for the company. <\/p> <p>  Due to the requirement under auditing standards to rotate responsibility for particular audits, I appointed Ms Drinan to her current portfolio in January of this year.  She replaced Mr. Harkness on that portfolio, and also as secretary of the office and as Accounting Officer.  Mr. Harkness had fulfilled that role for just over six years and members will note that he signed off on the 2017 appropriation account.  He, too, is in attendance.<\/p> <p>  The office&rsquo;s appropriation account records gross expenditure of &euro;11.9 million in 2017, representing an increase of around 3% on the 2016 expenditure.  The bulk of the expenditure each year is on salaries.  Non-Exchequer receipts into the Vote amounted to just under &euro;6 million in 2017.  This mainly comprised receipts of fees charged by the office for non-Vote financial audits carried out by the office.  The office&rsquo;s policy, as agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is full recovery of the costs incurred on non-Vote audits over a three-year cycle.  Fees are not charged for Vote audits or audits of the finance and Revenue accounts, or in respect of any reporting work undertaken.  As a result of the recovery of fees and some other appropriations-in-aid, the net expenditure on the Vote in 2017 was just under &euro;6 million.  The surplus for surrender at the year end was &euro;978,000.  I am glad to report that the office received a clear audit opinion and there were no matters arising from the audit that I or Mazars considered required reporting to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and call Ms Drinan to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#S00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee for the invitation to appear before it.

In his opening statement, the Comptroller and Auditor General set out the distinction between his constitutional role and the role of the office, and my role as Accounting Officer.  When I became Accounting Officer in January, I took on responsibility for the administrative operations of the office.  As such, I am responsible for ensuring that adequate financial management and internal control systems are in place to support the proper administration of the office in an economical and efficient manner. <\/p> <p>  The office&rsquo;s approved staff complement is 178.  As at 31 March 2019, the office had 159 full-time equivalent members of staff and 19 vacancies.  We have recently completed a trainee auditor recruitment process, resulting in a panel of 29, and consequently the number of vacancies is expected to be reduced significantly in the coming weeks.  The current staff are distributed across three functional areas.  Nearly three quarters of the staff work on financial audit, 15% work on examination reporting, while 12% work on support services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Drinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>What does Ms Drinan mean by examination reporting?

It is performance audit.<\/p><p>Financial audit involves the annual financial audits of almost 290 clients.  All financial audit staff from the auditor grade upwards are qualified accountants.  Audits are carried out in accordance with international standards on auditing.  To manage peaks in demand during the calendar year the office contracts out a number of these financial audits annually.  A key objective of the office is to advance the timeliness of the completion of financial audits.  The committee will be aware of the progress made on this over recent years.  At the end of 2018, eight sets of financial statements relating to 2017 or earlier years had not been certified.  This compares with 13 arrears for 2017.<\/p><p> The output of the reporting programme comprises the report on the accounts of the public services, which issues at the end of September each year, and special reports.  In 2018, a total of 29 reports were issued.  This was made up of 22 chapters in the report on the accounts of the public services and seven special reports.  The figure compares with 26 reports issued in 2017, made up of 24 chapters and two special reports.<\/p><p> Support services comprise a number of business units covering human resources, finance, information technology, good practice, business improvement, training and development and corporate services.<\/p><p> I will now set out the financial position.  In 2017, the office operated an administrative gross budget of &euro;12.64 million, nearly 82% of which was allocated to salaries.  During 2017, actual expenditure was approximately &euro;11.9 million, which was &euro;720,000 or 6% below budget.  This was primarily due to savings of approximately &euro;500,000 in salaries.  There was a further saving of &euro;291,000 in subhead A7 because our requirement for external assistance for examinations was less than budgeted for.<\/p><p> On the receipts side, audit fee income was up by over &euro;300,000, reflecting the earlier completion of the audit programme.  This trend continued in 2018.  The savings in salaries have arisen mainly due to turnover of staff and the carrying of unfilled vacancies.  Vacancies arise due to staff departing and due to an increase in the overall staff complement in recent years.  There is currently a shortage of qualified accountants in the Irish market as a result of the recovery in the economy.  This has created a demand for experienced accountants and we see the impact of this on our turnover rates.  We recruit actively.  In the past three years we have made 125 staff appointments, including 64 recruits at entry level.  The environment continues to be challenging and we keep this issue under constant review.<\/p><p> This is a brief overview of the office and its work.

It is also of the utmost importance that these critically ill babies are cared for close to their mothers during the most vulnerable period of their lives and that mothers are not kept apart from their sick babies, stressed and worried on the post-natal wards of maternity hospitals in different parts of the city.  I hope, by coming here today, that the committee will strongly recommend that the best interests of these critically ill babies, who have mortality rates between 5% and almost 20%, are addressed as a matter of priority for financial reasons, as this is the Committee of Public Accounts, but also, more importantly, for medical and compassionate reasons.  If we are building the most expensive hospital in the world, these babies need to be looked after.<br\/><br\/>By way of background, in November 2012, the then Minister for Health and current Senator, Dr. James Reilly, announced that the national paediatric hospital was to be developed on the current site at St. James's Hospital.  There was no reference to when a maternity hospital might be built although there was an aspiration to do so.  In October 2014, the then Minister for Health and current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, suggested that a planning application be submitted for a maternity hospital alongside the children's hospital.  This was not done.<br\/><br\/>A document supplied by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to the Committee of Public Accounts in January states, in reference to St. James's, that it is not known when or if it is certain that a maternity building will be constructed.  It is also of note that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's PowerPoint presentation to the Committee of Public Accounts on 31 January last contained not a single reference to maternity co-location.  It is fair to state that there is widespread scepticism that maternity co-location will happen unless it starts soon.<br\/><br\/>Why come before the Committee on Pubic Accounts?  The State is building the most expensive hospital in the world, namely, the national children's hospital.  It is intended that a maternity hospital will be built beside it in the interests of critically ill babies.  If a maternity hospital can never be built on this site or if, when the national children's hospital is built, there is simply no room left for such a facility, then the State will have built the most expensive hospital in the world on the wrong site.  This would be both a financial and medical catastrophe.<br\/><br\/>Although PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, did not mention it, it should also be noted that the original cost estimates for the development of the national children's hospital, including a basement car park as cited by St. James's Hospital in April 2012 to the all important Dolphin review, was &euro;297.75 million.  In the same submission, it was also stated that, &quot;The site proposed has very limited decanting requirements and thereby prompt access to site for development commencement (&amp;lt; 6 months).&quot;<font color=\"#4F4F4F\">  <\/font>Importantly, this proposal also contained a co-located maternity hospital of 42,000 sq. m.<br\/><br\/>There are certainly issues of concern as to how back-of-the-envelope financial calculations, assertions about easy site clearance and the availability of a very generous footprint for a maternity hospital, which seems to have evaporated, became the shaky foundations for the construction of the most expensive hospital in the world, the national children's hospital.  Added to this remains the intrigue surrounding reports in the media of a last-minute switch of sites by the Government.  Lessons also need to be learned from this.  With projected costs in excess of &euro;1.73 billion, a completion date now reset at 2023 and no sign of a co-located maternity hospital, the committee will agree that there is a need to think more carefully about what we are doing on this site, not just continuing blindly as though there are not very serious issues to deal with and not just believing everything that we are being told.<br\/><br\/>As I see it, there are two options for the current crisis relating to funding and maternity co-location.  One is to stop the current development and relocate to Connolly Hospital.  The advantages of Connolly Hospital are well known when it comes to construction methodology, space, nationwide access and the opportunity to co-locate the Rotunda Hospital.  The analysis of this option, however, must take into consideration the money spent, or lost, on the St. James's site to date, expenditure on the satellite centre at Connolly, estimated contractual liabilities and legal costs resulting from stopping the development of St. James's Hospital and the need to significantly upgrade the adult services in Connolly to the levels of St. James's Hospital, the Mater Hospital or St. Vincent's University Hospital to support the co-location of a maternity hospital and paediatric hospital.  That would be an enormous strategic and financial undertaking, which is often not factored into the equation, and also the long delay that would happen in that case.<br\/><br\/>At a pragmatic level, the project at St. James's Hospital, the site of which I visited last night, is probably past its tipping point.  In addition, there appears to be limited public support to stop and start again for the third time.  The political consequences of changing the site are considerable.  There are certainly no votes in stopping this building.<br\/><br\/>The other option is to continue with the development on the current site.  This should only continue if there is evidence that the overall projected costs can be properly estimated and are affordable; in other words, that there are no unknown unknowns, that the proper governance and cost control structures are put in place and that the recommendations of the PwC report are implemented.  The overall cost must also include a maternity hospital, which should have been included from the start and the current site must be stress tested, in the same way that PwC stress tested the finances, to ensure that it can accommodate a maternity hospital, the Coombe, and that the co-location of the latter is, in accordance with Government policy, now prioritised among other planned projects on a very busy St. James's Hospital site and included in the national capital plan, with a short timeline for delivery and ring-fenced funding.  It is of note now that St. James's Hospital is planning to build a cancer hospital.<\/p><p>This is a site that does not stand still, it is the busiest hospital in the State.  It needs to be prioritised that a maternity hospital is developed on this site if it is to happen at all.<\/p><p> Taking all this into consideration, I propose that this co-location of the maternity service on the St. James's campus be accelerated while, at the same, time fulfilling the ambitions of the national women and infants healthcare programme run by the HSE and Department of Health in respect of women's healthcare needs.  This proposal involves the transfer of maternity services only from the Coombe to St. James's Hospital.  The Coombe Hospital caters for both gynaecology services and maternity services.  It has the largest gynaecology service in the State.  It exists on 5.5 acres or 17,500 m2.  The site currently earmarked for the maternity hospital at St. James's is 3 acres, so there is an issue about fitting onto the site.  The way I propose that this be done is to move the maternity service but to retain the large gynaecology service on its current site in the context of an integrated campus.  This would allow the development of a benign gynaecology services as well as the national cervical screening laboratory services on the present Coombe site.  Any investment in that site would be future-proofed.  The reconfiguration of the services would also liberate space on the site which could be used to fund the co-location.<\/p><p> This would result in a faster tri-location, for less and on a smaller footprint and with considerably less campus disruption.  I will not give ballpark figures or back-of-the-envelope calculations but this would cost a minimal amount in comparison with the amount that has been squandered on the St. James's Hospital site.  This would develop an integrated campus across two sites.<\/p><p> Over the past week, \"Liveline\" has heard how the maternity services over the years have failed mothers and babies, how clinicians have failed at times to listen and to act with compassion and how things need to improve.  I am not sure what it takes for politicians to also listen and make decisions based on medical evidence and compassion as well as economics.  We do not want to be told in years to come how when we had the chance to do what was right, that we failed to respond to the critical needs of the most vulnerable children in the State and their mothers.  This is not a legacy that any Government or supply party in opposition in a confidence and supply agreement would want to leave behind.  <\/p><p> Critically ill babies should not be made to suffer because of poor decision-making at the start of this project and reckless spending since it commenced.  In the end, we bailed out the banks.  Babies and children are far more important than banks.  We need to bail out this hospital.  We need to build a maternity hospital as quickly as possible.  If that means going to the European Investment Bank, EIB, for another extension on a loan, so be it.  We also need to learn from our mistakes, including the mistakes that were made by the Dolphin review and that were made at the origin of this decision.  We must take account of our actions.  This is now a beleaguered project and we need to rediscover the vision that inspired us to bring three different types of hospitals together and to make it into a truly world-class centre.  There is no option but to make it work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#MM01500","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fitzpatrick.

Those who object to the site do so for many reasons.  The key objection at the present time relates to the absence of maternity co-location.  Other reasons are cited including cost, nationwide access, expansion capability and space, but the key issue is the absence of a maternity hospital co-location.  That is what will stop it being a world-class centre.  My argument is that if we are building the most expensive hospital in the world, and calling it a centre of excellence, and if it is going to be a world-class hospital, it should not exclude those babies who have the highest mortality rates, the children who need to have access to this.<\/p> <p>  The other issue in respect of Connolly Hospital is its range of specialty expertise in the context of its academic prowess.  St. James's Hospital, the Mater and St. Vincent's Hospital are at a different level in the support they would provide to a co-locating maternity hospital, and to a co-locating paediatric hospital.  Academically, and in terms of its medical specialties, St. James's hospital is the right site.  There was no ideal site for this.  We put in a proposal which was short-listed to the final three.  It was an imaginative proposal but the decision has been made.  There were flaws in how that decision was made but the one issue that will convert much of the angst, frustration and criticism of this site is to somehow ascertain whether it can accommodate a maternity hospital, which I believe it can.  There is a way of establishing flexible arrangements between the Coombe and St. James's Hospital can be achieved, and we should go ahead and do it.  Everyone would row in behind that.<\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of criticism of the project and the wow factor that should pertain to this hospital has been lost.  It needs to be rediscovered and we need to work together to make it happen.  My concern is that St. James's Hospital is a busy site academically and clinically.  It is fanciful to think that a space can be held or sterilised for five or ten years and then made available.  I am also concerned that if it goes on for years, some 200 babies annually will not have access to this hospital.  This figure will increase with increasing pre-natal diagnosis.  The Coombe is also seeing referrals from the North of Ireland.  This hospital will have a referral basis from the whole island of Ireland.  A lot of babies will lose out on this.  We need to get the co-location.  People are looking at the finances but somebody needs to look at the site and reassure everyone the maternity hospital will go in there.  It should be put in the capital plan with the design started now, whether it is done back-to-back or some works can be started in advance, but it should be prioritised in relation to St. James Hospital and the capital plan.  It currently exists nowhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#NN00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Professor Fitzpatrick mentioned the St. James's site and the building of a cancer centre or hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#NN00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>My understanding is that plans are being made to develop a cancer hospital at the St. James's site.  According to an <i>Irish Times <\/i>editorial, there is a need to address cancer issues in the hospital, which is the largest cancer hospital in the State.  That site has a maximum capacity.  What one would not want to happen is that in 2023, when the doors of the new paediatric hospital open, that there will be no space for a maternity hospital.  That is why I believe the space should be identified, along with planning, decanting and demolition issues, and that process should start now.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Health, asked for a planning application to be submitted at the same time for the children's hospital and the maternity hospital.  I am not certain why that did not happen.  It may have been because after the Mater site had failed planning, that were it made any more complex, it could fail planning again but it is time to grasp the nettle.  There is a total lack of credibility and trust on this.  Those of us who work on the front line in relation to babies feel that we have been sidelined regarding the patients whom we feel are important.<br\/><br\/>There is a way of dealing with this.  It is too late to stop the project.  Academically and in terms of the specialties, St. James's is the best place and we must make it work.  Regarding the space available and what it would entail in co-locating onto that site, flexibility could be put into place that would allow this to happen sooner rather than later.  The message needs to go out to all those who genuinely object to the site because of the absence of co-location that this is now a Government priority.<br\/><br\/>I am reluctant to throw out figures because I have seen back-of-the-envelope calculations before which were widely out of range.

Our paths have crossed and I alerted the committee that we know each other to an extent.  I thank Professor Fitzpatrick for the time he served as master of the Coombe hospital.  It is something people do and it is not often recognised.  It is a very important role and I have told the health committee previously that I am a big fan of the mastership model of care.  Professor Fitzpatrick will know that I have experience of having a child in a Dublin hospital who had to be transferred for the reasons Professor Fitzpatrick outlined.  The child was taken from me at birth and brought to Crumlin hospital.  That is not much of an effort when one is in Dublin and people might say, \"what about it?\".  However, Professor Fitzpatrick knows the risks involved in such transfers as well as the knock-on effects of having a child, handing it over to somebody else in a different hospital and being left alone.  It is not something people think about until they are in that situation.  The figures are stark that in that transfer period bad things can happen and children's lives are lost.<\/p> <p>  Before becoming involved in politics I was initially not in favour of the St. James's site but I bought into the idea based on the concept of the tri-location of an adult hospital, a paediatric hospital and a maternity hospital on the same site, supported by the sub-specialties Professor Fitzpatrick has discussed.  My argument for supporting the site diminishes, however, if there is no chance of a maternity hospital on site.  It is critical that a maternity hospital be on the site and I thank Professor Fitzpatrick for his clear argument today that it must happen and that it must start now so it is ready and fit for purpose as well as ticking the boxes for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and all that was planned from the start.  It is not the right site if there is no maternity hospital because that was one of the fundamental reasons for putting it there.<\/p> <p>  The cancer unit on the site concerns me.  In St. James's Hospital and through the cancer strategy we have very good survival rates for cancer now, and I will be discussing this later in the D&aacute;il.  If there is a space there for the cancer unit does Professor Fitzpatrick think it could be put somewhere else?  If he were to juggle the cancer unit and the maternity hospital, he appears to be saying today that the maternity hospital should get priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#OO00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I am not certain about where at the St. James's Hospital site the cancer hospital is going.  I would not wish to second guess or somehow inhibit the development of cancer services in St. James's Hospital.  I am a patient in St. James's Hospital as well, where I am very well looked after.  I believe it is possible to do all these things.  St. James's Hospital has a can do attitude.  It does things and is a very ambitious hospital.  I am saying that in that ambition we must make certain that there is a protected space, and the way to protect the space is to start doing something about it now and not to wait.  Basically, it would be a travesty of everything that has happened in this regard to find out a couple of years hence that we could not get planning for a hospital that should have been built at the start.  The flawed decision was not to put in a dual application at the start and have a co-build.  I believe we should examine how the fastest build can be achieved, what the site is, what the specification is and issues regarding access, but this work should start now.  The work must be funded because obviously we require experts to help us with it.  That process can start.<\/p> <p>  In terms of neonatal transport, we have a wonderful neonatal transport service.  However, it is recognised that babies decompensate during transport.  Certainly, the model of care that is recommended by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is that babies who have critical illnesses and pre-identified problems and who need to be transferred to a paediatric hospital ideally should go across a corridor rather than in an ambulance.  The term \"world class\" has often been bandied about in regard to this hospital, as well as its expense.  It behoves us to do it right and not find ourselves short changed.  Much of the criticism regarding this site relates to the absence of maternity co-location and a disbelief and lack of trust that it might happen.  I was speaking about this in 2006, 2012 and subsequently, but nothing has happened.  It is time to act.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the Committee of Public Accounts can recommend or what authority it has in this regard.  I appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health previously and I should have walked out asking for something.  I am asking for the strongest recommendation that the Committee of Public Accounts can give to accelerate the co-location of a maternity hospital on the St. James's Hospital site.  That would mean it would have been worthwhile for me to have appeared before the committee in that regard.  I do not know whether that is possible.  I like the consensus politics we have here at present when one considers what is happening abroad, and I believe there is a consensus on the fact that there is a need for a maternity hospital there.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the site, if we were to do it all again we might do it differently, but we are where we are on this.  I believe people want to work together and that they will contribute.  I will contribute whatever I can to it.  I have been critical of this for a long period of time.  Medicine is like politics in that one gets things done through compromise.  We must compromise on this and consider what the important thing is, which is a maternity hospital on that site.  If the committee can do anything to get it there quickly, I would be very grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#OO00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":549,"content":"<p>One could argue that it is not a world class hospital if the maternity hospital is not on site, in terms of the spend.

I am also a member of the health committee.  We have the maternity strategy and I am aware that Professor Fitzpatrick and many of his colleagues had an input into that.  One of the criticisms of the maternity strategy was that it separated obstetrics and gynaecology.  It is the separation of having babies and just being a woman, in layman's terms.  There are many Cinderellas in politics but gynaecology, as we have seen from the massive waiting lists, is often a Cinderella because women will put up with things where other people would not.  In terms of Professor Fitzpatrick's idea of leaving gynaecology in the Coombe and moving births onto the St. James's site, I am concerned that we would have a clinic or a building that might not be fit for purpose.

I do not believe so.  The issue with benign gynaecology is that it is deprioritised in the general hospitals.  It is very difficult.  A percentage of women with symptoms that are suggestive of benign disease will actually have an occult cancer.  Where women have, for example, problems with menstrual dysfunction and are on a waiting list to go into a maternity hospital or a general hospital, unfortunately a small percentage of them may change from pre-cancer conditions to cancer conditions because there is such a long delay in evaluating them, which is a tragedy.  The issue is the model of care we need for gynaecology care.  I am looking at the development of an integrated campus.  It is not that what would happen in the Coombe would be very different from what happens in St. James's.  The distance between our hospital and St. James's Hospital is less than the distance across St. James's Hospital.  Our vision is that over time this part of Dublin, and a great deal of spin-off development will happen with the paediatric hospital coming into it, will be a medical quarter and over 20 to 40 years both hospitals will grow together.<\/p> <p>  There are governance issues to be addressed, but the main thing is to focus on patient outcomes, quality of care, access and choice.  There is a wonderful opportunity to develop a customised gynaecology centre, an ambulatory centre, where women would have a range of treatments that are very difficult to access now.  The Coombe hospital currently has a submission with the HSE to develop a new day care centre to cater for all women's reproductive needs, in terms of a one-stop-shop with en suite scanning and so forth and procedures on the day of presentation.<\/p><p>That is a wonderful model.  It does not necessarily sit well in a cancer hospital.  The spatial organisation of a hospital has to be flexible and allow for a configuration of services in the right spaces.  Regarding space, if we moved our maternity hospital to St. James's Hospital, we would retain our gynaecology services as an integrated service across both sites.  What is currently needed in Dublin and in our hospital group network is ready access to day-case, ambulatory and short-stay gynaecology surgery.  Not only would that be possible in St. James's Hospital, it could be integrated with what is happening in Tallaght University Hospital, Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise and Naas General Hospital.  That would allow a network of care, not segregated but integrated.<\/p><p> I have seen issues around staff flexibility, concerning new contracts for nurses and midwives and how people work across sites.  I would like the Committee of Public Accounts and the Government to give impetus to prioritising the development of women's healthcare services and the co-location of a maternity hospital on the site of St. James's Hospital.  I am concerned with space, money, and providing the best possible access.  We can be flexible in how we could do that.

The vision was that the whole campus would work as a single campus.  I am concerned with what works.  The really important thing is to start to make it happen.  These are the questions we need to ask.  We need support from HSE estates and we need a design team.  We need to start planning this hospital now.  I have asked whether work could be done in advance, simultaneously to what is happening in the national children's hospital or back-to-back, but this needs to happen.  There must be a very strong message from the Government saying that the money will be found.  The problem with the overspend is that it will hit lots of things that are on the list to be done.  It could affect the co-location of the Coombe and St. James's Hospital.  Things are going to be cut because of the money lost in the national children's hospital project, and that is one of them.  That would be regrettable.  It would fulfil Deputy O'Connell's worst fears in that this would not end up being the hospital we planned.

Acquiring the national children's hospital would bring such kudos and status to a hospital that it would become the de facto national adult hospital.  There are several issues.  We were emerging from a recession so perhaps money was an issue.  The decision was made after a failed planning application to build on the Mater Hospital site.  Members may remember the visual imagery.  It was a very imaginative, almost surreal hospital in terms of magnitude.  When this was played out for a second time six years later, there was a fear that if the proposal for the St. James's Hospital site was overly complex it might fail to get planning permission.

From our point of view, they are the children with the greatest need.  Because of their fragility we felt the greatest commitment to advocating for them.  The number of children is small but the consequences of excluding them from this iconic trilocation are not.  I also refer to the exclusion of mothers.  We are very conscious of the fact that mothers now need access to adult sub-specialty services because of increasing risk, co-morbidities and body mass indices, BMIs.  This is needed for mothers and particularly for babies.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach asked for an application for a co-build in 2014.  That did not happen.  We can revisit the history and note that deadlines were missed and calculations were erroneous.  Starting from this point however, I would love for the committee to make a recommendation in its meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The board's PowerPoint presentations to this committee mentioned wider community spin-offs, such as raising educational aspirations in the community, benefit to businesses in the community and employment and training opportunities.  However there was not one mention of the Coombe or of babies, and we are down the road from that hospital.  To me, that symbolised the way babies and maternity hospitals were excluded from the process. As a maternity hospital, we do not have the same political clout and influence as the bigger hospitals.  I think that is the case for all maternity hospitals.  However, at the present time there is a willingness to make this work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#PP01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Fitzpatrick's presentation and his vision and ambition.  We all agree with it.  We have gone around in circles about this hospital for the guts of 20 years.  There was controversy about the Mater Hospital, we looked at a site in Crumlin and then we came to St. James's Hospital.  Many are still of the opinion that it should not be on any of those sites, but in a new greenfield site or outside Connolly Hospital.  Building on a greenfield site would avoid all the problems that we have in fitting into the St. James's Hospital site.  It would be a lot cheaper to build on a new site than to go in with bulldozers and starting on a brownfield site.<\/p> <p>  Is it bad planning?  The Taoiseach said in 2014 that we should have trilocation.  That should be our ambition; to have a general hospital, a children's hospital and a maternity hospital together, a corridor away from one another.  One could open a door and go from one to the other instead of trying to transport patients across Dublin in an emergency, or in my constituents' case, all the way from Waterford or Kilkenny.  What Professor Fitzpatrick is saying makes sense.  He has covered this already, but why are we only now talking about the third part of the trilocation project?  Why was a maternity hospital not part of the recent planning for the national children's hospital?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the overspend.  We do not have the remit to make the recommendations Professor Fitzpatrick seeks.  This is the Committee of Public Accounts.  We follow the money when it is spent and make sure it is spent correctly.  We cannot recommend how money is spent.  That is not our remit.<\/p><p>We cannot tell the Government what to do, what decisions to make on policies or how to spend money.  It is our job to ensure money is spent to the taxpayers' benefit and value for money is achieved.  <\/p><p> On the site, is it large enough to facilitate the three hospitals and all of the associated facilities such as parking?  I am aware of the rail connection, but last week I read an article in one of the newspapers regarding the problems experienced by a man from rural Ireland trying to get into St. James's Hospital.  People are experiencing problems accessing the St. James's site even before the children's hospital has been built there or consideration given to the location of the maternity hospital there.  When all of that work is completed there will be even bigger problems in this area in terms of traffic congestion and parking.  The ambition is positive but is it possible to have all three facilities at this location?  There are many professionals in this country.  Why was the survey not undertaken before the JCBs were allowed on site?  The cost of the national children's hospital has increased from &euro;600 million to &euro;1.7 million and may increase further.  Is this another case of bad planning?  Was there no proper analysis of the site in its totality?  It is frustrating and annoying to hear that there may not be room for the maternity hospital on this site.

Medically, it would not work.  Space-wise, co-location-wise in terms of how to do it and access-wise, it works.  That is the issue.  What weighted the decision strongly in relation to St. James's Hospital is the fact that it is the largest adult hospital in the State and that cannot be undermined.  It is also the largest academic hospital in the State and that cannot be undermined.  In terms of what I would do, I would turn it on its head.  The decision is made.  We are now well into the project and massive excavation has been carried out.  The site should be stress tested now to ensure a maternity hospital can be co-located on it.  The money that this will cost is small fry given all the money that has been wasted.  We need to be absolutely certain that a maternity hospital can be provided on the site and then do it as quickly as possible.  There would be issues in terms of access and parking but the bottom line is the medicine and care that would be provided would be at the level that we aspire to.  It is a compromise.  If  the choice is access and double parking versus having the best people in the best place providing the best service I would put up with double parking.  That is not, I suppose, ideal, but this in the end is a compromise.  We have started it and I think it is too late to stop.  I want to make absolutely certain that a maternity hospital is provided.  I am looking at flexible ways this could be done in terms of space, cost and delivery.  If the remit of the committee is to ensure that money is spent appropriately, expenditure should not continue on this site with the expectation that it is going to deliver a maternity hospital if it cannot be proven that it will.  That work needs to start now otherwise value for money will not be achieved and a fortune will be wasted on this project only to find out that it has not delivered what it set out to deliver.  <\/p> <p>  I share the committee's concerns.  I have been neutral on the location of this hospital and I have advocated that it should go to Connolly Hospital when there were issues with space and access.  We are where we are and we need to deliver this hospital.  We need to bring people together to solve the problems that exist and accelerate the solution.  In the end, if the maternity hospital, the children's hospital, the adult hospital, the training, the teaching, the education and the innovation are there, all of which one wants in a brilliant health care centre, that could be the best thing in the world.  There may be a payoff in terms of access and parking but those issues could be sorted out in time.  Cities evolve and space around hospitals evolves.

The initial expressions of interest in the children's hospital in 2006 favoured its location on an adult hospital site.  Shortly after, due to representation by the children's hospitals and by the maternity hospitals, that was opened to include the provision of a maternity hospital.  In regard to the Mater project, it was a tri-location of the Mater hospital, the children's hospital and the Rotunda Hospital.  In regard to the St. James's Hospital project, it was the Coombe, St. James's Hospital and the children's hospital.  Every adult hospital that pitched to have the children's hospital on its site emphasised the importance of having a maternity hospital there.  The St. James's Hospital pitch for it included space for a maternity hospital with a footprint that would deliver a hospital of 42,000 sq. m., which was significant.  It was an important issue.  The reason it was not included in the planning permission at that time was, perhaps, cost and a little bit of fear in relation to making it too complex.  The Coombe does not have the same punching power as the adult hospitals.  It is their site and the Coombe is moving on-site and so we do not have control over what is happening.  Unfortunately, despite our very good relationship with St. James's Hospital I think we were sidelined in relation to it and sidelined also by politicians.  The problem with this project is that there are so many recriminations in relation to it.  The past is the past and we need to learn from the experience.

The problem is that all three have been operating above capacity for a long time.  Not only are they maternity hospitals, they are neonatal centres and gynaecology hospitals.  Where the three need to be has already been decided.  One is to be in St. Vincent's.  That was the neatest fit because of the fact that St. Vincent's was never going to have the paediatric hospital.  When the Mater was the designated site for the children's hospital, the Rotunda was to move to the Mater.  Since the site changed, the Rotunda is now instead to move to Connolly hospital.  Three hospitals are needed in Dublin.  I do not think we could ever get to the stage where we could rationalise them down to two.  We support what is happening in the other two hospitals.  The critical thing is that the big project is the children's hospital.  One cannot build a hospital that does not deliver what one sets out to deliver, especially if one spends more money on it than on any hospital in the world.

In international terms, the statistics from the maternity services in Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland are exceptionally good, although there are obviously cases where adverse circumstances happened that, looking back, could have been avoided.  One of the things we have been very concerned about over a long period of time is the resourcing of the maternity hospitals.  I cannot remember how many reports came out when I was master of the hospital which made recommendations for co-location, recommendations in terms of staff, recommendations in terms of infrastructure, etc., but very few of them were delivered.  We have a women and infants healthcare programme, which is still cash strapped.  We have the lowest number of obstetricians in the OECD.  These are issues that need to be addressed, but I think front-loading the maternity services with money improves outcome, improves quality of care and reduces adverse outcomes, and in reducing adverse outcomes, it reduces medical legal claims.  In terms of escalating medical legal claims, the way around that is to front-load investment into the service, and that, in a sense, would minimise risk.  The answer is \"Yes\" in terms of the development of new hospitals and new models of care and improving staffing levels and attracting people back from abroad who have gone away to train because they are looking at our maternity hospitals and are saying that they will not come back from Toronto or Sydney because they are working in state-of-the-art, tri-located centres.  Why would they come back?  <\/p> <p>  There may be difficulties recruiting people to work in the children's hospital, because they have seen a hospital mired in controversy.  To get the best and the brightest to come back to this country to work in our maternity and paediatric services, we need to deliver to them what they require in terms of infrastructure.

It is my pleasure to meet the members today for the first time as CEO of AIB.  The relationship between AIB and the State at every level is a matter of enormous importance to the bank and me.  I look forward to open, positive and productive engagement with the committee.  Alongside me are the members of my executive team: Ms Helen Dooley, Mr. Tom Kinsella and Mr. Jim O'Keeffe.<\/p> <p>  It was a privilege for me to be appointed to the helm of AIB.  I am keenly aware that the bank is not just a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and channels money into lending activities, critical as these functions are.  The bank plays a vital role in the Irish economy and operates under very strict social licence, reaching into every community across the country.<\/p> <p>  AIB and the State are inextricably linked.  With 2.2 million customers and a staff of almost 10,000, the bank has a uniquely close relationship with the country.  As a bank, we put the rights and interests of our customers first.  We must establish trustworthy financial products, support Ireland's positive economic development and ethically conduct our operations in compliance with regulatory requirements, stakeholder expectations and our customers' needs.<\/p> <p>  The financial services sector has experienced the implementation of far-reaching regulatory and supervisory reform.  Members are aware that we work in a radically transformed regulatory environment where the European Central Bank and Central Bank of Ireland concentrate on all aspects of our business, from customer conduct, prudential and policy perspectives.  Now, leadership, accountability and culture have come under particular scrutiny.  I support that level of surveillance.  I do not regard it as an imposition and I assure members we will continue to implement the standards and behaviours expected by our regulators, shareholders and customers.  I will continue to drive the kind of organisational culture that, over time, persuades the public we have successfully made the transition to a more customer-focused ethos.  Good culture is not built on slogans, however.  Good culture is built on unified and highly developed awareness of proper governance and an appreciation of the imperative to deliver fair outcomes for all our customers.  Enhancing accountability at every level across AIB is one of the cornerstones of my ambitions for the bank.<\/p> <p>  In addition to reinforcing a consumer-focused culture, another central priority of mine, as CEO, is to see the return to the State of the recapitalisation moneys provided by taxpayers following the financial crash.  At this point, AIB has returned &euro;10.8 billion in capital dividends, fees, coupons and levies.  The State's remaining shareholding, of 71%, currently has an estimated market value of some &euro;8 billion.  My team and I will spare no energy in ensuring AIB remains positioned to allow the Government to recoup its investment at a time of its choosing.<\/p><p>In order to achieve this, it is essential for the growing economy that AIB continue to be a well capitalised, sustainably profitable and stable institution that is sufficiently robust to deal with increased risks and uncertainty, including Brexit.  Without that basic profitability and stability, other bank functions and obligations cannot be fulfilled, most importantly, for our customers.<\/p><p> Members will be aware following the publication last month of AIB's 2018 annual report that the company delivered a strong operational performance.  Its full year profit before tax was &euro;1.25 billion, allowing the payment to our shareholders, including the State, of an increased dividend of &euro;461 million, bringing the total dividend paid by AIB to the State in the past three years to &euro;810 million.  New lending exceeded &euro;12 billion, up 15% on the figure for the previous year.  In spite of significant supply constraints in the housing market, mortgage lending rose by 16% to &euro;2.8 billion in 2018.<\/p><p> As a market leading bank, it is essential that we remain technically advanced.  The unrelenting customer shift to digital banking is increasing at a rate of 10% year on year.  Of our 1.8 million daily customer transactions, 1.4 million are now conducted via digital channels.  AIB has more than 1.38 million active digital customers, a growth curve that demands significant investment if it is to be the kind of digital retail bank that can compete in a rapidly changing and technologly driven world.  However, in addition to developing offerings such as our new digital business banking platform and dedicated apps, we must also focus investment on ongoing system resilience improvements.  The threat of cyber crime remains high in modern day banking and continuous risk management involves the purchase of costly tools and services.  New regulatory requirements for GDPR readiness also require a significant spend, as does the ongoing need for enhanced data and analytical capabilities.<\/p><p> When I joined AIB in August 2016, I was struck by a number of elements.  One was the tangible progress the bank had made in recovery and restructuring, while another was the level of resources still required to resolve enduring legacy issues, principally rooted in the financial crisis.  The committee is well versed in the facts surrounding the tracker mortgage examination which is now coming to a conclusion for AIB.  We are, of course, co-operating fully with the Central Bank of Ireland in its enforcement process.  The examination programme is materially complete, with final technical activities under way during 2019.  This does not in any way obviate the fact that we will continue to deal on an individual basis with impacted on accounts that require further attention through the appeals and complaints processes.  I am very aware of the financial losses and human distress caused by the tracker mortgage issue and can assure members that this chapter in the bank's history will not be finally closed until all adversely affected customers are properly compensated with fair settlements.<\/p><p> There is another legacy issue that does not just critically impact on the bank's viability and future, it also potentially impinges on the resilience of the economy.  It is the question of how we deal with non-performing loans, NPLs.  I emphasise the progress that has been made so far.  Exposure has fallen, from &euro;31 billion in 2013 to &euro;6.1 billion at the end of last year.  In personal customer terms, this means that there have been almost 100,000 solutions which include 43,000 primary dwelling houses, PDHs.  We are now ten years past the financial crisis.  In that time, AIB has devoted significant resources, including approximately 1,500 people, with the key objective of enabling our customers to stay in the family home, keeping viable businesses operating and supporting jobs.  We developed the largest range of solutions for customers in the Irish marketplace and continue to initiate new solutions such as the development of mortgage-to-rent with iCare.  We also engaged with a number of external agencies, including the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, StepChange and the IFA, in our overall approach to address customers' difficulties.<\/p><p> Our clear preference is to restructure on a case by case basis with customers who engage and provide sustainable solutions that sometimes include writing off debt.  We do this as retention of our customers in good and bad times is key to our sustainability as a bank.  As noted, 93% of our mortgage customers continue to meet the terms of their restructures.  Addressing NPLs in a sustainable way is essential to the resilience of the banking system and borrowers since elevated levels of NPLs will severely compromise the capacity of lenders and borrowers to weather future downturns.  The Central Bank, as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, continues to require banks to reduce NPLs to European averages by the end of 2019.  However, up to now, the NPL resolution process has been gradual and frequently lengthy.  The pace of reduction has begun to moderate as we deal with the more intractable cases.  Meanwhile, we cannot ignore the pressure the ECB is exerting on Irish banks to reduce within a relatively short timeframe their non-performing exposure, NPE, ratios.  At the end of 2018 AIB's NPE level was 9.6% of gross loans, or &euro;6.1 billion.  Last week we announced a portfolio sale of &euro;1 billion where 95% of the arrears were non-performing for over two years and 80% of connections were non-performing for over five years.  This sale further reduced our NPE ratio to market estimates of some 8%.  The European average is approximately 3.5% and our aim is to reach circa 5% by year end.  However, this should be seen as a milestone, not a destination.<\/p><p> AIB is still carrying a large chunk of deep long-term arrears that simply must be reduced.  It is imperative that we bring clarity to the debate and confront the reality of the impact of NPLs on individuals, the economy and banks' viability.  NPLs inhibit banks' primary function of lending to the economy and, ultimately, increase bank costs, resulting in higher rates for businesses and home buyers.  It is also true to say the individual customers who do meet their loan repayments are, in effect, negatively impacted on by those who do not repay.  Overall, Irish banks must hold more capital than other European banks because of our credit default history.  This requirement to hold large and expensive provisions or buffers against the possibility that customer debts will go into default means additional costs for customers.  For example, Irish banks must hold approximately &euro;50 of capital for every &euro;1,000 of lending compared to &euro;16 per &euro;1,000 in the case of other European banks.  The deeper the arrears, the greater the buffers, all of which impacts on banks' ability to function normally.  AIB has to ensure it is not left vulnerable to future economic downturns by existing NPLs and potentially new defaults.  While the bank is very well capitalised, as CEO, I would find it unconscionable to allow it to confront future shocks while still fettered by legacy issues we can actually deal with now.  To best equip the bank to deal with future economic challenges and continue to support the economy and our customers, we must work to put our balance sheet in the strongest possible position.<\/p><p> I appreciate that some members of the committee are strongly opposed to the sale of NPL portfolios, but let me be clear.  AIB is not in the business of allowing its customers to be cast aside as an inconvenience.  The Oireachtas has ensured the protections of the Central Bank of Ireland's codes of conduct are transferred with the loans to the new owners, something we fully support.  Our strong preference is to retain these customer relationships where they are in our mutual interest and the customers engage with us.  <\/p><p> Meeting the demand for housing is obviously a continuing struggle for the market, in spite of a 25% increase in the number of new dwellings completed last year.  AIB is actively engaged in residential development as an area of strategic importance for the economy and the bank.  In 2018 the bank was the primary funder for live developments comprising 4,600 units - up by 53% on the figure for 2017 - as well as funding &euro;175 million of mortgages for self-builds.  We are in our third year of funding a development in Poppintree in Dublin for the not-for-profit developer &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance.  It has proved to be a strikingly impressive model for affordable housing, allowing local purchasers with a maximum income of &euro;79,000 to buy their own home.  <\/p><p> Brexit is, of course, just one of the exposures Ireland faces as a small highly globalised economy.  We are also conscious of cyclical risks associated with changes to international trade patterns and taxation regimes.  I mentioned the symmetries between AIB and Ireland.  We must all work to ensure resilience in the economy and the financial system in the face of these risks.  We may not be able to control the external environment, but we must be alive to actions we can take domestically to minimise future adversity and downturns.  As of now, Ireland's economic outlook remains positive.  I am very glad to become CEO of a bank that can help to fuel the economy and play a strategic role in ensuring the future of the company and that the country will remain optimistic.  We very much appreciate the opportunity to meet the committee and look forward to taking members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019041100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colin Hunt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Hunt and his colleagues.

I presume that is the number of mortgage accounts in this category.  We have been looking at this issue for some time, as has the Central Bank of Ireland and AIB.  We had extensive engagement with Dr. Hunt's predecessor and the bank's team on 26 September 2017 and 23 January 2018.  We also had detailed engagement with the Central Bank on 18 January 2018.  Coming in as the new CEO affords Dr. Hunt the opportunity to take a fresh look at the issue.  I suggest he do that, if he has not already done so.  <\/p><p> It is clear from the original mortgage documentation that when this group of customers came to the end of the fixed rate period for their mortgages, they were then to have the option of continuing with a fixed interest rate for a further period, converting to a variable interest rate mortgage or to a tracker interest rate mortgage.  The documentation goes on to state it would be at the bank's prevailing rates appropriate to the mortgage loan.  \"Prevailing rates\" is not defined within the mortgage documentation, as far as I can see.  However, a tracker interest rate mortgage is defined in section 3.6 of the documentation as being a mortgage at the ECB rate, which is a published rate, with a tracker margin as stated in Part 1 of the particulars of offer of a mortgage loan.  To my knowledge, Part 1 does not actually specify the margin.  <\/p><p> AIB withdrew tracker rate mortgages for new customers in October 2008.  However, existing customers continued to remain on a tracker rate mortgage, while those coming off the fixed rate had a contractual entitlement to be offered a tracker rate.  There was, therefore, a breach of contract which the bank was late in acknowledging.  It did so eventually under pressure from the Central Bank.  AIB is on very thin ice in its interpretation of the prevailing rates, of which there is no definition.  After looking at the issue, customers had a legitimate expectation that the prevailing rate - this is the only element up for discussion - was the margin that prevailed at the time the mortgages were initially given out or the margin for a tracker interest rate mortgage when customers came to the end of their period on a fixed rate.

The tracker rate mortgage issue is a stain on the reputation of AIB and other Irish banks.  It arose from a lack of foresight, weak controls and poor communication.  As CEO, I want us to draw a line under the affair once we have concluded the examination and resultant enforcement to the satisfaction of the Central Bank of Ireland.  We have been engaging on this issue for more than three years.  A significant number of people have been working on it, which is right and appropriate.

The customers we are discussing are in that category.  There has, therefore, been a breach of contract which I think AIB now accepts.  That is the nub of the issue.  Mr. Kinsella has said no tracker interest rate mortgage was available when the customers came off their fixed interest rate mortgage, but they were entitled to be offered a tracker interest rate mortgage at the prevailing rate.

That was the prevailing rate.  There was also a prevailing rate when the customers in question who had a contractual entitlement were offered and drew down their mortgage.  There was a defined margin that applied to tracker interest rate mortgages at the time, even though it was not specified in their contracts.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Kinsella has given an interpretation that is very much in the bank's favour.  Dr. Hunt spoke about a customer focused culture.  Without a doubt, there is ambiguity in this case.  An argument can be made in both directions, but it is not clear.  As I said, there is no definition of \"prevailing rate\".  Trackers interest rate mortgage were gone for new customers, but existing customers of AIB continued to have them.  The only issue is what the margin should be.  The ECB rate is a published rate.  My analysis is it should have been the margin that applied when the mortgages were taken out.  I refer to the margin generally offered by the bank on its tracker interest rate mortgages at the point in time or the margin that continued to apply to existing tracker interest rate mortgages.

However, it is important to bear in mind the context in which we are undertaking these measures.  We are 11 years post the peak of the financial crisis.  We are under instruction from our regulator to continue to reduce our non-performing exposures down to European averages.  Even leaving aside the instruction from the regulator, I am very conscious of the fact that this is an economic cycle that has had a very long run.  The global economy has performed very well in recent years but I am equally conscious of the fact that we are beginning to see some straws in the wind regarding the economic outlook for the next number of years.  The Deputy would have noted the International Monetary Fund, IMF, earlier this week reduced its growth forecast for Ireland.  Last week, the World Trade Organization reduced its estimate for growth in trade globally last year from 4% to something of the order of 3%.  We are dealing with major uncertainties with respect to potential trade wars and potential economic wars between America and China and that is not to take into account the stress Brexit is imposing on the economy.  We have managed to escape having a hard Brexit tomorrow but the can has been just being kicked down the road for another six months and that impact is being felt particularly by our small and medium sized enterprises.  In the opening quarter of last year we saw the deferral of many investment decisions taking place because many of the small and medium sized enterprises we service are very heavily dependent on the British economy.  If there was no certainty about their ability to access that market, they were not willing to take the sort of investment decisions that would be conducted in the ordinary course of business.  We are dealing with a very uncertain economic outlook.  I have an obligation as the chief executive officer as have my colleagues, as members of my team, to ensure that when times are reasonably good we put the balance sheet of the bank into the strongest possible position now so that we can continue to support our customers regardless of what the economic cycle throws at us over the course of the next number of years.  That is the context in which we are reducing our non-performing exposures.  We have a very clear preference to engage with our customers to come to agreed solutions and to keep them as customers of AIB but no option can be ruled out because the overriding consideration must be to put the bank in the strongest possible position to deal with whatever may unfold in terms of an economic downturn ahead of us.

We are very eager to support our customers at this time.  We are eager to see lending to SME enterprises growing over time.  We have restructured the way we address this market in recent months to become ever more customer focused, to have an end-to-end solution for our customers in the business space.  It is a simple truth that Brexit has had an extraordinary impact on business confidence.  We have been running a Brexit sentiment tracker for the past number of years both north of the Border and in the Republic.  It is overwhelmingly negative on SME expectations for Brexit.  One things that has struck and surprised me has been that the degree of negative sentiment is much greater in the Republic than north of the Border.  That is a reflection of the scale of the British marketplace versus the Irish one and also of the clear dependence and reliance of many small and medium sized Irish enterprises on the UK as an export destination.

I hope to serve for a very long time, something that will be determined, largely, by the board in its appraisal of my performance.  <\/p> <p>  My ambition for the institution is to see its reputation being fully restored in the eyes of its customers and the public.  Underpinning that restoration of reputation are three factors.  They are issues I have called out to all of the people who work within AIB, its shareholders and customers, the first of which is cultural change.  We have made significant progress in recent years in emphasising the primacy of the needs of our customers.  It is enshrined in our values and pillars.  If one was to ask anyone who works in AIB to explain our pillars and values, the first thing they would say is that we put our customer first.  That has been recognised externally: it is not just me who is saying it.  Alongside it, we have further work to do in enhancing openness and transparency in how we deal with all stakeholders, be they employees, shareholders, policy makers, politicians or regulators.  This is something I will certainly be promoting in the next few years.<\/p> <p>  Accountability is the second issue on which I want to see significant progress.  On a personal level, I am very conscious of the fact that the Central Bank of Ireland is enthusiastic about introducing a senior executive accountability regime.  The only thing delaying it is the availability of parliamentary time.  I welcome that development which should be applauded.  We are already preparing for it within AIB.<\/p> <p>  The third prominent feature that I want to characterise my time as CEO of the institution is sustainability.  The bank has a greater role to play in the decarbonisation of the economy, supporting renewable energy development within the economy and further afield and committing to supporting the sustainability of communities throughout the State.  There is an inexorable drive towards digitalisation and mobile transactions.  In 2015 the number of interactions or touch points between us and our customers conducted using mobile devices to check a balance, rather than make a transaction, was nearly 148,000 per day.  Today it is 1.2 million.  Despite the race towards digitalisation, it is very important that we continue to have the best-in-class digital technology.  Given the number of interactions with our customers, we are by some margin Ireland's biggest financial technology company.  We marry that highly efficient, speedy means of engagement with our customers with a commitment to communities in the form of our staff who operate all around the State and live and work in every county.  I remain very committed to having the shop window our branch network provides us all around the island.  There are more than 200 AIB branches and more than 70 EBS branches.  This forms a very important part of our sustainability as a bank and commitment to communities.  By sustainability I mean something far broader than renewable energy, although renewable energy development is a major personal priority for me and the institution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019041100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colin Hunt"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Hunt.

I will raise the general matters of the case; it is not a unique set of circumstances.  The person involved is probably one of thousands of customers in this position.  He is an EBS customer with a tracker mortgage issue.  He was on a fixed rate and when that expired he moved on to a standard variable rate.  At the end of the fixed rate period, tracker rates were available to new customers walking in off the streets.  The rates were advertised and tracker rates were being made available.  This man was not informed of all the options open to him.  He was only told about the fixed and standard variable rate options.  It is undisputed that if he had asked for a tracker rate, the bank would have said that he was entitled to one.  The point is that the man had a theoretical right to access the tracker rate in that if he had known about it, he would have been able to access it.  However, on the official documentation he was provided with, informing him of his contractual rights, the option of the tracker mortgage was not provided.  The final response letter of the EBS states that staff do not provide advice on which interest option to choose, that this is the decision of the mortgage holder and that the obligation rests with the customer to advise the bank of his or her decision.  That is absolutely fine, but under best practice and the spirit of the consumer protection code, this man would contend, as would I, that EBS had an obligation to provide him with advice about the full range of products available to him.

There is a very long observation window in that regard that the regulator applies in arriving at the risk-weighted asset - the risk it applies to our balance sheet.  That will improve over time.  Second, the level of NPLs is also reflected in what we call our core equity tier 1 requirement.

It is an ask on my part because there are a lot of people who are watching in about this issue or who will read the transcript later on.  I encourage AIB to move away from what I would regard as an overly legalistic approach to this issue.  I know that Ms Dooley has a job and she is essentially the chief legal person within the bank but the real test of culture change comes when a bank is faced with a situation where there is the bounce of the ball.  Does the ball bounce on the side of the consumer or on the side of the bank when it comes down to a choice?  AIB needs to replace the thought process of what it must do with what it should do.  For me, looking at the paperwork and the documentation objectively, the bounce of the ball on this issue should favour the consumer because when one looks at the paperwork, it is very evident that there is an omission in the mortgage contract.  The mortgage contract refers to a tracker margin in another part of the document and it is just not there when one goes looking for it.  What AIB is doing as a bank, from my perspective, is that it is benefitting from an omission in its own mortgage documentation, and that is wrong.<\/p> <p>  If I were Dr. Hunt coming in as a fresh new CEO, I would look at this again and I would remove the risk, which is very significant, that the High Court or the ombudsman will eventually force the bank to change its position on this issue.  Given the journey that AIB has travelled as a bank and the work it has done to repair its reputation in dealing with the other tracker issues, it would be a great shame if AIB was forced to make a change of direction on this issue.  I will leave that as a final message.  AIB should move away from that legalistic approach of what it has to do and replace it with a thought process of what it should do to demonstrate that AIB really has changed as a bank and is putting the interests of consumers first.

I encourage AIB, whatever organisation it is using, to try to expand on the proposal that is there and to engage with that proposal before it engages with a vulture fund.  I say that because, like other banks and the Central Bank, AIB tells us that the protections travel with the loan.  Very shortly, the witnesses will hear through this committee about the effects that a vulture fund can have on individuals and how they are treated and it flies completely in the face of all of that legislation and protocol on the protections we talk about.  It does not work and that it why there is an onus on the banks, regardless of how difficult it is, to continue to drill down into these loans and to determine if people can be kept in their homes and have them pay a sustainable mortgage or rent.

The bank cannot retrospectively engineer a rate.  It must go to the point where the bank entered into the contract.  It will be played out in court.  I have seen some very serious legal opinion, although lawyers will differ and so forth, but the idea is to allow this to play out in court.  Dr. Hunt is a new CEO and this is an opportunity to resolve some of the legacy issues.  He should take that opportunity.  He should at least take the opportunity to bring fresh eyes to this.  In particular, will he give a commitment to the committee with respect to any individual who is taking court proceedings against AIB whereby if AIB settles that case, he will ensure that it will also settle with all 6,000 other individuals affected by the same situation?  Too often we have seen instances where somebody has a very strong legal challenge and is willing to take on an institution such as AIB, but the institution knows the person has a case and it settles.  With a confidentiality clause it manages the settlement and pays the one or two individuals concerned, but the other 6,000 are left high and dry.<\/p> <p>  Can Dr. Hunt also speak to us about the Statute of Limitations and whether that will apply to the other 6,000, many of whom have not initiated legal proceedings at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019041100002#T01500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554937200,"counter":1061,"content":"<p>I will hand over to Ms Helen Dooley in a moment.

As I am sure members will be aware, the purpose of the commission is to represent the interests of victims and survivors of the Troubles.  Part of my legislative duty - and it is one of the best parts - is that I convene a forum of victims and survivors who help make sure that victims themselves are at the heart of legislation and policy in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  This is the second time I have addressed this committee, and this meeting is timely both in the context of our policy advice and suggestions to the Government of Ireland regarding the consultation on dealing with the past, but also in the context of EU exit and on the ongoing implementation of the PEACE IV programme in Northern Ireland.  I would like to start by providing some brief commentary on these important developments, particularly regarding legacy-related matters.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will be very aware that the Good Friday Agreement made a commitment to remember and care for those who were harmed during the Troubles.<\/p><p>It is my belief that there has been a number of very substantial attempts over the years to address the harm that was done but that so far the legislation we need on both sides of the Border has failed to be agreed and failed to be passed to address the needs of victims and survivors.  The fact is, as we sit here today, that bereaved families who wish to access judicial processes, who come from every part of society, from across the United Kingdom, Ireland and beyond, are told they must wait decades, if at all, before they can get access to investigations, to justice, to information about the death of people they loved, and to acknowledgement of the harm they suffered.  That has a growing cost.  It has a cost to families and people in terms of their belief that the state they live in cares what happened to them, in terms of their faith in government and justice organisations, and in terms of the communities&rsquo; faith in justice organisations, particularly in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> Judicial reviews and legal actions have also got a high financial cost and the irony is that &pound;30 million a year was spent for decades on dealing with legacy in ways that did not work and fighting judicial reviews and actions.  It is more expensive to do nothing and to continue as we are than it would be to introduce new mechanisms that would have a better chance of delivering for victims and survivors.  It is almost universally accepted that the current system in Northern Ireland and beyond is not equipped to address the situation.  It was not designed to do so, and the cost of this failure is evident at many levels.  For individuals, families and communities across these islands who are impacted there is still acute pain and loss and that is now accompanied by a strong sense that those who are empowered to address their issues have chosen to ignore them for decades.  That is why dealing with the legacy of the past cannot be achieved by measures which fail to fully address the many complex and difficult issues.<\/p><p> It is also very clear that in the context of high levels of disillusionment and low levels of trust which exist across different political constituencies in Northern Ireland and in Ireland that any approach must be balanced, it must be transparent, it must operate within the law and it must be victim centred.  People who have suffered harm have waited too long for effective organisations to address their needs.<\/p><p> In relation to legacy and the recent consultation, in May 2018 the UK Government published its consultation paper addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland's past.  It set out draft legislation for implementing the historical investigations unit, HIA, the oral history archive, OHA, the independent commission for information retrieval and the implementation and reconciliation group.  There were 18,000 responses to that consultation, and as we still await its outcome victims and survivors continue to be frustrated by the failure to deliver on those legacy mechanisms.  While recognising that these delays have a link to the current political impasse I would still strongly impress on all our political representatives the need to agree proposals to deal with the past.  People have waited too long.<\/p><p> I wish to reflect on some changes which I believe could make these proposals more victim centred and inclusive but, in spite of anything one might say about the current proposals that they can be improved and should be improved, the need to find a new way forward is unarguable.  There is really no good case for continuing to deal with these matters in the way they are currently dealt with.  In January 2019 I offered this advice to the UK Government and it set out the commission's views on the basis of extensive consultation on the four proposals.<\/p><p> For the first time my policy advice paper also provides comments for consideration by the Irish Government on how to ensure that the needs of victims and survivors are met in the Republic of Ireland.  When talking to people affected by the conflict across the United Kingdom and Ireland it is clear that their experience and needs are very much the same.  I believe these need should be addressed in an inclusive way and that choices and options which are open to those who live in Northern Ireland should also be open to those who live elsewhere.  That is why, for the first time, I have shared my advice and made proposals to the Government of Ireland.<\/p><p> The recommendations in my policy advice have been made after extensive engagement with the victims and survivors forum, with individual victims and survivors, strategic partners, elected representatives, policy makers and organisations funded to deliver services as well as wider civic society.  That has taken place across the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.  The advice I am giving to both Governments also is guided by five key principles agreed by the victims and survivors forum.  The first is co-design and collaboration.  If one is going to do something to address the needs of people who have been harmed, one must do it in a spirit of co-design with those people.  For example, I have recommended that a victims and survivors steering group be part of mechanisms to investigate.  I give information to families and in every part of these proposals I have suggested greater engagement of victims and survivors in the design.  They must be victim centred and victim led.  That means the needs, interest, views and wishes of individual victims and survivors takes priority.  For example, in relation to each of these institutions I have talked about the need for advocacy and support to enable people to make the choices that are right for them and to enable them to be supported and to be advocated for.<\/p><p> The third principle I look for is inclusivity.  Many people have been excluded from the scope of these proposals and that includes people who lost people they loved outside of Northern Ireland, in the Republic of Ireland, across the UK and elsewhere.  There is a sense of isolation and inequality felt by those victims who often experience a low level of access to support, and a lower access to justice in some cases than those elsewhere.<\/p><p> It is absolutely critical that whatever we do is done in a way which is independent and impartial.  Trust is paramount and it is at a very low level for victims and survivors for very understandable reasons.  That is true across the UK and for those people to whom I have spoken in the Republic of Ireland.  For example, on the part of both Governments, there are concerns that some matters may be redacted on the basis of national security.  In addition, for both Governments there is a real need to make sure that any institutions therefore are as transparent as they can be, robust in terms of having appeal mechanisms against redaction and that families are given the absolute maximum explanation and access to information and can see that that is happening.  That matters wherever people live and wherever the bereavement took place.  All mechanisms must be fit for purpose so, for example, timeframes and funding have to be realistic.  There is no point doing things and then not funding them properly.  We have had decades of experience of that.  It creates disillusionment and distrust.<\/p><p> In relation to more general issues in addressing legacy, in the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, consultation the Secretary of State has clearly detailed that, first and foremost, they must meet the needs of victims and survivors.  They must seek to promote reconciliation and they must reflect broad political consensus.  I welcome those broad principles.  However, while I am of the view that these proposals currently are the best opportunity we have, there are significant changes that need to be made to address the principles I have outlined.  The purpose of historical investigations should not be defined narrowly in terms of the numbers of prosecutions.  That is not primarily what the investigations need to deliver.  What matters to people is evident from previous and ongoing investigations, that is, that new information and evidence can be uncovered and that families who want answers can be better served than they have been, even if the evidence is likely in many cases to be insufficient to secure a conviction.  The critical issues for many families and communities as well are access to information about the circumstances leading to the death of people they loved and acknowledgement of the harm that has been done to them.  I have sought in my advice to draw out what the implications of that should be and what the focus on family should look like for the objectives, the structure, the staffing and the processes of historical investigations.<\/p><p>This is not a normal investigation.  It is not just about getting convictions and it is worth doing even if convictions are going to be very few and far between.<\/p><p> It is often pointed out that different people have different wishes and needs and therefore it is right that the proposed package of measures offers choices and options to individuals and families but, however, these choices and options must be accompanied by support and information so people can make the decisions that are right for them.  That would mean the people who want information can be given the best opportunity they have, but at the same time those who do not want information, of whom there are many, and there are some in every family, are not routinely delivered with packages of information they do not want.  It is important that there is an intelligent and informed way of communicating with families.  Advocacy services are critical for people when they engage with legacy institutions.  My recommendations seek to ensure that all of the institutions build in links to what currently exists in the way of advocacy and enhancement of that to meet new demands.<\/p><p> There are 47 recommendations and I do not propose to go right through them, but there are some broad areas with specific reference to the Government of Ireland.   In the case of historical investigations, I have requested that the Irish Government establish a mechanism whereby Troubles-related deaths which happened in the Republic are investigated.  I know the scope of the current proposal relates only to deaths that occur in Northern Ireland, but I have talked to people who lost loved ones within this country and they feel just the same.  There should never be a two-tier approach.  One cannot have a hierarchy based on location in terms of how people access truth and justice.  It is my strong submission that there needs to be a new mechanism here as well to investigate outstanding Troubles-related deaths.<\/p><p> I have also heard from bereaved families in Ireland and across the UK whose access to both civil and criminal justice processes is dependent on the close collaboration between justice organisations in different jurisdictions.  I welcome the development of legislation by the Irish Government to facilitate exchange of information for legacy inquests.  I believe that new organisations will need to work very effectively and share information across jurisdictions if they are going to build trust and to deliver what can be delivered to victims and survivors.<\/p><p> For both Governments there are issues regarding information considered as sensitive regarding national security.  There is also a need for both Governments to establish fully transparent and accountable processes for determining what information can be withheld or should be withheld on those grounds.  Victims and survivors across the UK and Ireland, for very understandable reasons, feel that both Governments could use redaction on the grounds of national security as a cloak behind which to hide unpalatable facts.  Whether that perception is accurate or not, it is entirely understandable if there is not as transparent a process as is achievable.<\/p><p> On the independent commission for information retrieval, which is based on the treaty between the UK and Irish Governments and is accessible to people across both jurisdictions, I have recommended that they should have a victims and survivors steering group in the same way as I have recommended the historical investigations process.  It is just as important that there is an intelligent, informed approach based on consultation with victims and survivors about how this institution engages with families, how it seeks to inform its deliverables on the basis of what families want.  It is very important that in deciding what questions should be asked, information retrieval is led by the wishes of victims and survivors.  Anything given through an information retrieval process can be structured in individual cases around the questions families have to ask, so engaging with families in an inclusive way and basing the work of the institution on families&rsquo; wishes is the best way for it to deliver what it can deliver.<\/p><p> I have also recommended that there would be a proactive outreach strategy because to be inclusive, people have to know one exists.  If information retrieval is something that many people do not know exists, then they cannot use it, so inclusivity means outreach and communication.  I have recommended that an appeals process similar to that of the historical investigations unit should be put in place if there is any decision to redact information on national security grounds.<\/p><p> I recognise that the danger of information leaking between information retrieval and investigations is a real danger which must be removed.  At the same time, the obvious answer of sequencing one then the other is not necessarily a very victim-friendly answer.  There will be people and families who may already feel they have got as much as they can get from an investigative process and they may want to move forward into information retrieval.  Telling them they have another decade to wait may be time that they do not have.  It is important that in seeking to solve those design problems, there is extensive consultation with victims and survivors and perhaps even consideration of giving some ability to families to choose the route they go down when time is short.<\/p><p> Another key issue to be addressed, in particular in relation to information retrieval, is the impact of incomplete or incorrect information.  I have met and talked to people who have been given information which has then turned out not to be correct, which is worse than being given nothing.<\/p><p> The oral history archive is an incredibly important proposal for something which can capture narratives and grow understanding in a way that can help build reconciliation as well as giving people the right to have their experiences acknowledged, heard and recorded.  It is important that it is done in an inclusive way.  I reiterate a point I have made previously, namely, that it cannot be something that sits in a building somewhere.  It must be based on outreach.  It cannot be inclusive unless it is communicated properly and contributed to in a bottom-up way by different communities.  It is also important that nobody thinks they are excluded from it by having signed the Official Secrets Act, for example.  Those things need to be dealt with to do that in an inclusive way.  This is about growing reconciliation so something that captures narratives in a way that grows understanding is incredibly important to that.<\/p><p> The legislative proposals on the implementation and reconciliation group are incredibly thin and yet the basic idea of it, what is at the heart of the mechanism, is probably the most important of all.  If it is to be about acknowledgement and capturing what comes out of the other processes in a way that helps people move on, then it must be independent of political interference.  The way it is proposed at the moment, which is almost a kind of d'Hondt process where people can get elected onto it at the proposal of a political party and withdrawn by a political party without any reason given will not grow its ability to deliver a composite independent narrative based on the information coming into it.  For it to achieve its purpose, it is important that there are clear criteria for the nomination of an individual to that group, and that there would be an equally clear basis on which someone can be removed from it, and that its purpose in terms of giving acknowledgement to those who suffered needs to be more strongly built into the way it is put together.  That can be on an individual or much more societal level.<\/p><p> There are other issues to consider, which in the interests of time I will not go into in detail.  In relation to accessing services here in Ireland and in other parts of the UK and Great Britain, outside Northern Ireland, it is welcome that we have funding under PEACE IV, which is now starting to deliver health and well-being services to people who have not had it before, but if we are going to properly deal with people's needs and if we are going to do that in the context of properly dealing with difficult issues in the past then there is going to be a growing need, for a while, for advocacy, support, health and well-being and mental health services.<\/p><p> In relation to mental health in particular, the growth of the regional trauma network is incredibly important.  It is something that has been very slow because of the difficulty of getting policy progressed and funding in the current absence of the assembly in Northern Ireland.  However, it is beginning to be developed and it will be operational within the next year and it is needed as much in Ireland as it is in Northern Ireland, in particular in relation to the current proposals.<\/p><p>I strongly suggest that the committee look at how health in the North and in Ireland can work together on this critically important area of mental health and trauma that is related to the Troubles.  Given the scale and complexity of the mental health legacy of the Troubles, it is very important that people have access to high-quality services and mental health services which are nuanced to an understanding of Troubles related trauma.<\/p><p> Above all, it is important to remember that the aim of addressing legacy must be to build a better future.  At a civic and a political level there continues to be a war of words about the harm inflicted on different individuals and different communities during the Troubles.  This in itself is often to the detriment of those who suffered.  My recommendations, therefore, seek to ensure that the combined impact of this package is to offer what is achievable in terms of truth, justice, acknowledgement and reparation to people who were harmed and to do this in a way that is victim centred, respectful and inclusive of all those who suffered.  The proposed mechanisms are designed to address the outstanding impact of the conflict on the people, communities and institutions of Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK and in Ireland.  It is a difficult process which is uncomfortable for all, but it needs to be uncomfortable for all to deliver the outcomes which have been sought.  Without these difficult conversations, the Civil Service in Northern Ireland will continue to be anchored to a trauma and division which the Troubles wrought.  Twenty-one years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the broad shape of these measures seems to me to be what we have come back to time and, again and it is the best chance we have of dealing with the outstanding, unfinished business.  Although these proposals can be improved and require some changes, they are still a basis on which we can improve the well-being of victims and survivors and build a better and more reconciled society for all.<\/p><p> I thank members for their time.  I am very happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019041100002#B01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Judith Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>I should be here for most of the meeting.  The Chairman has to leave before I do.  Listening to Ms Thompson and reading the policy paper, my immediate reaction is, &ldquo;If only she were the Minister for justice for Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic.&rdquo;  What she says is just so practical and common sense and it is what we hear from the victims, or in my case Justice for the Forgotten.  I chair that group, as the Chairman did before me.  What Ms Thompson says is just so true to their story, their experience and what they have been looking for.  Twenty-one years since the Good Friday Agreement, they are waiting 45 years now, or 46 this year.  It is incredible.<\/p> <p>  Reading through the policy paper, one thing that really struck me was the statement that in the policy sphere &ldquo;it is paramount that information is not seen to be withheld by any government or institution&rdquo;.  We know the blocks from the British Government on that information, even refusing to hand it to an independent international judicial figure.  The paper also refers to an entitlement to justice &ldquo;regardless of where a death happened&rdquo;.  There is a feeling that the Troubles related deaths that occurred in the Republic are not seen to be as important or to have the same parity as those that occurred in Northern Ireland.  The paper also states: &ldquo;It is imperative that both the UK and Irish governments provide the necessary resources to allow all conflict related deaths to be fully investigated.&rdquo;  This is what the families and the victims have been looking for.  We have had questions here with our Ministers and meetings on a historical investigations unit, HIU, in the Republic and they always say no, that it is not part of the agreement.  Will the witnesses &ndash; whoever wants to answer the question &ndash; see this happening in order that there is that parity?<\/p> <p>  Regarding amnesties, we know there are different views as to whether we should draw a line under everything and go for information retrieval and not look for anything else.  How should these two be balanced?  A lot of costs will be involved in much of what Ms Thompson says.  Is she confident that these costs can be met?  The witnesses have had discussions with our Government.  Will they tell us how confident they are that the Government is taking seriously their recommendations and, equally, those of other authorities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019041100002#E00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554937200,"counter":1113,"content":"<p>If it is okay with Mr. Bracknell, I would like him to take the first question about providing in Ireland something like the historical investigations unit.

I attend the same meetings to which she has referred.  Whenever we in the victims&rsquo; forum have had discussions on dealing with the past, the point we have all made is that everyone should be treated equally.  It does not matter where the harm happened or who inflicted it.  Equal treatment is what is most important.  As the proposals stand, people who were bereaved or injured south of the Border and people who were bereaved or injured in Britain do not avail of a similar package in respect of investigations.  That is the information that has to be addressed which we in the Victims and Survivors Forum passed on up to Ms Thompson.  It is good to see it in her proposals here.  The point is that if this is not done, it creates a hierarchy of victims.  Our ask today is that this committee exercise whatever influence it can on the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of the Taoiseach and tell them they have to put in place something south of the Border that is on a parallel with the HIU in the North.  We recently met the Garda Commissioner and his point basically was that this is Government policy.  The only people who can change that are in the Government.  Therefore, whatever can be done from within this committee and whatever other committees there are is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019041100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Bracknell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554937200,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>Regarding the issue of an amnesty, it does not matter whether I talk to people in Ireland, the United Kingdom or other parts of Great Britain, I do not for the most part meet victims and survivors who want there to be an amnesty.  I meet many people who say prosecutions are not that important to them, but that is different from saying there should be no attempt to uncover the truth of what happened.  It does not matter whether one talks to soldiers&rsquo; families &ndash; soldiers were often killed &ndash; or to people who died at the hands of the army.  None of these people wants to be told that the way to draw a line under this is to bury it.  That is what they have been told already and it just feels like a lack of acknowledgement that what happened mattered.  The point is that to move on, to draw that line, information needs to be given to those who want it and there must be an acknowledgement at a much more civic level of the wrong and the harm that was done.  That is how one draws a line and moves on.  One does not do so by suppressing investigation.  I think everyone in this room is very familiar with the arguments about the legality of an amnesty.  It is very clear.  It can be legal if it is universal for all parties to the conflict and is accompanied by an information retrieval process.  That is not the conversation I hear happening.  What I hear is a conversation about whether this person or that person should not be pursued or held accountable.  I am afraid that uncomfortable accountability is part of this process.  It is not about pillorying individuals who are elderly now, no matter who they are, but it is about saying harm happened and that people who were harmed and who want information are entitled to it, regardless of what happens to the person who caused that harm.  At the end of the day, under the law, there should be a fair, impartial, competent investigation into somebody&rsquo;s death.  That is all people are looking for.<\/p> <p>  The terms of the Good Friday Agreement, as people in this room are very aware, still apply.  They apply to everyone, including soldiers.  No one will do more than two years in prison, even if they were convicted, and the likelihood of anyone being convicted is pretty low.<\/p><p>What is important is access to information and an acknowledgement.  Talking about amnesties is a distraction in providing it and in moving on.  It is not lawful to provide for amnesties in the way in which it is often proposed to provide for them and I do not believe it would meet the needs of victims and survivors or society more generally in dealing with the past in a way that would allow people to draw a line and move on.  That is my take on the question of amnesties.<\/p><p> On costs, yes, this would be expensive, but I ask the committee to consider adding up what it is now costing to do nothing.  We are not doing anything.  Certainly, in the United Kingdom there are repeated legal actions and mounting costs arising from judicial reviews.  We finally have funding to properly equip coroners&rsquo; courts to deal with a backlog of 50 cases.  We also have a legacy investigation branch within the Police Service of Northern Ireland which is neither equipped nor constructed in a way which enables it to have the confidence of the public and the courts in doing its job, but it is still costing money to run it.  In 2013 the criminal justice inspectorate produced a report in which it added up what it thought was the cost of dealing with the past in Northern Ireland.  It stated the figure was &pound;30 million a year.  I think those costs have gone up, not down, and we have been spending this money for decades, but it should not be about money.  However, if we are going to talk about it, I ask the committee to consider adding up the cost of what we are now doing and set it against how the money could be spent better.  I argue that we need to do different things to deal with the past in terms of justice, as well as spending more on mental health, advocacy and support services for victims and survivors.  The long-term results would be much better for people, families, victims and survivors and, naturally, communities and civic society also.<\/p><p> Regarding conversations with the Government, we are delighted to be here.  In the consultation we were certainly helpfully assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We also worked with Justice for the Forgotten in contacting people, as well as with Austin Stack and others connected with him to get people together, but the proof of the pudding will be in what is implemented.  I know that there is ongoing work on legislation to enable information to be passed between jurisdictions on civil matters, but more is needed.  As Mr. Bracknell described, there is a need for a counterpart to this investigative unit working here.  I have had the same conversation with families in Birmingham.  There is a need for something to happen in parts of the United Kingdom also.  People who have been left wanting for decades do not expect the system that has failed to deliver to date to do better for them next time and why should they?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019041100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Judith Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>I thank the commissioner for her presentation and Mr. Bracknell.  It is on days like today that my belief in politics is restored.  The first thing I want to say is that this report should be delivered to each and every one of the victims and survivors.  Sometimes I think, although this is a live broadcast, we are talking to ourselves.  If the report was delivered to the victims and survivors, it would certainly give me some faith that some progress had been made.  The old adage that justice delayed is justice denied is so true.  I have said at a number of committee meetings that if one were not told who was making the presentation and from which side of the divide someone was from, one would not know because the problems were the same.  We are dealing with legacy issues, whether it be the Kingsmill massacre; the Miami Showband; individuals such as Terence McKeever; the Ludlow family; or the disappeared, including Captain Robert Nairac or, as I have mentioned before at meetings of the committee, Eugene Simons and Gerard Evans, of whose disappearance very close to where I live I am intimately aware.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan and others can speak about the Dundalk, Monaghan and Dublin bombings.  The reality is, judging from my engagement with the people affected and many others who have come before the committee, they hear the talk but want us to walk the walk.  What the delegates have said very eloquently encapsulates an awful lot.  I think Ms Thompson said she speaks to the Governments.  We are being asked to put whatever pressure we can on the Department of Justice and Equality and other Departments, but I do not think it is a question of exerting pressure.  The document will help to clear the air and deal with the lack of faith in the systems, North and South, on I commend Ms Thompson.<\/p> <p>  I refer, in particular, to the issue raised by Ms Thompson of the legacy of the past in the context of justice and truth and specifically an amnesty, an issue which has been discussed in the past few minutes.  My experience which is not necessary the same as that of Ms Thompson is that people just want closure, regardless of whether it means looking for a court case and a conviction.  In the main, I have found that all people want is the truth.  Ms Thompson referred to mental health and the trauma suffered.  In the case of many of the incidents with which I have dealt, whether they involve individuals or larger numbers, it is beyond belief that people are still suffering.  We all grieve, but we do not do so when we do not know why somebody suffered.  I become slightly emotional when I talk about this issue.  Again, having lived on the Border and seen the trauma suffered on both sides, I do not care who the people are; they are entitled to a conclusion.<\/p> <p>  I suppose I am making statements more than asking questions, but Ms Thompson has issued a report which, as I said, needs to be properly circulated.  I was a member of a local authority for 25 years and have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for almost four.  We have received promises, but the day for promises from both sides is over.  How can we, collectively, get people to realise the legacy issues probably have the most impact in bringing about closure to what has gone on on this island for far too long?  The delegates are talking to us; we are talking to the Department and meeting people, yet there does not seem to be any joined-up thinking.  We can blame either side, but, ultimately, the administration, be it from a Southern, Northern or British perspective, needs to put its foot on the accelerator to bring about closure, be it for good or bad, for the families of the victims.  It cannot just be soundbites.  I meet people daily.  I have mentioned the Ludlow family others who say all we do here is talk.

If I walked past Mr. Bracknell outside and did not speak to him, I apologise.  I thank Ms Thompson for her opening remarks.<\/p><p> There is a lot in here.  The witnesses have spoken about meeting representatives of the Government and the Department of foreign affairs.  Have they met with the Taoiseach or Deputy Coveney?  If the policy is going to change it is people like that who are going to have to change it.  At what level have they met with people within the Government?  It is important that they are brought into the process.  I agree with Deputies Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan and Breathnach that there is a lot of common sense in what the witnesses have said.  We would appreciate that change in policy.  There are victims right across these islands and survivors.  While the Dublin-Monaghan bombings understandably get a lot of attention, there were bombings in Cavan as well and families bereaved and children who died as a result of that.  The pain of those families is the exact same as that of Jonathan Parry.  Anybody who has lost a loved one knows what it feels like to be a victim.  To that end is there any progress on the definition?  As to the recent revelations around some of what happened in the North and the impact on victims, could the witnesses talk about how people are feeling as a result of that?  It is interesting what they say about the Government using redaction on the grounds of national security.  We have long held that view.  I have been to coroners&rsquo; courts for inquests where it is clear that that is happening.  When we talk about the financial cost of inquests, they would not be as expensive if the British Government did not spend as much money trying to keep the truth from the families.  After more than 25 years we recently had the case of the Mallon family finally get to the inquest stage.  The coroner basically said that no evidence of collusion was found.  In his opening remarks he described the litany of attempts that were made to either destroy that evidence or to hide it.  So while no evidence was found understandably because it was all gotten rid of, there was a family who came through the inquest after decades of waiting only to feel probably worse than they did before they went into it.  So there is an awful lot of pain and hurt out there.  I recognise that.  We have all been through the conflict.   I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 as a result of it so there are a lot of damaged people out there.  I am glad that mental health featured so heavily in the report.  We have to look at the wider societal issues, the impact that we have, both on prescribed drugs, on suicide rates and all of that.  There is still an awful lot of hurt.  If it is not tackled and dealt with properly then that hurt will continue to be generational and that pain will be felt for years to come.  I thank the witnesses for coming and for giving us their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019041100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554937200,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>Transgenerational trauma is starting to get a degree of traction in so far as people are actually acknowledging that it is happening now.  Dramatic events that happened within families have not been talked about for years then suddenly a grandparent dies and it all comes back to people and they have that opportunity to talk where they had not talked before.  We have to be very cognisant of what is actually happening there.  We often hear regarding the likes of mental health and the health budget for the North, that it has to be an line with health budgets within the other parts of the UK.  That takes away from the fact that we actually went through 25 to 30 years of conflict.  One can call it a conflict or the Troubles.  To me it does not matter what one calls it.  At the end of the day it was an abnormal way of living for 25 to 30 years.  Therefore, that has to have a knock-on effect.  We have to acknowledge that knock-on effect.  Whether that is putting money into the regional trauma network which I think is the best way of moving forward.  We have had discussions with the people who are doing that.  Sorry, when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I meant within the victims&rsquo; forum.  From that perspective that has to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  As regards getting the Governments involved, unfortunately Deputy Breathnach is right - a lot of people pay lip service to these issues.  That is not good enough because it is actually something that has impacted massively on people&rsquo;s lives, whether they live south of the Border or north of the Border or as I said earlier, whether they live in Great Britain. It is not about money.  It should not be about money.   If money needs to be found to build a nuclear power station it can be found.  If it needs to be found to fight a war somewhere it can be found.  For me personally that is not an issue.  What is important is that we actually start to deal with this.  It is 21 years on as everyone said yesterday from the Good Friday Agreement.  We do not have many opportunities left.  We have gone through numerous different consultations, Eames-Bradley and even before that.  There is nothing new in the Stormont House Agreement proposals that were not in Eames-Bradley.  We lost ten to 12 years there.  We have to do it now.  I do not want to make this personal, but my mother is 86 years of age.  Thank God she is in the fullness of her health but there are other people who are not.  We cannot allow this to drag on for another generation.  I do want my children having to deal with what I have dealt with.  I know I am personalising that but I am only personalising it to make that point that we should not allow this to move on to another generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019041100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Bracknell"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1123,"content":"<p>It was only when Martina was talking it brought home to me that I attended the play in Belfast.

We should not always look to the criminal justice system because in most jurisdictions the criminal justice system has not worked for people.  It has definitely not worked for people regarding the Troubles or the conflict.

Thank you so much.  The work that you are doing is phenomenal.  With this committee I went up to the Ballymurphy inquest.  I have to be honest, what I saw that day was one of the most moving experiences I have ever had.   When families were there in the court they were hearing testimonies and the emotion really impacted on all of the committee that were there that day.  It impacted us all so much.  Alan spoke about how a play can tell stories.  That for me told the reality of the story.  I actually believe that day I saw healing for the families.  That is what really moved me .  For the next generation, for the children of those families and the healing for them even though some of them were not even alive it has a meaning for their brothers and fathers.<\/p><p>It was so moving.  That is the reality of the situation for the families, for the victims and the survivors.  I totally agree with Michelle when she says everybody has been impacted in some way.  I would have travelled up during the conflict as a child going through Belfast up to Antrim.  To go from Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s and to see the British army there is scary for a child.  People had to live in that environment.  That is the reality of living in a war environment.  Everybody has to be impacted by that, never knowing what is going to happen next.  Is a bomb going to go off?  Is there going to be a shooting?  Nobody knew so one is living in that PTSD environment and the impact of that.  That does come down through the generations.  There is no doubt about it.  We know of the huge number of suicides.  It has to be a priority.  If only the reality was out there from both Governments that this should be a priority, this has to be a priority because it will break that intergenerational trauma.  It will save money.  It will save the health service money.  It will save the mental health services money if they could just look at this whole issue and how important it is.  The witnesses have given a fantastic presentation today.  It was very clear.  They do great work.  We want to do our best to support them.  We are constantly having these discussions.

The Commission for the retrieval of the disappeared is doing its very best.    However, without people coming forward with that information the issue of people not having closure remains.

It is acknowledging that something happened to someone.  Unfortunately not everyone will get the inquest or that level of acknowledgement and that public level of acknowledgement.  That does not mean to say that there should not be mechanisms put in place by both Governments that attempt to get that level of acknowledgement.  That is where the investigative body has the opportunity of actually looking at it and saying that if a family wants to engage with that sort of process, it is there for them.  Everything that can be done will be done to ensure that whatever information is available can be given to the families.  There are obviously the other mechanisms there as well.  The oral history archive gives the opportunity for families to tell their story and to document in some way what actually happened to the individual - who the individual was.  That is what gets lost in an awful lot of this &ndash; you are just another figure, you are just another statistic.  Unfortunately we talk about the 3,700 deaths but we do not talk about who those individuals were at times.  What is important out of any of this process is that we remember who those individuals were.  It is not just the people who died in high-profile incidents or who can campaign and have the power to campaign.  Everyone should be remembered.  There are lots of lost victims so to speak - people who are sitting at home very quietly who have massive issues.  They are the people that we need to be reaching out to.  That is what this whole process, the Stormont House Agreement legislation, all of that should be about reaching out to those individuals who have not come forward to date, who have unanswered questions.  The only way that can be done is if both Governments are prepared to grab the bull by the horns and actually do something positive about it, as opposed to just paying lip-service, which seems to be where it is at at the minute.  We met with the NIO a number of weeks ago.  It is still collating its response to the consultation.  How long does this go on?

I will not go through the strategy for the rental sector or why we propose to regulate this area of the tourism market and will instead speak directly to the amendments.  The substantive amendment is amendment No. 182.  This amendment proposes the insertion of a new section 3A into the Planning and Development Act 2000 and it consists of a number of important provisions.  I propose to briefly outline these provisions, along with the related consequential amendments in the group, and then explain their overall intended effect.<\/p><p>Subsection (1) of new section 3A provides that the short-term letting of a house in a rent pressure zone, RPZ, is a material change of use in the house, thereby requiring planning permission, unless otherwise specifically exempted from this requirement.  Subsection (2) provides me, as Minister, with specific regulation making powers that will enable planning authorities to require persons involved in short-term letting in RPZs to provide specified information to their local planning authority.  Subsection (3) is closely related to subsection (2) and provides that the contravention of a requirement of such regulations will be an offence, subject to a summary fine of up to &euro;5,000, which is a class A offence.  Subsection (4) is important as it clarifies that the new provisions, which are focused on short-term letting, as defined, will not affect short-term lettings outside rent pressure zones and long-term lettings within rent pressure zones.  Subsection (5), which is central in understanding the core framework principles underpinning these proposals, sets out the necessary definitions for both short-term letting and rent pressures zones.  In this regard, &quot;short-term letting&quot; means the letting of a house or part of a house for any period not exceeding 14 days, while &quot;rent pressures zones&quot; means any area designated by me, as Minister, as a rent pressure zone under section 24A or 24B of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 188 are all consequential and technical amendments relating to the substantive short-term letting provisions I have just outlined.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 188 is a technical amendment to the Long Title of the Bill inserting a reference to short-term letting and the planning code.  The other two amendments to section 1 of the Bill are also technical in nature.  Amendment No. 1 amends the collective citation for the Residential Tenancies Act to exclude these short-term letting provisions from that Act, while amendment No. 2 inserts a collective citation for the Planning and Development Acts to include these new provisions.<\/p><p>I can discuss in greater detail the reasons for making these changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#D01200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining the amendments.

This committee has argued for some time for the need to have good quality regulations of the short-term letting sector, not only because of the housing crisis but also because it is the proper thing to do for the sector overall to protect guests, hosts and the wider rental market.<\/p> <p>  I will set out my understanding of the Minister's amendments so that he may correct me if I am wrong on anything.  It is very important that people, whether currently engaged in short-term letting or interested in the issue, are very clear about what the amendments do.  I also have three very specific questions. <\/p> <p>  It is good that the legislation makes it very clear that these regulations apply only within the rent pressure zones.  Notwithstanding my criticism of the rent pressure zones, many of us have received representations from those who have short-term letting properties in tourist areas outside the rent pressure zones who were unsure where they fell.  It is important to be clear that if we pass these new rules, they will apply only in the rent pressure zones.  For those people who are engaged in peer-to-peer home sharing, either a room or an entire property, but for less than 90 days, there is really no change.  They will not have to apply for planning permission and they will have to do little beyond what they are currently doing.  Those who engage in peer-to-peer home sharing for more than 90 days will have to apply for planning permission.  While it is not in the legislation it is in the note which the Minister provided to the committee.  It is worth putting on the record that they would then be subject to a planning application.  Those planning fees are in the order of a few hundred euro, depending on the size of the property.  If it is their principal private residence, they will not be liable for water charges as commercial businesses are, so there is minimal cost involved, with the exception of the initial planning permission, whereas those who operate short-term lettings from second properties will have to apply for planning permission, and will be subject to commercial water charges as well as the planning permission requirement.  That is my understanding and I ask the Minister to correct me if I am mistaken on anything.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#E00700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1161,"content":"<p>No, that is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#E00800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>I refer to amendment No. 188 which relates to 14 days.  Let us take the example of someone with a house in Dublin.  They live in the house but their job takes them out of the country for three months in the year, which would not be an unusual arrangement.  Currently, for those three months, that person short-term lets the property to one, two or three hosts for the three months.  It is not a property that is available to the private rental market or that could have long-term letting but it can be used for short-term letting for those three months.  My one fear about the 14 days is that whereas today that homeowner can rent out their property as a short-term let to one guest for three months continuously, when this new regime comes in they will have to apply for planning permission.  One would expect that they would get it because it is not a property that could enter the rental market but they would then be restricted to only allowing a guest to stay for a maximum of 14 nights.  They could let it out for more than 90 days but it could not be to the same person for more than 14 nights.  This was the issue which arose previously at the briefing.  Will the Minister clarify if that is the case?  If it is, we need to look at some way of amending that.  If I get planning permission to allow me to rent out my property on a short let basis for three or four months of the year when I am not there because I am working abroad, it should make no difference whether it is let out continuousy to the same person for that period or to different people.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the current rules for planning enforcement.  If someone is in breach of planning permission today, and I make a complaint to the local authority, the local authority investigates.  However, if the breach was committed seven years ago there is essentially a statute of limitations, it is past and no action can be taken.  Deputy Pat Casey and myself have asked about this previously.  If the legislation as proposed is passed, and I had been engaged in short-term letting for eight years, can I circumvent the new rules because of the seven year statute of limitations that currently exists?  Clearly, there will not be a large number of those because short-term letting has become much more prevalent in recent years, but it is a concern that people could circumvent the new rules if they could prove they were trading for more than seven years as short-term lets.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Minister is linking the short-term letting regulations to the rent pressure zones.  However, many members of the committee believe this sector should be regulated anyway.  When the rent pressure zones expire, and a sunset clause is built into them, does that mean these regulations automatically fall?  If the Government of the day was of a mind to keep the regulations, it would have to amend the legislation at that stage.  Has any thought been given to that?  While the initial impetus for us discussing the short-term letting was the rental crisis, this sector needs to be regulated, just like the private rental sector or the commercial rental sector.  What is the Minister's view on what will happen in relation to the amendments he proposes today when the RPZs expire?    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#E00900","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1163,"content":"<p>Those are good questions.  On the example of someone whose employment might take them out of the country for three months, they will be able to do up to 90 days without there being any problem for them because that will be allowed for the principal private residence, or if they wish, they could get involved in executive letting.  That can be handier than having to manage people coming in every three days.  People hire people to manage that as well but it does not prohibit them from having one person continuously for the 90 days.  That will be okay.

Even though we are changing the planning law now, if someone has established use over a seven year period and can prove that, under our planning laws that is an established use, we cannot go after them for enforcement purposes.  We believe that will be a relatively small number in the scheme of things but it is something we cannot change because that seven year period is hardwired into our planning laws.  However it speaks to the Deputy's third point which has also been raised by Deputy Casey several times in relation to the effective regulation of this sector.  <\/p> <p>  I am responsible for the planning Acts and can restrict the use of people's properties for short-term letting to get those properties back into use in the traditional rental market.<\/p><p>Since this version of the shared economy is disrupting traditional activities in so many ways when it comes to letting, it needs to be regulated.  This is a matter for the tourism authorities because it is a tourism activity.  I would have liked to have addressed both aspects at the same time.  That has not been possible.  I am proceeding with what I can control, namely, the planning Acts.  This will be good and we will do some good work but the Deputy is absolutely correct that if rent pressure zones fall away at the end of 2021, the measure in question will fall away also so the then Government will have to choose either to extend the period of application of the zones, in which case the measure will be extended, or to extend the measure in a way that does not link it to rent pressure zones.  It is my desire that, by that point, we will have moved to regulate the short-term letting sector as an element of the tourism economy.  That is how I see this going.  That is where it needs to go and that is what has happened in other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#E01600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>I have a supplementary question.

Is the Minister absolutely sure that the seven-year exemption would apply if those concerned could prove they were trading?

I said I felt short-term letting was having an impact on the rental market.  I acknowledge, having come from the tourism industry, that the industry itself needs a certain amount of short-term letting.  A holistic approach is needed.<\/p> <p>  I do not know how many times I have spoken about short-term lettings.  I have spoken about this during private session, including today.  I am not disputing that the planning regulations are required but I feel the process is cumbersome and will bog down the planners in the local authorities.  At the first private meeting, I would look for clarification on what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, that is, that when one establishes use for seven years, there is nothing the local authority can do about it.  One can then continue to use the property in that way.<\/p> <p>  Trying to find the properties in question and identify whether they have been in use for seven years will consume local authority time.  That is why I always felt we needed the measure in question but the more important regulatory aspect concerns the short-term letting platform.  I understand it is not in the Minister's brief but, in the longer term, the only way we can regulate the short-term letting platform is through the regulation of the platforms rather than through regulating property owners letting out their properties.<\/p> <p>  I have a few more points.  We are now saying that anybody who applies for planning permission for short-term rental of a property in a rent pressure zone will not get permission.  I come from the tourism sector so I am addressing both sides.  Within Dublin, there is a need for a certain amount of short-term letting for the tourism sector, but not to the extent evident at the moment.  Who decides the percentage and why somebody should be allowed to engage in short-term letting through a platform?<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister acknowledge my point that this is cumbersome legislation and that enforcement is expensive?  Through the regulation of the platforms, we could have controlled this more easily and quickly.  We could simply have stated, in the regulation on short-term letting platforms, that one cannot put a property on the platform unless one has a licence from one's local authority stating one has planning permission.  This would be instead of going through the cumbersome process of trying to prove the existence of unauthorised development in the face of owners saying they have been engaged in short-term letting for seven years.  We will end up going backwards and forwards.  We will end up with legal arguments and clogging up the whole system.  I suggest regulating short-term letting and stipulating in a regulation that one cannot put a property on a platform unless one has a licence from one's local authority stating one is approved.  This would be in addition to the planning process, which would not be ignored.  It would be a lot easier than using up resources of local authorities across every county involved.  We will end up with appeals and in courts and just get bogged down.  We will not achieve the success we all want to achieve.<\/p> <p>  Many in my constituency and the tourism sector were worried.  I acknowledge that this measure applies only to the rent pressure zones.  We must acknowledge that, even within those zones, the tourism sector will require a percentage for short-term lettings.  I refer to the old tradition of bed and breakfast, B&amp;B.  We are dealing with the modern version of what used to be a B&amp;B years ago.  How will a planner in Dublin City Council decide a certain property is really needed for tourism and is not having an impact?  Who will get the good news and the bad news?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#F00500","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1175,"content":"<p>To make a high-level point, we have to try to regulate the sector.  It is important that we do.  I have always said that going at it through the planning Acts is not perfect but it is a good approach.  It is necessary even if one is talking about regulating the sector in addition.  I will come back to why it is necessary.<\/p> <p>  Let us be very clear that this change will not affect those outside rent pressure zones.  If someone is engaged in short-term letting in Kerry, they may continue to do so because it is not a rent pressure zone.  Holiday homes will not be covered, as I stated.  The holiday home element of the tourism industry will not be affected by these changes.<\/p> <p>  Regulations are needed and are coming.  They are needed for a host of reasons, not just in connection with the number of properties available to rent in a city such as Dublin.  We have recently seen issues associated with hidden cameras.  Hoteliers will tell one about people staying in a home-share or short-term let not having the same rights or protections in law and not being assured of the same standards.  They will make all those points themselves.  They all lend themselves to a type of regulation of short-term letting that I agree with.  I use the platforms in question when I travel and have been open about that.  They are now a big part of our economy and the sector will grow.  I refer not only to letting but to other areas where the shared economy is now making inroads and disrupting traditional business models.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the practicality, I acknowledge that this will require more resources for planning authorities because we are asking them to take on a new function.  We are going to provide them with the resources to do that.  The activity is very transparent because the platforms are public.  That is how it works.  It cannot work unless it is very transparent.  It is very easy to ascertain, through public searching, what is going on in a given property.  Residents all know the short-term letting house on their road.  They see people coming in at certain times of the day or leaving at certain times of the night.  They will have the wheelie-case.  I do not believe it is a hidden activity.  It is happening right in front of us and that is why I believe regulation will not be as difficult as trying to discover whether someone's extension three roads into an estate actually complies with planning permission guidelines.<\/p><p>This will have an impact on the tourism industry in Dublin.  However, some short-term letting will continue because we have purpose built short-term letting accommodation.  A place in Temple Bar was built for that reason and got planning permission to do that.  There are also thousands more hotel beds being built.  The tourism industry is incredibly strong in this country and in Dublin, and if there is some displacement effect it is probably okay if it means people go to parts of the country outside Dublin to holiday and spend money.  While I am a member of the Government my responsibility is for housing.  We have a shortage in housing supply so I aim to use every tool available to me to get as many homes back into the traditional rental stock as I can.  That is what we are trying to do through the planning law.<\/p><p> This is enabling legislation.  The meat of it is in the guidelines which we will lay before the House and discuss shortly.  These changes give a mechanism in primary legislation, as we have a vehicle in the rent Bill, to allow us to get to the nub of what we are trying to do.  They will do the heavy lifting.  In the type of regulation the Deputy referred to he still discussed planning permission, regardless of whether he meant to do that.  When we go to regulation of short-term letting platforms it will still require some element of the planning system.  When we looked at what other cities have done, that has been used in some instances.  In an ideal world we would have both the changes to the planning law that I am proposing today and also regulation that would do more than just regulate the number of properties but would regulate how these properties are used.  At present, that type of regulation is left to the platforms.  Rights in terms of whether there was a breach of the agreement a person had in letting the property over a weekend fall to be remediated by the company, but there probably should be more robust regulations in law so people have rights outside of what the company says are their rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#F00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>Is there any communication with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the regulation of short-term letting platforms?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#G00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>There has been extensive communication between both Departments as to what must happen here in respect of tourist activity.

There is a wait of 21 days before they become law.  As a result of the delay, and I indicated this earlier, we are now looking at 1 July next for these becoming law.  It was previously indicated in October that it would be 1 June but to be fair to everyone there must be a period, once the law is passed, in which we can tell everyone in rent pressure zones that this change is coming.  Anybody who is in this sector knows this is happening.  I doubt that anybody can claim not to know, but to be fair I have pushed the date back by a month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#G00900","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1185,"content":"<p>I have questions about the 14 days.

However, people can holiday for a week and sometimes two weeks.  By going to 14 days we are preventing that activity from happening.  There are a number of other types of short-term stays which we would not wish to exclude, such as executive letting.  A company might control a couple of properties where the executives let them out.  A person coming to work in the company might arrive there and use it as a base for a number of weeks before he or she finds a home to rent for a year or two.  We also know from talking to people in the Department of Health that if somebody is undergoing a particular type of surgery, the person might have family come to live near the hospital where it is taking place.  The family might do that for three weeks, a month or longer.  We do not wish to exclude that.  Obviously, there is also the situation, which was flagged to us by the RTB, where somebody renovating a property might have to vacate it for a month or a longer period of time.  That must be allowed to occur.<\/p> <p>  The 14 days allows us to tackle short-term letting as we do not believe people are short-term letting for 15, 16  or 17 days, and if they are it must be 0.01% of activity, but it does not then unintentionally capture all those other lettings we want to allow to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#G01100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>My next question is about areas outside the rent pressure zones.

Does the Minister envisage problems in urban areas that are not in rent pressure zones but in which there is still a great deal of competition for rental properties, there is still a difficulty for people to rent privately and there is a shortage of accommodation?  I am thinking of the rest of Limerick, Waterford and other large towns around the country as well as places just outside the rent pressure zone in Dublin and neighbouring counties.  There could still be issues with a lack of available, affordable rental properties in those areas.

We had to link it to something that was already evidence of significant pressure on rents and significant demand on accommodation, which is the rent pressure zones.  That is already in the law.  We are changing the qualifying criteria for them and doing other things.  We assume there will be more rent pressure zones so places such as Limerick, although I will not prejudge data and everything else-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#G01300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>The Minister should not.

In real terms, however, what decision making autonomy will the local authorities have?  Does the Minister see it, effectively, as a mechanism for a blanket refusal, with the Department saying it does not want the authority to grant any of these permissions?  That is the first question.  The reason I ask it is that within the RPZs in my area of Fingal, there are a number of rural villages where houses are let on a short-term basis for tourism.  Even within that RPZ, there are no pressures in those villages for rent yet they are important for tourism.<\/p><p> The Minister continually mentions Dublin.  Dublin is more than Dublin city, as he knows.  It is important to peripheral areas such as Fingal that people exiting Dublin Airport turn left as opposed to always going into the city for city breaks.  I have received specific representations from people concerned about the application of this provision within an RPZ area where there is no pressure as such on rental supply.  These small operations bring business to rural constituencies in Dublin.  In this regard, does Fingal County Council as the local authority have the autonomy to grant a licence for the short-term letting?  <\/p><p> The Minister mentioned that these regulations will come into effect from 1 July.  I understand the need for an appropriate lead-in period to allow people to get their houses in order.  I accept that we need to regulate short-term letting to ensure properties come back into stock but there are issues with the regulations that we need to do further work on.  Is there sufficient time for people to regularise their situations?  For example, in the case of an application made now for permission for a second property let the minimum processing time is eight weeks.  If this law comes into effect from 1 July will this permission be in breach of it?  In other words, having not had sufficient lead-in time in terms of the application, will the person be operating illegally?  If this Bill is passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad in the next couple of weeks and is signed into law by the President on, say, 1 May, is there sufficient time for people to ensure they are not operating illegally through no fault of their own?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#G01800","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>As Minister with responsibility for local government I am either being told to give local authorities more autonomy or to take more functions away from them, depending on the issue.

Likewise, one of the concerns we expressed at this committee - it is contained in the report - relates to the need for the platforms to share that information with Revenue.  Again, it would make Revenue's job much easier in terms of tax compliance.  There is also the issue of platforms, either knowingly or unknowingly, advertising properties that are not in compliance with the law.  The advertising of properties for long-term letting that are substandard and do not meet regulation was debated in the Seanad yesterday.  We have a 90-day planning permission requirement in law.  If I am a host but I do not have planning permission and Airbnb knows that I am now letting my property out for more than 90 days, there should not only be a legal obligation on the host but also on the platform.  It should be sanctioned in cases where it is advertising properties that are not in line with the legislation.  Responsibility for those regulations should rest with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government because they are much more like the regulation of the private rental sector.  I am not seeking that those regulations be inserted into this Bill; that must be done as it is.  The regulations that I would like to see for the platforms have to be in that kind of space, and responsibility in that regard should lie with the Minister's Department.<\/p> <p>  Even in the context of an almost blanket refusal for non-principle residences in Dublin, a huge administrative burden will be placed on Dublin City Council and other councils.  I know that some organising work is already under way.  What information can the Minister provide in order to assure us that the local authorities, which will have to deal with this very significant administrative burden, will have all of the resources they need to deal with the applications so that there will be no delay?  Have additional resources been assigned?  Have the local authorities asked for additional resources?  Can the Minister share that information?  He announced last September that this would commence in June .  Is that still his intention, or does he now intend to alter the timeline given the delay in bringing forward the legislation today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#J01600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's point about regulating the platforms.  If a company publishes content, it is responsible for that content.  If it is advertising something, it is, within specific parameters, responsible for that advertisement.  It might be difficult to find the person responsible for putting up fake photos, for example.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill in the Seanad speaks to that point.  We want to work through that to see how we can improve matters.  I do not disagree on that point at all.  I took a very comprehensive look at this when I came into the Department because it was one of the things we wanted to move quickly on.  If I could do more in terms of bringing the platforms in I would have done it, but this is a responsibility that will fall to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or perhaps the Department of Finance if the Deputy's suggestion about sharing information with Revenue is taken further.  Regularising the platforms is not something I can do.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the administrative burden that local authorities will bear, we have been kicking around a couple of different ideas.  Dublin City Council developed its own proposals and did its own thinking on this.  Greater clarity will be available when we discuss this matter next week, because we will be talking about the substance of how this will be done in each local authority area.  This will become legally operable from 1 July for people in this sector, as I said earlier in public session, representing a move of one month compared to what was announced.  Anyone doing this as a business activity knows that this is coming.  This is being done to be absolutely certain that we can provide a period of advertising to make the requirements in rent pressure zones clear.  Rent pressure zones are only being finalised in legislation now, and this is where it is going to apply and where it is going to happen.  There can be no excuses for non-compliance from 1 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#J01700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I am probably repeating myself, but we have to find the balance between tourism needs and the needs of the rental sector.

There are very few hotels in that area.  Even the hotel in the Wicklow town has been closed.  My hotel is in Glendalough, but it is the only significant hotel accommodation in my local electoral area.  Glendalough is the honeypot that keeps Wicklow going, and the tourism sector there requires Airbnb properties.  There are many such properties, and in Wicklow town, where there is now no hotel, they are the only option and the only way tourism can be sustained in the immediate future.<\/p> <p>  A developer in Wicklow County Council looking at the county development plan policy, which clearly states an aim to support tourism, will see an immediate contradiction.

Amendment No. 3 and related Government amendments amend the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016 to provide for its relevant obligations and rights to apply to tenancy and licence agreements in student-specific accommodation provided by public educational institutions or by private accommodation providers to both part-time and full-time students.  For example, the 4% per annum rent increase restriction in rent pressure zones, relevant termination provisions, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, dispute resolution procedures, tenancy and licence registration requirements, and the new RTB sanctioning regime for improper conduct will apply to the student-specific accommodation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 amends section 3 of the Act of 2004.  Section 3 of the Act of 2004 sets out the dwellings, under tenancy, to which the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016 apply.  Amendment No. 3 extends the application of the Acts to student-specific accommodation let under a tenancy that commences not earlier than one month after the commencement of this section of the Bill.<\/p><p>Under the proposed new section (3)(1A)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Act, every dwelling situated in a building or part of a building used for the sole purpose of providing residential accommodation under tenancy to students during academic terms will be covered by the Acts, regardless of whether that building is used for any other purpose outside of academic terms, such students can reside in the building outside of academic terms, or anyone other than a student, such as a caretaker, resides in the building provided, the residence in the building is for the purposes of providing residential accommodation to students during academic term times.  The amendment makes clear that the Acts do not apply to such a dwelling where an individual landlord resides, for example, in &quot;digs&quot;.  Generally, the Act does not apply to a dwelling within which the landlord also resides.  Under the proposed new section (3)(1A)(<i>b<\/i>), it is made clear that the application of the Acts to the student-specific accommodation sector will not affect regular dwellings, such as a house, where students reside under an existing or future tenancy.  Under the proposed new section (3)(1A)(<i>c<\/i>), the definition of &quot;dwelling&quot; under section 4 of the Act of 2004 is modified to make clear that student-specific accommodation can be self-contained but need not be self-contained.  This modification is necessary to reflect the nature of student-specific accommodation.<\/p><p>Under the proposed new section (3)(1A)(<i>d<\/i>), &quot;student&quot; is defined as a person registered as a student with relevant providers within the meaning of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.  To be clear, as defined in other legislation, &quot;relevant provider&quot; is a &quot;previously established university&quot;, &quot;an educational institution established as a university under section 9 of the Act of 1997&quot;, &quot;a technological university&quot;, &quot;the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland&quot;, &quot;the Dublin Institute of Technology&quot;, &quot;a provider whose programme of education and training is validated under section 45&quot;, an &quot;awarding body under section 48&quot;, &quot;a provider to whom authority to make an award has been delegated under section 53&quot;, or &quot;a provider who is authorised to use the international education mark under section 61 other than a provider who is so authorised where that provider is also (<i>i<\/i>)<i><\/i>a provider referred to in paragraphs (<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>g<\/i>), or (<i>ii<\/i>) a linked provider&quot;.  The term &quot;student&quot; covers part-time and full-time students.  English language education providers are not currently &quot;relevant providers&quot; under section 2 but will soon become relevant providers under the law.  Accordingly, their students who avail of student-specific accommodation under licence or tenancy will fall within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Acts.<\/p><p>A new subsection (7) is inserted into section 3 of the Act of 2004 to disapply a number of provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts which are not appropriate to the student-specific sector.  The provisions disapplied from the student-specific accommodation sector include the following.  Section 16(k) is not relevant to student-specific accommodation tenancies as assignment and subletting is prohibited in that sector.  Section 16(n) is not relevant in the context of student-specific accommodation as a student has his or her own separate agreement with the provider.  Accordingly, a scenario cannot arise where the student is obliged to write to the provider notifying of the identity of residents.  Section 78(2) and (3) are not relevant in the context of student-specific accommodation as a student is prohibited from subletting or creating a sublicence.  Section 135, clause (II) of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (e) of subsection (4), is amended to modify the required content of the statement that issues by the RTB with its acknowledgement of an application to register a tenancy or licence in the student-specific accommodation sector.  That RTB statement will not be required to set out the security of tenure provisions under the Residential Tenancies Acts, as Part 4 does not apply in the student-specific accommodation sector.  Simply put, a student residing under tenancy in student-specific accommodation for longer than six months will not accrue the legal right to stay there for another 5.5 years.  The RTB statement will reflect that.<\/p><p>Sections 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 185 and 186 will not apply to the student-specific accommodation as subletting and multiple tenancies do not apply in that sector.  The agreement between a student and a provider is made in the student&rsquo;s personal capacity.  Section 195 will not apply in the student-specific accommodation sector as proposed overholding under a fixed term tenancy cannot arise.  Students are required to vacate student-specific accommodation in accordance with the terms agreed with the provider.  Security of tenure provisions under Part 4 of the Act will not apply.  Schedule 1 of the Act does not apply to student-specific accommodation as subtenancies cannot occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#L00700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1258,"content":"<p>I fully support this amendment as it is very significant, particularly for the thousands of students throughout the country who have engaged with all members of this committee and the Department.

Are there any nuances as to what applies to purpose-built accommodation that is either on or off campus?  Is there any difference?  We will wholeheartedly support the insertion of this section into the Act.  It is crucial that this legislation is passed so it can be in effect before the new college year starts in August and September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#L00800","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1259,"content":"<p>It is worth noting it was almost a year ago this month that students from Dublin City University's Shanowen Court and then those in C&uacute;irt na Coiribe were hit with those 27% rent increases.  Like Deputy O'Brien, I pay tribute to the students who organised and mobilised on that issue.  They held sleep-outs and they protested in their colleges and here at Leinster House.  They met Deputies from almost all parties.  It is those students and their political activity that forced it on the agenda of this committee.  There was good bipartisan work by a range of members to put it on the Minister's agenda, and I acknowledge the Minister's openness in working out with those of us on the committee the best possible way of ensuring these students can be fully protected, particularly from excessive rent hikes.<\/p><p>It is a good example of what happens when young people become involved in politics, engage with the political system and politicians put aside party political differences and do the right thing.  When we pass the Bill, it will have a very beneficial impact on students in both private sector, purpose-built student accommodation and on-campus accommodation.<\/p><p> The Residential Tenancies Act is highly complex, which we knew when we were drafting our legislation.  The departmental staff have proposed good amendments that deal with the complexities of the Act well.  I wish to ask some clarifying questions in order that we will all be clear on the record.  Despite the word \"tenancy\" being used at the beginning of amendment No. 3, Part 4 of the Act, which concerns tenancy rights, will not apply in this case.  Student accommodation providers and students will continue to operate under licensing arrangements but they will protected by, for example, the rent pressure zones and other aspects of the Residential Tenancies Act which have not been excluded.<\/p><p> Yesterday, I had a good meeting with the Irish Universities Association, which manages approximately 15,000 units of on-campus accommodation, that is, bed spaces of accommodation.  It was a constructive engagement and the representatives were trying to get their heads around the Bill.  They asked a couple of questions, in respect of which I am interested in hearing responses.  Given that part of the universities' financing model to ensure that the student accommodation stacks up is what they do outside of term time, such as lettings for academic conferences and so on, none of that will change as a result of the Bill.  It purely governs the licensing arrangements with students for the purposes of student accommodation.  I assume, although the Minister might clarify, that the short-term letting regulations that we are passing will not have any impact on the bed spaces in the on-campus student-specific accommodation.  That is something we need to think about.  If it will have an impact, and if there are any issues with it, we might have to address that on Report Stage or when the Bill proceeds to the Seanad.  If it will not, it would be helpful if that were clarified.<\/p><p> An issue that arises for the university sector, as well as for the approved housing body sector, which we will address at a later stage, is the requirement that universities will have after the Bill is enacted to register those licences, or what are referred to as \"tenancies\" in the amendment.  Will the Minister provide some clarity on the requirement of the private and the university student-specific accommodation providers for registration, the cost thereof and the benefits of registering multiple tenancies at a discounted rate?  Was there was any consideration for treating universities like approved housing bodies, given that they are registered charities, and allowing them the lower rate of the registration fee, or was there a reason which prevented that?<\/p><p> My final question might be better directed at the RTB.  There is an administrative burden for student accommodation providers and the RTB.  Given that there are 15,000 bed spaces but that the leases are not necessarily all for nine months, as some will be for three or six months, will the Minister briefly talk us through his conversations with the RTB on how to minimise the administrative burden for both the providers and the RTB in order that bed spaces can be turned over as smoothly as possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#L00900","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1261,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the amendments and thank the Minister and his staff for providing a great deal of detail in the various amendments.

In any event, I do not think any of us will want to push our own amendments because we want there to be a solution.  I pay tribute to the Union of Students in Ireland and the various student bodies, particularly that of Dublin City University, which travelled to the gates of Leinster House and raised the issue with us, following which much work has been done.  Students find it hard enough to manage and live, without being subjected to excessive rents, and the amendment will certainly ease the burden for them.<\/p> <p>  On the timing, I agree with Deputy Darragh O'Brien that the sooner we pass the Bill, the better, particularly as the new term will start in September or October.  In that regard, I am sure the students' unions will spread the message.  It is important that nobody signs up in advance to something above what is allowed given that people's rights will be protected when the legislation is enacted.  That probably cannot happen but the Minister might provide clarity in order to ensure that people do not end being covered by the legislation.

These amendments to section 15 of the Bill are required on foot of the application of the Act to the student-specific accommodation sector.  The opportunity has been taken to better refine the text of section 137 of the 2004 Act.  The key changes are as follows.

The current registration fee is &euro;90 upon commencement of the tenancy.  The RTB will continue to have the power under section 138(1) of the Act to vary the registration fee in line with changes in the value of money.  The new section 137(1)(<i>b<\/i>) provides that the registration fee for the tenancy in the student-specific accommodation sector will be &euro;40 immediately from the application of the Act of 2004 to that sector, which is likely to predate the move to annual registration.  The registration fee relating to that sector will remain at &euro;40 following the general move to annual registration.<\/p><p>Section 137(4) of the 2004 Act, which deals with the single registration fee that applies where a landlord simultaneously applies to register up to ten tenancies in dwellings comprising the same property, for example, up to ten apartments in the same apartment block, is also amended.  In line with section 15 of the Bill, following the move to annual registration, the single registration fee payable in such circumstances will be &euro;170 both upon tenancy commencement and upon subsequent annual registrations.  The amendment applies a single fee for tenancy registrations in respect of student-specific accommodation tenancy registrations in such circumstances but immediately from the date of the application of the Act of 2004 to that sector.  As I have stated, this is likely to predate the general move to annual registration.  The single fee for tenancy registrations in such circumstances will not change for the student-specific sector upon the move to annual registration.<\/p><p>Government amendment No. 80 gets into late registration, which we might come to separately.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P01800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1351,"content":"<p>Are there any comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P01900","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1352,"content":"<p>Is this amendment about registration fees?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P02000","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P02100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>I saw something from the Irish Council for Social Housing regarding its concern about AHBs having to pay registration fees, given that they are not for profit and are largely publicly funded, and the financial burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P02200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>I think we will come to that a bit later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P02300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1356,"content":"<p>That is a later one - okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P02400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1357,"content":"<p>So the AHB piece is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P02500","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1358,"content":"<p>That is under Government amendment No. 82.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#P02600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1359,"content":"<p>That is fine.

The Bill amends the existing AHB registration fee to reflect the new requirement to register tenancies on an annual basis.  The Bill provides that an AHB tenancy registration fee will be just half the usual amount payable by private landlords.  These amendments to section 16 of the Bill propose to better refine the text of section 137A of the Act.  The key changes are as follows.  Section 137(1) of the Act is amended to provide that following the move to annual registration, a fee of &euro;20 will apply to a tenancy registration upon commencement and on an annual basis thereafter.

Under section 137A(7) of the Act, an overall cap of &euro;240 applies to the fee payable by an AHB to register a tenancy.

I share the genuine concerns raised with me by the Irish Council for Social Housing on behalf of the approved housing bodies regarding the additional administrative work that will be required under the section.  I am not convinced that it will be as simple as pressing a button every year to renew the registration.  On the additional penalties for failing to re-register, a single registration should be required and perhaps the tenancy should be rolled on every five years, as was previously the case.  I do not agree with the proposed new section in its current form.  I understand the reasons for which the Minister may be proposing it, but I do not believe annual registration is required.<\/p><p>Obviously, there is a re-registration when a tenancy changes.  If a tenant of an approved housing body moves on, the tenancy will be re-registered.  AHBs are not-for-profit organisations which play a big part in the delivery of housing.  We should not make it any more difficult for them to operate in the sector.  From my experience as a Deputy and spokesperson on housing, it is not the approved housing bodies as landlords, <i>per se<\/i>, that are posing any of the difficulties we are trying to address within the Bill.  For that reason, the section may be unnecessary.  I am interested to hear the response of the Minister in that regard.  I will not flatly refuse to support the amendment but I would like to know how he thinks it would work for an organisation such as Cl&uacute;id, Tuath, any of the other big AHBs, or the smaller AHBs that are willing to get into the market.  There are currently approximately 260 AHBs in Ireland.  I am interested to hear the comments of the Minister.  I ask him to expand on why he and the Government believe that an annual registration for the sector is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#Q00600","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1375,"content":"<p>This was one of the sections of the Bill as originally presented.  I was torn on the amendment.  I am very sympathetic to the approved housing bodies, which have communicated with all members regarding the financial and administrative impact on them.  However, I have listened very carefully to the Residential Tenancies Board regarding the need for accurate annual information such that we can fully understand what is going on in the sector.  The reason I have decided to side with the RTB and the Minister on this issue is that even though a tenancy may be long term, the details of the tenancy such as the rent paid or the number of people per household may change, and that is very important information for us to have.  I would like that information to be readily available for the entire social housing sector, not just the approved housing body sector.  I will be supporting the amendment.<\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge that the Minister has made a concession to the approved housing body sector.  In the vast majority of cases, the cost of the annual registration will be &euro;8.50 rather than &euro;20, which is a significant reduction.<\/p> <p>  There are two issues on which I share the concerns of Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  The first is that the administrative process must be very straightforward.  I have spoken to the RTB on this issue and it outlined that, for example, in the case of a long-term social housing tenant there would be a detailed registration in year 1 and one could simply resubmit electronically with the click of a button on its online portal each year thereafter.  Unless there was a material change, all of the data would not have to be inputted again.  That is vital.  The approved housing body sector works down to the bone of the administrative margin it is given and we must insist that the process is made as easy as possible for the sector. <\/p> <p>  Another concern is that although the five or six large approved housing bodies have the capacity to deal with this measure, the many very small approved housing bodies, including some that built five or ten units in their local villages which are now managed by pensioners, may not have that capacity.  They are not professional organisations and it will be a significant struggle to make them aware of and have full understanding and knowledge of this issue.  There may be difficulties in terms of how the requirements are communicated, the engagement with the AHBs and in terms of the penalties.  I am thinking of a local Society of St. Vincent de Paul conference with three units in a small rural town, the governance of which is not at the level of that in the larger approved housing bodies.  Serious thought must be given to engaging with such bodies and ensuring that they do not end up in very difficult situations through no fault of their own.  I am not currently proposing an amendment to deal with that issue, but it is a matter on which the Minister should respond to the committee today or revert to it having consulted with the RTB and the Irish Council of Social Housing.  To use a phrase of which the Minister is fond, we must ensure that there are no unintended consequences for such very small voluntary approved housing bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#Q00700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1376,"content":"<p>I see the logic in having as much up-to-date information as possible about all tenancies, including those of AHBs.  I understand that that is presumably the consideration of the Minister and echoed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  However I have very serious concerns about the administrative capacity of approved housing bodies to deal with the proposed requirements.  The extra burden under the new section would dovetail with substantial additional burdens that are being placed generally on AHBs large and small.<\/p> <p>  In the past week or two, I came across a concrete example of how ill-equipped approved housing bodies are to deal with welfare issues, anti-social issues and complaints and so on about the quality of the accommodation.  The case to which I refer arose in a new approved housing body development in my area that came in under Part V.  AHBs do not have the administrative resources to deal with those issues.  This amendment would place a further administrative burden upon them.  Although I see the logic behind the amendment, I point out to the Minister that there is a real difficulty.  A general burden is being imposed on AHBs and they simply are not capable of dealing with it.  This amendment would add to that burden.  The inability of the AHBs to cope with the administrative burden will become more and more apparent because of the over-reliance on AHBs.<\/p> <p>  I do not understand what is the logic or criteria when deciding to give responsibility to develop a Part V social housing project to an AHB rather than the county council, which has more administrative capacity to deal with these issues.  The decisions seem completely arbitrary.  In my area, much of the Part V development seems to be going to AHBs, which do not have the capacity to cope.  This amendment will add to their burden.  I am raising a wider issue but it needs to be flagged.  Notwithstanding that there is a rationale for the amendment, it will add to the administrative burden on AHBs.  I would be interested to hear the comments of the Minister in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#Q00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1377,"content":"<p>I share the concerns that have been expressed already on the capacity of the AHB sector to deal with this.  I support those who have said it has to be as simple as possible to reregister.  There was a time when Limerick County Council encouraged the small AHBs in villages to provide for elderly people with crescent-shaped places for the elderly in the village to live in and to receive support.  There are many such AHBs around the country but I do not know what management capacity they have.  I imagine that the bigger ones have better capacity.  I would like there to be a hand-holding approach, rather than a punitive approach, in cases where there are difficulties.  This may prove to be something that people will not succeed in complying with , even with the best will in the world.  The sector provides long-term homes for a large section of our population and when people get a tenancy from an AHB, they see it as their home for the rest of their life.  It is not like the volatile private rented sector, though we would also like people to think they could live in a privately rented place for the rest of their life.  I accept that there are efforts to deal with the financial cost and the administrative burden but my main suggestion is that there is understanding of the sector in respect of the difficulties it will undoubtedly have.  I am aware that this may not be possible in legislation but it is important that it is as easy as possible to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#R00100","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>The AHBs will register their first tenancy with the RTB and all tenancies are registered.  They will also make an annual return to the interim housing regulator.  I disagree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that larger housing bodies will automatically have the resources.  The projected cost of the new measures, and the additional annual requirements, is approximately &euro;500,000, which is &euro;5 million over ten years and is significant for a not-for-profit sector.  It is not as if these are not tracked or registered as things stand.  This is not the sector we were going to focus on as, to the best of my knowledge, it is a compliant sector and does not tend to generate many complaints.  The tenants are long-term tenants in the main, and 12-month roll-over leases are rare.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, these housing bodies seem to be the main vehicle for delivery of housing in the sector and we do not look for local authorities to register tenants annually.  AHB tenancies are effectively the same as they involve Cl&uacute;id, their tenants are on council waiting lists and they are housed in co-operation with the local authorities but we are considering placing a significant burden on them with this.  The market rent aspects of the legislation do not apply to the AHB sector so why do we need to have annual registration?  Would it not make sense to require them to make an initial registration and to reregister if there is a change of tenant or every five or seven years?   If we are not proceeding with the rent transparency register, capturing details for publication and to get a better picture of the situation is not relevant.  We will be placing a substantial financial burden on the sector.  There will be a need for extra resources and this will lead to extra costs.  St. Vincent de Paul Housing Trust in Malahide has small developments in the town and in Wexford.  Who will do the registration for them?  The Minister is also proposing doubling down on them by imposing penalties on what is a not-for-profit sector.

We are building a new piece of technology with the RTB for everything it does and we have stressed that we have to facilitate easy annual registration for everyone, particular for AHBs which often do not have a dedicated person to do this and which do not make the profits which a private landlord would make.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the need for the register to be consistent and complete.  As the Deputy knows, when one starts to interfere with different datasets and to have different application periods or time periods, it can skew information and not give an accurate picture.

AHBs have to use the dispute mechanisms of the RTB when they have problems with tenants and an independent arbiter has to decide on the matter, and tenants also use the RTB for this purpose.  There needs to be a fee because the RTB needs to be funded in that way as well as through central Government, recognising the burden on the board of disputes between AHBs and their tenants.<\/p> <p>  These are very positive changes for AHBs because, under the current law, it costs &euro;90 to register a tenancy.  The current law exposes them to a liability of an additional &euro;375 if they are late in making a registration but from this point on, it will be &euro;8.50 per tenancy, which will be payable once a year.  I do not see that as overly burdensome from a financial point of view.  I recognise the issues from an administrative point of view and I have met with tier 1 AHBs in my own constituency who have made that point to me.  They stressed that they are volunteers and need things like a new freezer for a kitchen and they also have tax compliance requirements.  We are working with the RTB to make sure that reregistration is as simple as possible.  If the system is coherent it will be simple but if we start building a system that has to cater for different things in different ways, simplicity is not achieved and it becomes more burdensome and costly.  In light of the changes in the wider rental sector and the changes we are bringing in for the RTB, we see this as a positive change for AHBs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#R01100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1388,"content":"<p>As I said at the outset, the Minister has a point.<\/p><p>However, it is indisputable that approved housing bodies, AHBs, do not have the administrative resources that are available to local authorities.

While those who can afford these extra costs might just find them tedious or an annoyance or inconvenience, key money is a real concern, poses a material obstacle to accessing housing and introduces further discrimination on the basis of wealth into the already stressful process of searching for housing.

I would, of course, rather that he did that and we had a national rent deposit scheme in place now.  It is the one thing that is going to safeguard deposits into the future.  We should, therefore, be working collectively towards getting that established.<\/p> <p>  My amendment states that the Minister will report back on the establishment of a national rent deposit scheme within 12 months of the commencement of the legislation.  I think that is absolutely reasonable.  I would like to have gone further.  I would like to see the scheme established now.  I understand, however, that there are reasons why that cannot be done.  We should not, however, just leave this on the never-never and the long finger.  It is something we want to do in future.  My amendment would mean that, when the Bill is passed, there would need to be a report back in 12 months on a plan to establish a national rent deposit scheme.  That will help and it will underpin a resolution of all of the issues about which my colleagues have spoken during this meeting.  I refer in particular to Deputy Catherine Martin's point on the level of rent.  One month's rent should be more than sufficient as a deposit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#V00700","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1433,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Darragh O'Brien's amendment.

There would, therefore, also be a financial return for the RTB, as well as a reduction in its administrative burden.  I know it is beyond the scope of this legislation.

I have lost my deposit before in circumstances I thought were absolutely incredible.  When I saw the dispute options open to me, I felt the burden of pursuing them was not going to be worth the money I was trying to retrieve.  I have also been in a situation where I have used a deposit to cover my final monthly rent payment.  People like to have the flexibility to do that as well.  There is a commitment to bring in a deposit protection scheme.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is absolutely right that the 2015 Act provides for this to happen.  I have been examining this matter since I came into this brief because it is something we committed to and that it is possible to achieve in law.<\/p> <p>  Some difficulties have arisen, however, that were not there in 2015.  There have also been some changes in the landscape.  One is that it was originally intended that this would be financed by the interest payable on the deposits in the scheme.  The ECB has stated, however, that it is going to continue with a zero rate for the foreseeable future.  The interest on even a large amount of money would not, therefore, be enough to cover the management and maintenance of this scheme, its operation and the administration required.   We need to consider the numbers of tenants and the amount of money involved.  A change in the market means that disputes about deposits are no longer commonly referred to the RTB.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of the two-month deposit, I do not have a problem with defining a deposit as generally being one month.  It is not something significant according to the RTB, however, nor is \"key money\".  There was much reportage on these issues at the time.  Threshold stated that it was a disgrace and should not have been happening.  It had to withdraw that statement the next day because the evidence brought to Threshold had not been actual evidence of people being charged to view properties.  There has been some misreporting on this in the media.  That is not to say that it does not happen.  When we look at all of the different things we are asking the RTB to do, however, including the new things it will be doing - and we have given it money and resources to do those tasks - we have to be careful about the additional burdens we ask of the RTB.  It may not see those issues as being foremost priorities.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the size of a deposit protection scheme, we are looking at more than &euro;300 million according to a back-of-the-napkin estimate.  It is estimated at about &euro;340 million and rising.  That is a significant amount of money that needs to be managed and held.  Where would it be held?  Who would manage it?  Under what terms would the moneys be released?  What would be the different dispute mechanisms needed for mediation?  We would need all of those things.  It is not a simple thing to do.  It is a great idea but it is complex.  That is not to say that it is not something we should proceed with but it is not being presented to me as the priority it once was.  Given everything else we are asking the RTB to do, we are not proceeding with that aspect in our Bill.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments brought forward by the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#V00900","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1435,"content":"<p>The Minister is not accepting amendment No. 8 despite there being no definition of deposit.  That is regrettable.  There is a housing crisis so should address anything that is locking anyone out of even the possibility of viewing a home.  There is also the issue of a two or three month's rent being requested as a deposit.  I am hearing about those issues in my constituency in Dublin-Rathdown.  I am being contacted by people who cannot even view a home because of the \"key money\" fee and by people who cannot afford the deposit because it is two or three month's rent.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this again before the Bill goes on to Report Stage rather than give an outright refusal now.  \"Key money\" fees and two or three month's rent being required for a deposit is essentially facilitating discrimination on the grounds of wealth.  There should be no discrimination and there should be equality when accessing houses.  Allowing a landlord to state it is necessary to have a deposit of two or three month's rent or to have key money to even see a home is locking people out of housing when we are in the midst of a housing crisis.

It is something that could affect the other aspects of the Bill.  There is obviously a reason.  In respect of our own amendment, I understand that there could be a cost implication and I understand about deposit interest rates being zero at the moment.  No one is suggesting that within the creation of a national rent deposit scheme there would not be an administrative fee for holding a safe deposit.  It should be possible for the Department to come back to that in a report.  All we are asking for is that we do not leave this indefinitely just because it is thought to be complex and costly or because it is this, that and the other.  The Department should say it is going to come back within 12 months and lay out the options.  Maybe one of the findings will be that it is not actually required and we do not need to do it.  I encourage the Minister to accept amendment No. 183 on that basis.  It does not tie his hands or tell him to do anything, with the exception of coming back here within 12 months to tell us where things stand.  There is an issue with security of deposits as rents get higher.  We all want to tackle driving down rents or at least seeing the inflationary nature of rents reducing.  A deposit is a substantial fee.  All we are asking is for a provision to come back in 12 months to report on the options for a national rent deposit scheme.  If administrative cost is the issue, if I was lodging &euro;2,000 with a landlord for my deposit, we could look at an administrative fee as part of that, to at least know the deposit is secure.  We continue to hear complaints.  It is interesting to hear that there has been a reduction in the number of complaints to the RTB about deposits.  That is welcome.  However, we will all still be very aware of these issues when they arise within our own constituencies.  In the main it is the landlord who holds the deposit.  The landlord can then withhold the deposit and all those complaints go to the RTB.  They take up a lot of time.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that there is a saving here.  There could be a saving to the RTB in respect of time expended dealing with complaints around deposits.  I do not wish to be obstructionist but I intend to press amendment No. 183.  It makes sense.

More generally, beyond this immediate crisis, we need for those who enter into the rental sector to understand that the people who rent from them have rights and require security of tenancy.  We often talk about having a rental sector that is more like the European model.  Various people say we have to accept there will be a bigger rental sector in Ireland.  It seems to me that we cannot do that unless we change fundamentally the nature of the private rental sector to the effect that those who get involved in the business of renting out property understand that this is not just something they can flit into and flit out of again, treat tenants with contempt, disregard the impact of their actions on tenants or leave them high and dry.<\/p><p>It speaks for itself.  I do not see why renovation or substantial refurbishment should be a ground for eviction.  I refer to the example I am familiar with, as it is staring me in the face every day across the road from my constituency clinic on Main Street, D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This is a loophole speculators and property investors are constantly trying to utilise.  We need to close it down.  If someone needs to renovate a place, it does not mean the tenants have to leave.  They can be housed somewhere else for a while.  Indeed, one of the points we made when they were trying to evict tenants from that particular development was that they had a couple of empty places anyway and there was no reason they could not undertake the refurbishments and move tenants around as they did so within the same development.  That is what they should do.  Landlords need to have a responsibility to tenants and understand tenants have a right to long-term secure tenancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#W01900","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>The in-and-out problem the Deputy raised, which exists where people are coming in to make some money and then getting out of rental accommodation is exactly why we need more institutional investors making a long-term play for 20 or 25 years who come in to make a gain from rent roll rather than capital appreciation.  Getting in for capital appreciation and treating a second property as a pension fund is what leads to someone all of a sudden getting a notice to quit because the landlord has reached a particular time in his or her life.  Such volatility has damaged the rental sector in the past.  Moving to a more mature rental sector involves doing the kind of things that we are doing in this legislation.<\/p> <p>  This amendment is not about whether substantial refurbishment can be cited as a grounds for a notice to quit.  That is allowed and elsewhere in the Bill there is a good definition of that.  This is about when property has to be vacated because refurbishment works are being carried out and the amendment states that they will not have to pay rent in that circumstance.  That is an unnecessary provision to insert in section 16 of the Act.  That is for the landlord and the tenant to agree.  It is often the case that another form of accommodation is provided, if the tenant so wishes.  It also might be provided for a rent-free period as well.  If the parties cannot agree to a temporary vacation of the premises on such terms, there is a breakdown in the relationship and if the works are substantial according to the definition that we have in the Act, section 34 can be invoked.

We have discussed both at length and I am not looking to open up the debate but just to make the case briefly.  The issue of vacant possession notice to quit is significant and everybody knows why.  Amendment No. 50 seeks to remove sale of property as a ground for issuing a termination notice.  At some point we have to move to a rental market where properties are rental properties just like in the commercial rental market.  While we should allow landlords to sell their properties, they should sell with the tenancy intact and as a going concern rather than the current situation.  The Minister has spoken on several occasions about the need to professionalise the landlord sector and move towards the kind of sector that exists in other European countries.  This is the norm in many of those countries in that kind of rental market and, therefore, it makes eminent sense.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, amendment No. 51 seeks to remove the use of a family member as a ground for termination of tenancy.  If a person has a rental property in a rental market, the notion that it is acceptable in the current climate to evict one family to house members of his or her extended family is problematic.  I understand where it comes from and I understand the consequences but these are both necessary as we professionalise and improve our rental market into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#Y01200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1492,"content":"<p>I shall speak to both amendments and to the wider points as well but I do not want to repeat myself.  In terms of the debate we have been having about vacant possession or tenants <i>in situ<\/i>and removing this part of the Bill, the advice I have received is that it is not constitutional.  Further advice I received was that, even if it were constitutional, it would not be retrospective so it would not protect people in existing tenancies.  That is the legal picture.<\/p><p>There are also significant risks from a policy point of view.  For example, we understand there would be a devaluing of the sale price of the property by between 20% and 30%.  If we were working in a pure market where one landlord is selling to the other because one is selling its rent roll to the other, that would all make sense but that is not happening in our market at the moment.  Given the recent history of the housing market, it could lower the sale price of that property by 20% or 30%, not the profit on the sale but the actual sale price of the property which, if someone is coming out of negative equity or trying to settle a debt with a lender, is in financial dire straits or needs the money for something very serious, would be an unfair attack on them.  Furthermore, also as a policy consideration, if we decided we did not care about that and were going to proceed no matter what harm it might to the do the individual selling the property, a new couple buying the home would have to serve a notice to quit.  What if the people do not leave in those circumstances?  This young couple is paying a mortgage that is no doubt very expensive and is also paying rent, not living in the property, and going through the stress of having to deal with what would then be an eviction, not a notice to quit.  Given those policy considerations, it is not a good idea.  I do believe, however, that many of the changes we are making to section 34 as a whole, which we did work on - the Taoiseach and I engaged on several occasions with the leading NGOs - will strengthen protection for tenants and make an impact.  Of course once they have had time to settle, we will look at them again to see the impact they have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#Y01300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1493,"content":"<p>I have not seen the legal opinion so I cannot comment on that.  Given that the restriction applies to commercial rentals, it has to be legally possible, whether retrospectively or not, to apply the same rule to new tenancies.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the impact, it is not that I do not care about the impact on the property owner but, to use a phrase that the Minister and his predecessor always like to use, we need to strike a balance between the rights of the landlord and those of the tenant.<\/p> <p>  Vacant possession and notice to quit are the leading forms of family homelessness.  They account for 70% according to Focus Ireland, less according to the RTB so there is another side to this equation of what happens to those families.  There is also a significant cost to the State because if a family spends between six and 24 months, or more, in emergency accommodation that costs.  While I understand the argument about the loss, whether as a percentage of the profits or of the overall value of the house, there is also a loss to the taxpayer from not taking action, whether this or something else.  <\/p> <p>  I know I am not going to convince the Minister to change his mind.  There is nothing bar an extension of the notice period, which we will come to later, for those families currently subject to vacant possession or notice to quit and I urge him, as I did during the Second Stage debate on our legislation, to consider that issue.  He is engaging with the NGOs to find some way to tackle the issue of reducing the flow of families into homelessness.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister to look at that issue, as I did during the Second Stage debate on our legislation.

If he does and it is positive, he will certainty receive the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Of itself, extending the notice period will not protect those families who either have a vacant possession notice to quit today or will imminently get one.  I accept that it gives them a little more time to find a place, but it does not stem the flow of families into the homeless system or into being at risk of homelessness. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#Y01400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1495,"content":"<p>While I understand motives behind the amendment, I agree with the Minister on this.  This will have a consequence for the market that could be even more detrimental and cause a further flight of landlords.  I have problems with institutional landlords, particularly with some of the funds and banks that have entered the market.  A Minister for Justice and Equality in the previous Government, Mr. Alan Shatter, passed the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 and made a commitment to examine the requirement for vacant possession, particularly in instances where investment properties were taken over by banks or lenders.  That is a big issue for people.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank, in its report for the final quarter of 2018, indicated that approximately 15,000 mortgages were in grave difficulty and could reach the point where banks and institutions would move on them.  In some circumstances, these institutions serve notices to quit and then rent out the properties again to newer tenants.  They put them back on the market.  The suggestion of Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett, to simply ban any sale of a property unless it is sold with a tenant, would not work.  Most people know it would not work, as was proven in the Committee Stage debates on the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018.  Having said that, the Deputies have highlighted that this is a real issue, as has my party.  Does the Minister envisage an alternative approach being taken, albeit not as part of this Bill?  What is his view on that?  Most people who fall into homelessness do so via the private rental sector.  We moved an amendment to a previous Bill which would oblige a financial institution to take on the roles and responsibilities of a landlord once it takes over a residential investment property.  That is a tack that could be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#Z00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1496,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies.  I will start with the last point.  In our engagements with this committee, non-governmental organisations and others we try to see if a targeted intervention could make a difference.  On refinement, the NGO amendment focused solely on institutional investors.  That captures buy-to-let properties and, as we know, the buy-to-let market is not like a traditional institutional investor market in this country, for reasons I will not go into.  Constitutionally, that was regarded as an unjust attack on a subset of people to address a wider societal problem, one with far greater complexity than might be captured in just one change or an imposition on just one subgroup.<\/p> <p>  On institutional investors and vacant possession, in cases where these investors have obtained vacant possession, we are trying to get those properties before they go to the market and bring them into the social housing stock.  That is being led by the Housing Agency, working with various lenders.  There is a rolling fund that allows for that approach.<\/p> <p>  Going back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, I note there are much longer-term leases in the commercial sector.  Notices to quit cannot break a lease agreement.  If a tenant enters into a five-year lease with a landlord, a notice to quit served because a family member wants to live in the property cannot break that lease.  We do not have long leases in the residential sector because, in my view, there is no taxation structure that incentivises them.  There is such a structure on the commercial side.  I would like to have a taxation system that incentivises longer-term leases.  That would provide greater security for tenants without risking a flight of providers of rental accommodation from the market.  These are other matters that we are considering.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to get into a Second Stage debate on these issues.  However, there is a correlation between the number of people entering homelessness or emergency accommodation from the private rental sector and the reasons given.  We are trying to establish the extent of that correlation because that also has an impact on legal advice and other matters.

Currently, all Part 4 tenancies in Ireland, which are most private tenancies, must be renewed after six years or four years if one is in the property before 2016.  Part 4 tenancies generally automatically continue and are considered rolling tenancies in terms of the amount of notice the landlord must give the tenant to vacate the property.  However, when a Part 4 period comes to an end there is a window for the landlord to evict a tenant for no reason under section 34(b), a power which amendment No. 44 deletes.  Rebuilding Ireland contains a commitment to move towards indefinite tenancies and our amendment simply places that in legislation.  The time for doing so is long past.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 refer to eviction due to sale of buy-to-let or investment properties.  It is simply unnecessary to allow eviction on the grounds of sale.  It should not be happening.  In European countries with established private rental sectors with strong security of tenure sale is not permitted as a ground to evict.  The same is even true in the UK, which has a similar private rented sector legislative structure to ours.

That was always our position and, while I liked the version in the original Bill on account of it being so restrictive, we have to deal with the amendments in front of us.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of technical questions.  The criteria for an extension are straightforward and they seem sensible.  The creation of an extra room has to be within existing building regulations but one could imagine a person subdividing one room into two and, so long as the two rooms met the regulations for adequate room size, the work constituting substantial refurbishment, even though the financial cost of subdividing a room into two would not be very significant.  How can the Minister satisfy the committee that the provision cannot be abused?<\/p><p>I share Deputy Boyd Barrett's concern about the building energy rating, BER.  Anything that incentivises and pushes landlords to raise BERs is important.  It is a minimal cost to improve from the lowest grades.  If something is already at a high grade, going up a point or two might not necessarily cost a significant sum.  I like the principle of finding a mechanism but I am not sure what the Minister has is adequate.  I do not have a better option for him but it is something that he could look at between now and Report Stage.<\/p><p> This gets tricky when it relates to changes in internal layout.  What kind of guidance will be given to the RTB or to the local authority to make it clear what kinds of changes would fall within this proposal?  Likewise with adaptation works, it is a very general proposition.  If there are substantial renovation works to assist disability adaptability, that is really good but it could include a relatively minimal level of change, such as ramps and rails, which would raise a question.<\/p><p> All of these works we are talking about already enable landlords to write off the capital costs against their tax liabilities, albeit at 12.5% over a year.  I am not proposing this but I know that Deputy Casey had a good discussion with the Minister at a previous meeting about a financial threshold.  Working a financial threshold into legislation is very clumsy and I am not proposing that but I think for any of us to justify a threshold to excuse somebody from the rent pressure zones, it has to be over and above the ordinary renovations one would expect landlords to be doing, which they can write off against their tax liability anyway.<\/p><p> I am not opposed in principle to what the Minister is proposing but there is a lot of convincing to be done that what is currently in front of us is tight enough not to open up another area of abuse.

A number of different documents will have to be lodged to prove the landlord has done it.  I understand the concerns about whether a landlord might address just the BER or the layout.  A combination of three of the four factors I laid out would have to be accomplished, or a 25% extension to the floor space.  I understand the point about the BER jumping by two points.  What if a landlord was doing something significant that was not disability adaptation, but changed the layout, added an extra room and went up by a BER grade, but could not go up by three points because it might take the property beyond A1 or maybe to A1, which might not be seen as necessary and the landlord might not want to incur the costs?  If it were just two points on the BER scale, if it is coming from a low BER, simple insulation in the attic might address that and I would be concerned about it.<\/p> <p>  The RTB issued guidance about what it would consider to be a change of layout, renovation and such.  I will refer to that briefly.  When we talk about a change of layout or structural alteration, those include attic conversion, garage conversion, the change of a ground floor bedroom to improve the layout of a property and so on.  We are not talking about changing tiles on the floors but about the movement of walls to create rooms.  An example I gave earlier is turning a garage into living space, whether a bedroom, a playroom, a living room or even a kitchen.  That is significant work.  We talked about some of the investments that might be made to improve the BER.  Attic insulation is not very expensive but cavity wall or dry lining can be, as can external wall insulation.  Maybe the boiler, the pipework, the radiators or the cylinder are being replaced or maybe one is doing the windows and doors.  Those types of investment are expensive but we are not asking for them to be done on their own.  They have to meet three of the four criteria or a 25% extension.  They then have to have surveyors and architects sign off and give documentation to the RTB which will then adjudicate and state that the clause has been invoked in the right way.<\/p> <p>  We think it is a vast improvement on not having a definition.  We came with a definition because the committee looked for a definition.  In the conversations we have had at the committee about the previous definition, some of the problems we and others saw in the definition were highlighted, and we have now come with what we think is a more robust definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#QQ00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1598,"content":"<p>I take the point that it is an improvement and the Minister is genuinely trying to put in safeguards.

Some of these works can be carried out without affecting the tenant, especially when it comes to the building energy rating, BER.  Many of us have lived in our homes when we have had major renovation works carried out and there was no issue.  By adding the financial limit to it, along with listing the works that are permitted, it simplifies it a bit.  We seem to get very technical in everything we are doing instead of saying that we can increase the energy efficiency, improve disability access, improve wiring and so on, but it must have a certain minimum value.  That was the general opinion I felt at the time, and while the Minister said it was not operational, the home incentive scheme has worked very well in the sense that every contractor who is doing it has to be tax compliant and they have to go through the processing, log it online, and away they go.

Government amendment No. 84 technically amends the new section 148S of the Act, which is being inserted by section 18 of the Bill.  This is a technical amendment to legally provide territorial jurisdiction to the District Court for the purposes of making court orders to generally enforce compliance with the requirements of an authorised officer under the new RTB sanctioning regime.  Government Amendment No. 85 is a consequential technical amendment.  <\/p><p>The Government cannot support amendment No. 136, which proposes to delete the new section 148Z, which provides for a right to appeal a RTB sanction decision in the Circuit Court and that a RTB sanction decision must be confirmed by the Circuit Court, either on appeal under section 148AA or on foot of direct application, on notice to the landlord, for confirmation by the RTB under section 148AB.  The new section 148Z is a central legal requirement to enable the empowerment of the RTB to operate its new administrative sanction regime.  I accept that where court involvement is necessary, the courts process will add to the length of the overall sanctioning process but I am following the advices of the Attorney General on this important legal point.  It is important to point out that a decision to impose a sanction is not a given.  A decision maker can decide not to sanction and court involvement is not then required.  I do wish to stress that on the ground, court involvement need not delay redress for the tenant.  The decision on the nature of a sanction to be handed down takes into account the actions of a landlord after the RTB issues an investigation notice.<\/p><p>For example, under section 148AD in determining the nature of the sanction, the Circuit Court or decision-maker may have regard to, for example, whether the landlord acknowledges the improper conduct, the extent of any failure by the landlord to co-operate with the investigation, any steps taken by the landlord to remediate any loss suffered or costs incurred, the duration of the improper conduct, the recurrence, if any, of the improper conduct, the continuation of the improper conduct after the landlord has been notified of the investigation, the extent and timeliness of any steps to end the improper conduct, any steps taken to remedy the consequences of such conduct, and whether similar improper conduct occurred previously.  There is good scope at the earliest juncture for a landlord to acknowledge and stop the improper conduct and remedy the matter to hand.  The incentive is there to limit the sanction to be imposed.<\/p><p> I also wish to highlight that proceedings need not go all the way to confirmation by the court.  Landlords have a number of opportunities during the process.  For example, section 148W(3) provides that, where a landlord acknowledges improper conduct, the decision-maker shall on receipt of such acknowledgement determine what sanction, if any, is to be imposed.  This provision applies to both tenant complaint initiated and RTB own volition investigations.  Section 148X(4)(a) provides that the decision-maker may, if he or she is satisfied that improper conduct has occurred, impose a sanction on a landlord.  This is an enabling provision.  It does not follow that the decision-maker must impose a sanction, even if improper conduct has occurred.  The decision-maker must continue the sanctioning process only if he or she wants to impose a sanction.  Separately, 148X(4)(c) provides for complaints to be dismissed or for no further action to be taken if the decision-maker is satisfied that no improper conduct has taken place.  Section 148X(5) provides that where an acknowledgement by a landlord is received under 148W(3) as referenced above, the decision-maker may decide to impose a sanction on the landlord as he or she thinks fit in the circumstances of the case.  This implies that the decision-maker is not obliged to impose a sanction.  Under 148Z(2), the decision to impose a sanction requires a Circuit Court confirmation.  The Bill does not provide for court confirmation, however, if the decision is to impose no sanction.  Circuit Court confirmation is legally required to publish the detail of any sanction and to give effect to any sanction.<\/p><p> I will also be moving amendment No. 145 to provide technically territorial jurisdiction to the Circuit Court for the purposes of an appeal by a landlord under section 148AA(1) of a sanction imposed.<\/p><p> The Government cannot support amendment No. 146, which proposes the deletion of the new section 148AB requiring the RTB to apply to the Circuit Court to confirm its sanctioning decision.<\/p><p> I will also be moving amendment No. 150, which concerns the granting of territorial jurisdiction to the Circuit Court to deal with applications made by the RTB under section 148AB(1) and related matters.  Again, this is a legal necessity for the operation of the new RTB administrative sanctioning regime.<\/p><p> Section 168 of Act of 2004 will be amended by amendment No. 175, which inserts a new paragraph (da) into subsection (2) of that section 168.  Subsection (2) of section 168 lists the categories of person to whom a section 168 indemnification can be applied by the RTB.  Amendment No. 175 includes authorised officers and a decision-maker appointed for the purposes of the new RTB sanctioning regime in the list of indemnified persons.<\/p><p> All of the amendments speak to the new sanctioning regime, how it is to be applied, the role of the Circuit Court in that regime, and the different points in time at which the process can come to an end.  The decision-maker may decide that there is nothing to put forward because there was no breach or because the reason the sanction was imposed either has been remediated or compensation has been made to the aggrieved party or both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#VV00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1554937200,"counter":1808,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1809,"content":"<p>At the informal briefing two issues arose.  There were concerns that the timeline of the new process, at its very longest, could be excessively long.  The Minister said he would look at it to see if there was some way of shortening it.  In terms of the amendments tabled here, is it the view of the Minister that those amendments assist us in any way or provide for those concerns?  There was also a concern around the new role of the decision-maker and whether it would lengthen the time required to make a decision.  A suggestion made by a number of members was that decisions on sanctions below a certain amount could be made by the chief executive rather than the decision-maker, or that the decision-maker could make sanctions of a higher order.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 136, which I tabled, contains a drafting error.  I must have had some help from Deputy Darragh O'Brien on that one.  I did not intend to remove the right to appeal to the court, rather I wanted to remove the court confirmation.  I will withdraw the amendment, but I will return the amendment at a later stage on the matter of the court confirmation.  I still hold the view I held at our previous discussion, which is that court confirmation adds a cost and unnecessary delay.  The right to appeal to the court is sufficient, and we will return to that matter on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#WW00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1810,"content":"<p>We discussed this at length previously.  The confirmation of the court cannot be removed if the ultimate outcome is going to be a sanction and the publication of the sanction.  Where there is no compliance or acceptance by the landlord, for example, where he or she has acted offside in some way and does not accept that he or she has acted poorly and wants to take it all the way, it has to go to court.  We looked at this matter with the Attorney General, and it has to stand.  It has to be there at the end of the process if we want to impose the sanction and publish the details.  However, there is an official sanction, which involves going all the way through the process before sanctioning, but the voluntary acceptance of a type of sanction is also possible and can happen at a much earlier date.  When we discussed this previously, it was not clear if, once this investigation had begun, the only way to come to a conclusion that satisfied all parties was to go through the entire process and end up in court.  There are three or four instances in which the process will end based on different outcomes from the investigation.  Mediation is now available in the first 60 days as a possible outcome as part of this regime.  Both parties can be brought together and a solution can be reached which both are happy with.  Another potential ending is if the complaint is not valid, meaning that one would not have to go to the court.  Landlords were worried that they would have to go all the way to court to confirm that a complaint was not valid, but that is not the case.  The landlord, under section 148 and the different subsections I set out, can acknowledge that he or she is in the wrong.  In that case there is no official sanction but there will be some sort of remedy if it is done within the first 40 to 66 or 70 days.<\/p> <p>  If the aggrieved party, for example, the landlord, decides that he or she wants to go further, there is then the possibility of an oral hearing with the investigation report having been given by the authorised officer to the aggrieved party.  A decision might be made then that there has been no improper conduct and that there will be no sanction.  Alternatively, there could still be a settlement if the parties wanted to take that route and such a solution was acceptable to all parties.  Once we go beyond that point, resolution could potentially take some time.  That is a long way of answering the Deputy's question.  We have found ways in which participants can step out of this process at an early stage.  However, if someone refuses to accept that he or she has a liability and one wants to pursue a formal sanction and publication, we will have to go through the Circuit Court confirmation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#WW00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1811,"content":"<p>The shorter processes might involve something like a landlord who is in breach of the rent pressure zones legislation.  If he or she owns up to that and accepts the sanction, he or she can do that.  It is within his or her gift.  The RTB pointed out to us that the real value for it of the new investigative and sanction powers is that if someone is breaching the rent pressure zone legislation, it will be able to move on it very quickly, take the case and win it.  If the landlord drags the process out to the end, its concern is that, given the timelines provided in the original Bill, that process would be significantly longer than the standard process for a comparable adjudication and fine.  The RTB expressed concern about that.  Is it fair to say that, in a case where a landlord is unwilling to accept fault, there is a likelihood that the RTB's concern is a valid one and that some of those cases may take longer than would ordinarily be the case under the current regime?<\/p> <p>  I am still not completely clear about the court confirmation aspect.  The RTB, in its determinations today, can make sanctions and publish those determinations, including the details of landlords.<\/p><p>The sanctions can be very high.  For example, in the case of third-party antisocial behaviour complaints, they are in the tens of thousands of euro.  When we last spoke, the Minister said what is different about this process is that the RTB is doing the investigation, and that is the reason for the sanction.  If we look at the determination process of third-party complaints for antisocial behaviour, the adjudicator is doing an investigation and then making a recommendation to the board.  I accept the two parties get to present and dispute the facts, and all of that.  Obviously, I do not have the benefit of the Attorney General's advice but, essentially, I do not see how the process of this investigation and sanction regime is substantively different from existing adjudications, fines and publications in a way that would warrant this to have a court confirmation where those other determinations and very significant financial fines and publication of details do not warrant court confirmation.  I am not trying to be awkward.  I am genuinely not clear on this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#WW00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1813,"content":"<p>To be clear, I met the RTB specifically on this issue and we went through it.  If we were to take a worst-case scenario on timelines, where it would be necessary to go through the full court confirmation process to level a sanction on someone who was not accepting a liability, then some of those fears of the RTB may be realised in terms of the length of time.  Following that meeting, I went back to the Attorney General and the legal advices to see how we could come at this in a better way so there is not that fear of those lengthy time periods.  What is an improvement in terms of the understanding is there are points at which a person can step out for things like mediation or where a person accepts improper conduct, but it has to be accepted.<\/p> <p>  As it was explained to me, the reason the threshold seems to be high, in terms of having to get Circuit Court confirmation, is because of a combination of the powers that have been granted, whereby the RTB can investigate and can initiate an investigation itself and the sanctioning, which can potentially total &euro;30,000, is higher than what is awarded in other examples under the existing process.  That combination of factors warrants the involvement of the Circuit Court and we have not been able to get around that.  What we would hope is that given the clarity we have provided in law in this Bill, the excuses a landlord might be able to give such as \"I did not know\" and so on, fall away because so many things are being tightened or better defined in this legislation.  We also think that, given the power the RTB will have to deal with this and the amount of money that can be levelled, this will be a deterrent and that landlords will be, if not coerced, then induced to admit liability because it can be so clearly proven by an investigating officer because of the legislation but also because we have these officers coming in on foot of the legislation.  It remains the case that where a landlord is in breach and the RTB has chosen to pursue, the Circuit Court has to be there. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#XX00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1814,"content":"<p>This is only for landlords stepping out of line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019041100002#XX00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1815,"content":"<p>It is related to section 19 offences, which deal with rent increases that are not compliant with the rent restrictions, knowingly furnishing information to the RTB which is false or misleading or failure to notify the RTB when one is availing of an exemption to the rent pressure zone.

The Irish Association of Pension Funds, IAPF, represents pension savers with an aim of ensuring pensions in Ireland are secure, fair and simple.  We are a not-for-profit membership organisation.  Our members are pension schemes set up by employers for their employees, and companies that provide services to those schemes.  The services we provide for our members are representation, education, and information.  In terms of the Bill we are looking at today, we have advocated for some form of debt on employer legislation for quite some time, with correspondence on the issue with the Department as far back as 2008.  In a joint paper with the Society of Actuaries in Ireland, submitted in December 2008, we advocated for some form of debt on employers in order to provide greater security for members of pension schemes, discourage employers from abandoning pension schemes, and to provide greater flexibility in the ongoing funding of schemes.<\/p> <p>  Since 2008, there has been a significant decline in the number of defined benefit schemes and the number of active members, which are employees who are continuing to accrue benefits within those schemes.  As a result of funding issues, many schemes have restructured, often reducing members' benefits and also requiring increased funding from employers.  According to the most recent figures from the Pensions Authority, 126 of 611 defined benefit schemes did not meet the minimum funding standard.  However, in total, the aggregate assets of defined benefit schemes, at &euro;64.1 billion, were higher than the total aggregate liabilities, which were &euro;59 billion.  Schemes that do not meet the minimum funding standard are required to put a funding proposal in place, which is designed to get the schemes back to meeting the standard.  The proposal has to be agreed by the trustees, the employer, and the actuary to the scheme.  If the proposal is for a period longer than three years, it also has to be agreed by the regulator, the Pensions Authority. <\/p> <p>  Defined benefit provision is declining worldwide for many reasons, including cost and fluctuation of cost, accounting practices and changes in work practices.  Ireland is no different in this respect.  That has been reflected in the decline in the number of schemes and active members of schemes, with just over 100,000 active members of private sector defined benefit schemes today.  A concern often raised with this type of legislation, which imposes a contingent debt on employers, is that it may precipitate the closure of schemes in order to avoid its impact.  However, schemes have had plenty of opportunities to close or wind up in recent years, and this legislation has now been under consideration for two years with no evidence of that happening.  It could be argued that the schemes that now remain, therefore, have already decided they are in it for the long term.  It should also be remembered that the rules of the scheme may give trustees the power to request contributions from the employer in a wind-up situation which may have the opportunity to bring funding above the minimum funding standard level. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Moriarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1922,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moriarty for his opening statement.

I know he has time constraints so we will not delay him unduly.  I want to ask a few questions on the documentation we received from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  One of the objections it raised was on wind-ups being delayed as a result of this legislation.  It made a few comments on that, but Mr. Moriarty has already answered the point very effectively about people being forced to wind up.  This has been talked about for the past two years and that has not been reflected.  One of the issues mentioned was that it might disproportionately affect younger members of the scheme, because the scheme would continue while the wind-up was postponed and the retired members would continue to get their entitlements, which might increase the deficit to the ultimate detriment of younger members.  I would like to hear Mr. Moriarty's comments on that.<\/p> <p>  The Oireachtas report also states that there might be some constitutional difficulties about the legislation being possibly retrospective, and it goes on to say that it might force people to wind up before the legislation comes into effect, which seems to be contradictory.  It also mentions that a law like this might put some employers at a competitive disadvantage, and that it might drive some companies into insolvency.  Question were also raised about the first section of the Bill, which deals with appeals, and I might have to modify that, because I do not think I got what I wanted to get, now that I read the section again.  Perhaps Mr. Moriarty could comment on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#C00500","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554937200,"counter":1924,"content":"<p>On younger members, there would need to be a very long delay period, and a lot of people retiring in that period, to fundamentally alter the structure of the scheme.<\/p><p>It may differ from scheme to scheme, but the provision in terms of valuing the benefits for members in wind up is that, as members start to approach retirement, their values get higher than they are when further away from retirement.  It is no longer the sort of cliff edge where there was a huge difference in the value of one's benefits the day before retirement and the day after.  Possibly for some schemes, it may make a difference if there is a member in the scheme who has very large benefits, and there are only a small number of members, but overall I would not see that as a huge issue, unless it is a really long delay where the whole structure of the scheme is fundamentally altered.  I do not see that it could be a significant issue for the vast majority of schemes.<\/p><p> On the constitutional difficulties, the minimum funding standard was introduced by legislation after the Pensions Act came into effect in 1990.  There have been a lot of changes made to that to enhance members' benefits over time, such as preservation of benefits, where once someone has been in a scheme for two years, he or she is entitled to the value if it is kept as a deferred benefit.  There was a time when one could work up to just before retirement, leave the company and get all one's member contributions back.  More recently, there has been the introduction of a risk reserve, which has raised the funding requirements as well.  None of those issues, as I understand it, caused any constitutional difficulties, so I do not see how something like this could either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Moriarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1926,"content":"<p>I would imagine what they were thinking about was that we were imposing changes on pension schemes, which were already in existence.

I am not a lawyer, but when all those changes took place and there were no issues, I could not see why that was the case.  I touched on the forced wind up before it comes into effect.  As I said, this legislation has been discussed for the last two years, and there are other similar Bills.  There has been no experience of a rush to close schemes in that time.  I think that there have been a lot of opportunities for schemes, particularly when there were a lot of funding issues in the middle of an economic crisis.  If there was ever a time for a company to wind up a defined benefit scheme, that would have been it.  I think there is still a lot of employer goodwill towards defined benefit schemes, and a lot of the restructuring that has been done happened in conjunction with trade unions.  People have sat down together and reached solutions, so again, if that was going to happen we would have been seeing evidence of that over the last two years, and there certainly has been none of that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the issue of putting employers at a competitive disadvantage, employers already have to account for defined benefit schemes within their balance sheets, so I am not sure that putting a contingent debt on the employers, from a balance sheet perspective, is going to make any significant difference for most employers.  It is already there, and is already accounted for in their books, so again, I do not see that as a huge problem.  As this is a contingent liability, it is only triggered, and only comes into effect, if the employer is trying to wind up a scheme that is not fully funded.  From an accounting perspective, it is not a real debt, and it is already in the balance sheet in some form anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Moriarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1928,"content":"<p>I do not intend to introduce legislation which is ultimately going to drive some companies into insolvency.

While they might have an issue in that, if they had to, they could not pay all the benefits at once, if they look out over the next 40 years when they are planning to pay benefits, they are perfectly fine from a cashflow perspective.  I can also understand from a regulatory perspective that because there are no protections which force employers to bring schemes up to full funding, and there is no pension protection fund, which would cover an insolvent employer situation, the regulator might be focused on protecting against that worst-case scenario because there are no other triggers and protections in place at the moment.

I think this is a trigger to make that happen, if the governance requirements become so difficult that it forces schemes to do something else.  At the moment, those other options that are available are planned to be changed.  The regulator wants a new regime for regulating and authorising master trusts, which are multi-employer schemes, or one scheme with lots of employers in it, but those provisions are not in place yet.  We also know there are plans to introduce auto-enrolment, where all employers are going to have to put their employees into a pension scheme, and our concern is that, without either of those two options being on the table yet, if a lot of additional requirements are forced on smaller schemes, employers are just going to stop doing anything.

I am accompanied by Mr. Billy Hannigan, national secretary at F&oacute;rsa.<\/p> <p>  Congress is the largest civil society organisation on the island of Ireland, representing in excess of 700,000 workers across the economy.  Congress has been to the fore in highlighting the serious need for radical reform in the area of second-tier pension provision.  That is not least because fewer than half of all workers have an occupational or private pension to supplement their State pension.  A total of 90% of public sector workers do, compared with one in three workers in the private sector.<\/p> <p>  As the State pension is paid at a flat rate rather than being earnings related, workers without a supplementary pension are exposed to a significant drop in their living standards in old age.  Congress represents the great majority of members of defined benefit pension schemes.  Most DB schemes were first established in the collective bargaining process, with trade unions and employers agreeing the terms, rules and benefits of the schemes.  With pension assets plummeting due to the international financial crisis, many DB schemes, already under pressure, fell further into deficit from 2008.  Today, more than 90% of DB plans are closed to new entrants.  However, while in decline, approximately 102,000 pensioners, 111,000 active members and 415,000 deferred members draw, or will draw, retirement income from DB pension schemes.  As such, the DB sector, with assets under management of more than &euro;62 billion, remains a very important part of pension provision.<\/p> <p>  Congress has played a leading role in the attempts to rescue the DB system from the sustainability challenges it faces. We have done that in two ways: first, by negotiating the restructuring of individual schemes and, second, by engaging with the Government to strengthen regulation and oversight so that there is greater protection for workers who are members of private pension schemes.  We had several meeting with the former Minister for Social Protection, now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and we had a general understanding that he was well disposed to legal protection to limit, where possible, DB scheme closures.<\/p> <p>  The publication of the heads of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 confirmed that in several ways: by requiring employers to put forward funding proposals within six months of the actuarial funding certificate, by obliging employers sponsoring DB schemes, whether in deficit or not, to give 12 months' notice of their intention to cease contributions, and by enabling the Pensions Authority to determine a schedule of contributions that will restore to solvency DB schemes which do not meet the funding standing or reserve in circumstances where the employer has failed to engage with the trustees to develop and agree a funding proposal.  To date, however, the Government has failed to legislate for these measures.<\/p> <p>  In February of last year, the Government published an ambitious five-year plan for pension reform, covering the entire pension landscape.  One of the roadmap's six strands focuses exclusively on improving protection for DB pension schemes in the form of more effective regulatory oversight and transparency.  Disappointingly, the action deadlines set out in the roadmap have been missed.<\/p> <p>  Congress therefore welcomes the committee's scrutiny of Deputy O'Dea&rsquo;s Bill and the issues it highlights.  In short, as the committee will be aware, this Bill aims to protect DB scheme members against the risk of employers winding up a scheme.  It proposes to provide an appeals mechanism for members where a scheme is being wound up by the trustees and to make it illegal for a solvent company to wind up a scheme in deficit without consent.  The Bill also proposes to give new powers to the Pensions Authority.<\/p> <p>  This Bill, together with the roadmap, makes clear that there is political consensus that stronger regulation is required to support DB pension schemes and to protect the interests of members of the schemes.  A key weakness with the current regulatory regime is that there are no safeguards to prevent an employer unilaterally deciding to cease making contributions to a scheme or otherwise trigger the wind-up of a scheme.  The consequential unfairness of that has been crystallised in a number of high-profile cases where financially secure employers announced their intention to withdraw their support from a DB pension, putting the pension benefits of members in jeopardy.<\/p> <p>  Congress is aware of some employers' concern that a rebalancing of the regulation of DB schemes will result in a deterioration in the financial standing of firms operating such schemes.  We do not accept that it is an inevitable consequence.  The purpose of what the Government has proposed and what is proposed in this Bill is to ensure that employers are required to enter into discussions with the trustees to address funding issues where they arise.  It is the view of congress that this is entirely reasonable.<\/p> <p>  Congress sees the scrutiny of this Bill as an opportunity to deliver on the political consensus that stronger regulation of DB pension schemes is required so that the hundreds of thousands of active, deferred and retired members of DB pension schemes can rest assured that their interests are protected and that they will get to enjoy the benefits they have accrued over their working lives.  I thank members for their attention.

Dr. Bambrick rightly said the Government's proposals have yet to be legislated for.  Having studied an outline of those proposals, I understand they do not add much to the existing protections.  There is much talk about extra consultation but no compulsion.  We are proposing something stronger involving compulsion.  The unpaid amount of the deficit will be a debt on the company etc.<\/p> <p>  While in the case of a wind-up where there is a statutory provision for distribution of assets, my original intention in drafting section 1 was to provide for cases where there is a reorganisation and benefits are reduced across the board.  At the moment in cases of a reorganisation there is a certain amount of discretion.  I have received representations saying that pensioners have no say in that even though they are often one of the parties adversely affected.  I want to ensure that provided a majority of the overall membership is in favour of looking at what is proposed by the trustees by way of reduction of benefits in the case of a reorganisation, there would be some appeal mechanism which includes pensioners.  I may not have taken the most elegant route to reach that conclusion, but we can redraft it.<\/p> <p>  The Department analysis suggests that something along the lines of what we are proposing would be a disadvantage to younger members because in the case of a scheme which is eventually closed down, if the closure is delayed the present beneficiaries can continue to receive their benefits thereby increasing the overall deficit and this would adversely affect younger members.<\/p> <p>  We also need to guard against driving companies into insolvency.  I have tried to do that to the best of my limited ability by allowing for a lesser payment but not less than 50% or having it payable over a five-year period with ultimately an appeal to the High Court.  Perhaps we could be more flexible there.  Solvency can range from cases where the assets barely exceed the liabilities to very wealthy companies.  A pension deficit can be anything from &euro;50,000 to &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion.  We need to get that balance right.<\/p> <p>  It has also been mentioned that a proposal such as this would put companies at a competitive disadvantage.  They seem to be the main issues raised.

Since this legislation was last in the House and since the Social Welfare Bill 2017 coming from Government, we have seen movement towards auto-enrolment albeit that other milestones are being missed.  Members will agree there is momentum towards auto-enrolment that did not exist in 2017 when this legislation and the other legislation were introduced.<\/p> <p>  While auto-enrolment will not remove the incentive and the unfair competition, it will seriously reduce it.  DB pension contributions will be much higher than what is likely to be required by auto-enrolment.  While there is no current legal obligation for companies to provide a pension, that will soon be addressed.  On competitive disadvantage, auto-enrolment will even the playing field because we would regard most employers with a DB scheme as good employers.  We share the concern that nothing should be done to put those jobs at risk.  While we are eager to have this protection for members of DB schemes, we also want to protect the viability of those jobs.

There is an element of trust in pension schemes, including defined benefit schemes, especially trust in the idea of employees of one company engaging collectively with the scheme, which is probably equally important.<\/p> <p>  We have referred to the danger of people closing schemes because legislation is coming.  I tabled amendments to the Social Welfare Bill 2016 on Report Stage in the Seanad.  Of course, if they had been agreed, it could have been law within ten days.  I know this committee expedited looking at this issue back in 2017 when we did a legal review of that area in the hope that change could have been introduced in the summer of 2017.  It is unfortunate that we have lost two years on the matter.<\/p> <p>  The Bill makes reference to a number of time periods.  I know that Deputy O'Dea is considering a five-year time period.  I like the way the Bill does not simply take a snapshot of a company's finances.<\/p><p>Instead of simply looking at a snapshot of the company right now, it considers whether the company has the capacity to restore itself in the next five years.  That avoids the danger of an outlier moment of artificial depression in company finances perhaps being used to justify the infeasibility of a scheme as a longer period is under examination.  Dr. Bambrick might comment on how that could be used effectively.  There may be scope in terms of members making an appeal.  That also might need a time period because we want to ensure it is not just a technical opportunity for members to lodge an appeal over a bank holiday weekend or something.  Unfortunately, we have seen circumstances where very short notice periods were applied but we would like to ensure there is a reasonable period of notice in this regard.<\/p><p> Will Dr. Bambrick refer to the auto-enrolment schemes?  Is there potential in the Bill or in complementary legislation to deal with situations where companies may wish to move from a defined benefit, DB, scheme to an auto-enrolment scheme?  I mean where companies are bringing in auto-enrolment schemes for their new, current or young employees but have a defined benefit scheme for others.  Will Dr. Bambrick outline what she thinks good legislative practice might look like regarding that transition?  Let me give an example.  If I have been working for five or ten years and only have a certain number of defined benefit contributions that I have made and the scheme is winding up, do I carry that benefit or how does it work?  Does Dr. Bambrick have an outline of what good practice might look like?  Will the DB pension systems run parallel within companies or is there scope for the winding up of one scheme to segue into the other in a situation of transition that did not involve insolvency?  <\/p><p> A roadmap for pensions has been mentioned a number of times.  Without wanting to stray too far, with due respect to the Chair, what we are discussing concerns people who, in good faith have paid into a scheme over their lifetime and expected and planned for a certain level of security in their retirement.  Similarly, in relation to the roadmap for pensions, there are issues at present around the contributory pension which again, people have planned for contributed to and paid in to.  While the transition from 20 years to 30 years' contributions to qualify for the State pension had been signalled for ten years, I refer to the discussion that has taken place around the move to 40 years' contributions in order to qualify for the full State pension.  Might Dr. Bambrick see any parallels for those who have planned and contributed over their working life, only to suddenly find the goalposts moving in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#K00700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554937200,"counter":1967,"content":"<p>I will start with the Senator's last point and work backwards.  The Senator referred to the total contributions, the move from yearly averaging to the total contributions method.  While we thought the original proposal was that 30 qualifying years would be required, we are now looking at 40 qualifying years.  Let me remind members that total contributions is due to come into effect in January 2020.  We are talking about it taking effect in eight months' time.  We have seen very little progress in that.  If that is going to be the new movement, people will have to be informed and know the situation.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has already received messages from people who are nearing retirement and want to know what number of contribution years they will require.  As for those with DB pensions, we think the real difficulty is in the move to the qualifying age with the pension, where in 2021, that is, in 18 months' time people will have to wait until they are 67 years to qualify for the pension.  Arguably anybody who has a defined benefit, DB, pension and is nearing retirement, will be able to start drawing it down from 65 years, if not earlier.  Those pensioners with DB pensions are possibly in the best of the worst-case scenario in that they will have their DB pension to bridge the time between their retirement and the State pension coming into effect.  We would argue that it is the qualifying age is causing the most difficulty for people, rather than the qualifying years of contributions.  People have now had to bridge an extra year, where they might not have a supplementary pension to help them and in 18 months' time, it will be a gap of two years.  With the total contributions approach, we are very surprised that we have not had clarity to date on that so that we would be expecting clarity very soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1968,"content":"<p>On that point, I do not think there will be clarity.

Social insurance coverage was very late coming to Ireland because we did not industrialise until the 1970s.  While we had the requirement to pay social insurance from the mid-1960s, very few people in Ireland were working in insurable employment.  People who are coming into pension age will find it very difficult to have 40 years of contributions.  If one was self-employed, one did not need to pay a contribution until 1991.  If a self-employed person is due to retire next year in 2020, it is not possible for the person to have 40 years of contributions.  If one was working part-time, one only had to pay a social insurance contribution from 1988.  Some civil servants have not been required to pay the full social insurance contribution, so we cannot introduce a standard of 40 years of contributions when people who were in full-time or part-time employment were not required by the law of the land at the time to make a social insurance contribution.  Forty years is just not practical.  There are other reasons, such as the Senator suggested not giving people enough of a lead-in time, but that for us is the ultimate reason.  It is just too difficult for people to reach that goal.  It is unrealistic.  We have seen the difficulties the 2012 pensioners had but that will be small fry if we introduce a 40-year target in January of next year.  We would say that the qualifying age will be the bigger problem for people as the age of eligibility is being pushed out.<\/p> <p>  When making our submission to the Government on auto-enrolment, it was a concern and is a concern of ICTU that auto-enrolment will cause displacement with current occupational pensions.  For some pension schemes, where the contribution is less that the 6% employer contribution, that would be fine and it will bring people up.  Our fear would be that the recommended contribution would become a ceiling and not a floor, that employers would reduce their contribution down to the proposed 6% of salary, if that is what it is going to be.  Auto-enrolment would displace existing pensions by employers moving over or reducing the level of contribution if it is above the minimum.  Another possible fear is that auto-enrolment will displace current good occupational pensions and that these occupational pension schemes will be closed to new members and new members will be auto-enrolled into the State pension and existing workers would remain in the occupational scheme.  In our submission to Government on auto-enrolment, we ask that this area will be examined within the first year and in time after that to see if there is a displacement and if there is, that we will look towards the good practice Senator Higgins mentioned. <\/p> <p>  Timelines were mentioned.  We think it is really good, regardless of what they will be, that timelines will be introduced because the current legislation as it exists is that an employer can wake up on a morning and decide it no longer wishes to contribute to a DB scheme, which mostly has the effect of triggering the winding down of that scheme.  As there currently exists no timeline, the fear is that if employers see this legislation or other legislation gathering speed, it will accelerate the closure of those schemes.<\/p><p>They can already do that and this is the current legislation gap.  Timelines are really important and sponsoring employers are required to come up with a plan in a timely manner to engage.  There is room for negotiation on what those timelines should be but the inclusion of timelines is something we support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554937200,"counter":1971,"content":"<p>Ultimately, in terms of looking at employers and the provision of defined benefit schemes, Deputy O'Dea is correct that there can be an incentive never to lose the opportunity of some crisis.  It does not matter how temporary the crisis is, as a crisis, generally speaking, would not necessarily be visited on the shareholders of a company but rather the employees in a pension scheme.  Any piece of legislation that provides a degree of protection to workers in such circumstances must be welcomed.  With a defined benefit scheme, a person has with a degree of some certainty - insofar as we can have certainty over 30 or 40 years - to be able to plan for retirement and know what benefits he or she is likely to get when that person gets to 65 or whatever the provisions are in the pension scheme.  In defined contribution schemes, as we know, the only certainty is what is put into the scheme.  Workers have no idea what investment people are going to make with the money at the end of the day.  Where defined benefit schemes operate, they need protection.  This is particularly the case where an opportunity arises to take advantage of a crisis, no matter how temporary is that crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Billy Hannigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1554937200,"counter":1972,"content":"<p>Dr. Bambrick mentioned the eminence of the total contributions system and I raised this the other day in the D&aacute;il during Question Time.  The Minister told me it is now envisaged this would not be introduced until at least the second half of next year.  There is clearly consideration of the 40-year model versus the 30-year model.  As the committee knows, the 40-year period applies to the temporary arrangement for the post-2012 people.  We have strongly argued and made submissions to the Minister about why it should be 30 years for the proper system, which will go into place next year.  I hope we will be successful in that regard.  There is also another issue that has been brought to my attention and which will require a decision from the Government.  In order to qualify at all for a contributory pension, a person will have to meet 520 contributions paid in total.  That used to be 260 and this was unilaterally increased to 520 in 2012 but I do not know the reason behind that.<\/p> <p>  I take the point on auto-enrolment versus defined benefit pension schemes.  The Government proposals on auto-enrolment indicate that where companies have a pension scheme in place, members will not be automatically enrolled and it will be a choice for members.  There are a number of issues around that.  I take the point about increases if benefits are lower or people losing out.  We have made detailed submissions to the Government on that.  It invited different political parties to make submissions and we have done so.<\/p> <p>  I take Mr. Hannigan's point, which has not been sufficiently emphasised in all this debate.  It is the fundamental difference between defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.  Anybody who has paid into a defined contribution scheme would have seen investment wiped out during the recession because investment managers do not have some sort of hidden wisdom and get things wrong.  The auto-enrolment scheme is going to be a defined contribution scheme, which is the problem.  I put it to the Minister and I did not get a response but if there is a 2% payment by the State, with 6% coming from both the employer and employee, is it possible that the State contribution could be used to provide an element of defined benefit?  This could bring some certainty and people would not be hammered just because the guys who get the money to invest it make a hames of it, get it wrong or are unlucky.  Is it possible part of that funding could be used to give more certainty about a minimum floor?  I know the floor is already the contributory old-age pension but I would like to think there could be a second floor.  The Chairman can confirm that we debated the Estimates for social welfare recently.  The &euro;5 per week we gave last year cost the Government approximately &euro;80 million.  The fact that so many extra people joined the ranks of the pensioners cost the Government three times that sum, and that trend will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019041100002#M00300","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554937200,"counter":1973,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the 520 contributions that must be made to qualify even for a reduced pension.  In the UK in recent years, they have removed the stipulation that they must be paid contributions.  They can be a mixture of paid or credited or all credited.  That is a good move.  If the stipulation for 520 contributions remains and there is no return to the 260 contributions, it may be beneficial to individuals and the type of people, mostly women caring in the home, to have a mixture or allowing credited contributions to be taken into account to make the higher number.

A concern of congress is that we are more or less requiring workers - there is an element of compulsion as there is a small window if people want to opt out - to put 6% of their pay into a second-tier pension.  How can we guarantee that they will have some return?  Our understanding is that with the limited number of schemes that will be introduced, there will be some sort of timing factor.  When people reach a certain age they will automatically go into a low-risk plan, which in itself will guarantee a minimum.  There will not be a minimum floor, however.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, congress would argue the best protection for workers in the auto-enrolment is not allowing this to be divvied up by commercial pension providers.
