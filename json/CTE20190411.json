We will be looking at capital projects and if it falls easily under that heading when we come to discuss capital projects, then we will do that.<\/p> <p>  We will also write back on this.  Perhaps we were not specific enough.  We asked for details on the comprehensive appraisal with regard to budgeted projects.  In our letter we also asked for details on how the costs estimations could be improved.  There was a long list of good intentions supplied in the document but they are all in the future.  We want to see timescales.  We will write back seeking specific timescales on the second question.<\/p> <p>  One issue we did not address in our letter to the Secretary General, which I would like be addressed at this stage, is the whole question of value for money, which was not mentioned anywhere in the document.  Perhaps we did not specifically ask this but while it is fine to talk about cost appraisals, we need to know the assessment process as to whether a project meets the value for money criteria, which is a basic requirement for major projects.  We want a detailed note of how that happened and how it is integrated into the approval process for any major projects.<\/p> <p>  We also had clarification on the use of the two-stage contracting process and any derogation from lump sum contracts or common standard contracts since 2011.  There is a list of 12 or 13 items that got a derogation from the lump sum contracts or were two-stage contracting processes.  This will be noted and published.  If anyone wants to follow that up then please do so.  We will come back to this topic as part of our overall look at capital projects.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2087B from Mr. Maurice Quinn provides information requested by the committee regarding expenditure on ships for the Naval Service.  This reply is on foot of correspondence from a member of the public who queried such expenditure in light of perceived issues regarding recruitment.  The Secretary General provides information regarding recruitment in 2018 and so far this year.  We will note and publish that response.  There is a lot of interesting information included about ships being retired that are more than 35 years of age, and other information on the Naval Service being obliged to commission a number of new ships in light of other ships being decommissioned, including on the time it takes to deal with this.  This letter will be noted and published.  It will be of interest to some people.<\/p> <p>  No. 2091B is from Commissioner Mark O'Mahoney at the Tax Appeals Commission, responding to our request for further information regarding appeals that are closed.  The committee had asked for details on those appeals.  The commission points out that the request should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners.  The committee will write to the Revenue Commissioners requesting the details on those cases that were before the Tax Appeals Commission that are either closed or have been withdrawn.  A large amount of money is involved in many of the cases we highlighted.  We are concerned about what was the final outcome for the taxpayer.  We will ask the Revenue Commissioners to give the committee a note on that.  It is up to Revenue to calculate that figure.  The Tax Appeals Commission makes the overall decision but it is up to Revenue to do the sums afterwards.  Am I right in this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I believe that the cases that were closed were settlements between Revenue and the appellant, not determinations of the Tax Appeals Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The cases were, effectively, withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Exactly.

Obviously they will not identify any particular case but if large cases that were before the Tax Appeals Commission have since been closed then it saves work for the Tax Appeals Commission if it does not have to deal with them.  That in its own right is good.  In light of that we will ask the commission to give us an estimate of the value of the cases currently remaining.  We were speaking of &euro;1.6 billion figure at one stage with a potential tax payment &euro;1.1 billion but if a lot of those cases have been disposed of, then some of them may already have been paid or in some cases due refunds.  We will ask the commission to give us an up-to-date figure.  We had asked for the ten most recent or current high-value cases before it but we will now ask for the total quantum of cases currently on its files.  It would be interesting to see if there has been movement on that.<\/p> <p>  No. 2092, received from Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, dated 27 March, relates to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The correspondence contains one very interesting item that people may be surprised to note.  The committee will bring in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and a date has been set for this to be on the work programme, which we will come to in a moment.  In light of the PricewaterhouseCoopers', PwC, report published this week on the cost escalation that will be a very important meeting, and we will also discuss that in due course.<\/p> <p>  The cover note to the document the committee has been given says the correspondence deals with the consideration of the delivery options for phase B of the new children's hospital.  It includes a detailed document that details the options going forward by the HSE.  This was probably dealt with in November of last year before the decision was made by the Government.  The document lists the three options for completing phase B: instruct BAM, the main contractor; instruct a new main contractor; or instruct a management contractor.  The document includes a detailed assessment of the objectives and risks on each of the options.  This document was prepared last autumn and a paragraph on its third page struck me immediately.  It states \"The HSE, at the request of the Department of Health, has sought input from a range of advisors including PwC and Alan Moore (Director of Strategic Capital Development in Northern Ireland), who have met with members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the project delivery team, to inform their views on these questions.\"  It is the first time I have spotted it but perhaps others have seen it before now.  It appears to me that we have a situation where the Department of Health is telling us that PwC was one of its advisers last November or December in the decision on which option to choose.  PwC was also appointed to do the cost escalation report, published in recent days at a cost of approximately &euro;500,000 to the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  The issue of conflict of interest in respect of PwC was raised extensively at the commencement of that process.  They assured us that there was no conflict of interest with regard to BAM, the HSE or the board.  At the time we asked how PwC could be invited to carry out that work without it going through a procurement process at that stage.  They gave us a valid answer that it was already on the list of consultants that could be called on at any time based on a pre-tendering framework.  That is fine but now we see that \"The HSE, at the request of the Department of Health, has sought input from a range of advisors including PwC\".  These are the words of the HSE in relation to this decision.  I want a detailed explanation, immediately and within 24 hours, from the Secretary General.  This story will have to be resolved within 24 hours.  People, including journalists, will be asking how is it that PwC was involved in the decision process looking at how the project would go forward into phase B, and yet was also commissioned to carry out the costs escalation report that was published yesterday.  I do not know how this has arisen.  I am going on the HSE document.<\/p> <p>  This is a separate issue from the Mazars report that was prepared for the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on preliminary observations in relation to the construction capital cost escalation of the national children's hospital, issued on 17 December 2018.  PwC was involved in the process in or around November 2018.  A Mazars report on cost escalation was issued in December.  The HSE then commissioned PwC to do another cost escalation report early this year, at another cost to the taxpayer.  This was all in the process of how the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board arrived at its internal report, dated 28 November 2018, entitled Process to Guaranteed Maximum Price: Working Together for our Children.  We need clarification of the statement by the HSE that PwC were involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I am glad the Chairman raised it.  I did not read the report.  I just glanced at it today and saw that.  I had it marked.  I brought in the report with me.  It is not up for discussion today but I am glad the Chairman raised it because it ties in with the conclusions made.  It seems to me that PwC was never asked to make conclusions.  It was given terms of reference to look at governance and other matters, on which it made recommendations.<\/p><p>On page 8 the word \"conclusion\" jumps off the page.  I wonder about it as I do not see it relating to the terms of reference.  What is particularly interesting is that at the bottom they say, \"At this point, taking any alternative course of action other than continuing would in all likelihood result in significant delay\".  They conclude that one should not go a different route, but that had been decided in the document to which the Chairman referred with input from them at that point.  That is a serious issue.   I agree with the Chairman.  I do not know if that conclusion should be there in the first place but it is a very different forum or may be the next time we discuss it.  Certainly, they are reinforcing what they had apparently said when they gave advice, subject to reading the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#C00700","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We will ask for clarification of that.

I do not like to be in conflict with the Chairman, who is very fair and very good to us all.  His is a difficult job at times.  I got an opportunity last week to mention that I needed to raise this matter with the Chairman before the meeting.  I put a series of questions on the record that were relevant to the Irish Prison Service.  Off the record, I informed everybody present that I was about to do this.  If people could understand, they would give me a bit of latitude.  I knew we were dealing with the Vote that is primarily of concern to the Department of Justice and Equality but, as often happens, one uses the opportunity if one can to raise some other issues.  It was the first opportunity we had with the Irish Prison Service being before the committee and the response that was given to it in writing on 7 February so I did what I did.  I took legal advice on the framing of questions and explained to the witnesses in advance that while I appreciated that I might not have the relevant expertise or that the relevant line managers were not with us, it would be perfectly fine for those answers to be given in writing after the fact.  We proceeded along those lines.<\/p> <p>  I must put on record a couple of things said by the Chairman.  I do not like to be in conflict with him but as this happened in public session, I would like it to be clarified.  The Chairman stated that they were questions and issues raised by me as one of 13 members of this committee and that it was not a request from the Committee of Public Accounts until such time as the committee agreed to put the questions.  The Chairman later stated that it was not a request from the Committee of Public Accounts, that the committee had not yet decided what questions to put to the witness and that it was a request from one member and was not representative of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Later still, the Chairman stated that the member was not speaking for the committee but was speaking for himself and that it would be up to the committee to decide whether it wanted to put those questions to the witness.<\/p> <p>  That obviously causes a problem.  I am a member of the committee, as nominated by my party and formally selected by the Committee of Selection of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  To the best of my knowledge, and I have taken legal advice, I broke no Standing Order last week and raised no issue regarding parliamentary privilege.  To the best of my knowledge, the committee is the forum and the members ask the questions.  If the committee collectively decides to make a recommendation, that is certainly a committee decision but I know of no Standing Order that requires the unanimous agreement of the other 12 members as to the providence, validity or content of the question of one member, so that is a problem.<\/p><p>Will the Chairman respond to that?  As far as I am concerned, the Prison Service is included in the justice Vote.  While I appreciate that the subject of the meeting was the core justice Vote, digression to other matters relevant to that Department or Vote is reasonable and probably happens at every meeting.  In addition, it may be argued that at least some, if not all, the matters I raised last week could fall under the remit of the internal audit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  In any event, it did not depart from the practice of the past.  Would the Chairman like to retract the unilateral instruction to the witness to the effect that he did not have to answer any questions, and the implication that my questions had to be affirmed, approved or checked by the committee as a whole?  I will reserve my right to petition the Committee on Procedure about the matter.  While I do not wish to be in conflict with the Chairman, the statements are of a serious nature.<\/p><p> I accept that my style of questioning may irk many people, such as fellow Members, the media and witnesses at times, but that is a separate matter which can, as long as I follow the rules, be adjudicated by the people of Sligo-Leitrim in due course.  Nevertheless, the content, questions and quotes I have read directly from the transcript of last week's meeting seemed to undermine severely my position as a member of the committee.  Suggesting that I was effectively a lone soldier who had gone rogue and asked irrelevant, inappropriate questions that required the approval of the other 12 members of the committee went beyond what I believe would be reasonably permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#E02000","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I wish to provide clarification on the serious issues for the benefit of the Deputy.  During the meeting, I listened carefully to his contribution and there was nothing wrong whatsoever with his style.  It was a cogently presented set of remarks and questions.  We can agree everything that was asked related to the remit of the Prison Service.<\/p> <p>  As Chairman, I came to the view that some of the remarks that were made related to behaviour that may have involved criminality.  I felt that it was my duty as the Chairman of a committee, and as an individual, that if remarks relating to potential criminality were highlighted to me, they should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I stated last week that the entire transcript, including the issues raised by the Deputy, needed to be investigated in respect of criminality, such as theft of State property and other items, within the Prison Service.  I stated I would send the transcript to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which I did via the superintendent in Pearse Street, which is the division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which Leinster House is based.  I have carried out, therefore, what I indicated at the meeting that I would.<\/p> <p>  All committees are conducted through the Chairperson.  All questions are put through the Chairperson, who, in turn, puts them to the witnesses.  That is a well-established principle.  To allow for free-flowing meetings, I regularly let people ask and answer questions directly but it is always understood that the questions are put through the Chairperson.  Under Standing Orders, it is the duty of the Chairperson to chair the meeting and all questions are asked through him or her.  When issues were raised by a member with me as Chairman, I made an early judgment that some of the issues involved criminal activity.  I had a simple choice.  I could have put the questions to the Accounting Officer, who would follow them up and revert in due course to the committee, or, if I considered the matters to be very serious, I could decide to put the questions directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its investigation.  I chose the latter option.  Due to the nature of what was said, I felt that it would be more appropriate if some of the remarks were forwarded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its consideration and for any action it may or may not choose to take, rather than ignoring the potential criminality that was highlighted during the meeting and, as if nothing had happened, putting it to the witness as a routine question to be considered.  As will have been seen at every meeting of the committee, members raise issues and ask questions and I invariably ask witnesses to respond directly to the committee in respect of the matter in order that the answer will be conveyed to the rest of the committee.  I make the request on behalf of the committee.  When I say it is a decision of the committee, I am making that decision, as Chairman, on behalf of the committee.  It is not the case that the other members must vet anyone's questions.<\/p> <p>  To clarify the matter, I will read aloud a sentence that I read every morning at every meeting and that I will have to read three times later in the meeting because there are three witnesses.  I state: \"If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.\"  That is the established process in the Oireachtas.  If a witness is directed by a committee to cease giving evidence, he or she must do so.  In practical terms, if the witness is requested to cease giving evidence, the request will be made by the Chairperson on behalf of the committee.  Even though we state the committee can instruct a witness to cease giving evidence, the Chairperson, in fact, issues the instruction on behalf of the committee.  When I stated at the previous meeting that it would be a matter for the committee to decide, I did not intend in any way to imply that members could veto other members' questions.  As I make clear at every meeting, I, as Chairman, will make a ruling on behalf of the committee as to whether questions or answers are appropriate.  I can give a warning accordingly, which is what I did at the previous meeting.  In my role as Chairman, I indicated I was not willing to allow that question to be put through me to an Accounting Officer when, due to the seriousness of the matter, I would convey those questions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for consideration, which is what happened.  Until I, on behalf of the committee, decide that the questions should be put to the Accounting Officer, they will not be.  When I referred to the committee, it reflected the language used in the House.  I refer back to the remarks that I will make three times later in the meeting.  The instruction about the committee potentially asking someone to cease giving evidence means, in practice, that the Chairperson can issue such an instruction.  That is how I interpreted it.  I did not mean the individual members of the committee but rather that if I, as Chairman, wished to conduct a meeting in such a way and decided, on behalf of the committee, that those questions should not be put to the Accounting Officer, I would convey them to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the basis for my decision and I am fully satisfied with the correctness of my approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#F00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I am not satisfied, for a couple of reasons.  There is no issue with sending the transcript to the Garda and, in fact, I support it.  That has nothing to do with it.  The issue of a witness being told to stop giving evidence for fear of having qualified privilege only is also a separate issue.

It may well be there are no issues of criminality.  It was perfectly reasonable to put to the Accounting Officer if he or the Prison Service are aware of A, B, C, D, E, F and G and if not, can they carry out the necessary inquiries.  That was what was on each of my questions, as this will show.<\/p><p> The other implication of what the Chairman is saying is that if it is case that it may end up with criminality being highlighted as a result of some of these questions, that means that in effect he is narrowing the scope of this committee.  What happens if we want to ask questions under the Competition Act, the Criminal Justice Act, the Companies Act, the Health and Safety Act or the Tax Acts, all of which could have implications in criminality?<\/p><p> What happened last week was perfectly within the Chairman&rsquo;s remit.  As I said, I hate to be in any sort of conflict with the Chair.  However, my entitlement as a committee member to put questions to an Accounting Officer was effectively removed.

He said the rules were not broken but then you decided that, although I am full member of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Secretary General and Accounting Officer relevant to this area would not answer these questions.

However, to suggest the Department of Justice and Equality does not have a role is incredible.<\/p><p> If this were to stand as a precedent, we would not be allowed to ask questions in here.  There is the potential for criminality in many of the issues discussed here and in many of the questions put.  Again, I made no accusations against individuals, anybody identifiable or anything like that.  Process, procedures, institutions and the need prudence demands for investigations to be carried out are fine.

That is in order.  The committee will want to review the discussion here today.  If I am wrong on this, the committee can tell me.  However my view, like in my opening comment, is that when witnesses are here, all questions and answers are through the Chair.  There is no vetting by any member of another member's questions.  The Chair has authority to make a ruling that, to put a question to an Accounting Officer, it comes through the Chair or say to an Accounting Officer that he or she will not answer that question.  I have had to say it to Accounting Officers on previous occasions that a question will not be answered on the day.  I have instructed Accounting Officers on previous occasions not to answer a question that a member may have raised but that I felt, as Chairman, was not appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I made the decision on the day as Chairperson, chairing the meeting on behalf of the committee.  It was not the committee that was not putting your questions.  It was me, as Chairman of the committee, acting on behalf of the committee.  I used the reference I read out earlier in relation to witnesses as a parallel.  It was not a direct comparison.  It is an example to show that when we refer to the committee, making a statement about some evidence, which, in practice, it is done by the Chair on behalf of the committee.  It is not all members of the committee have to agree.  In practice, it means the Chair has to do it.  If the Oireachtas&rsquo;s instruction to every committee is that the Chair has no authority to do that unless the full committee makes a decision, that is fine.  If that changes the rules for every Chair of every committee, that is fine.  I will follow that rule.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, the questions, as always, are put through the Chair.  I took my decision as Chair not to allow those questions be put through me to the Accounting Officer.  I made the decision and wanted those questions to be sent to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is what I did.  That is my position.  We have both indicated our positions on it.  I have no problem with some higher committee in this establishment ruling on these matters.  It will not be a matter specific to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It will be a matter relating to the role of all chairmen of all Oireachtas committees.  If clarification is required, I welcome that.  Whatever the outcome of that process is, every other committee Chair and I will take note of that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#G00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>To conclude, I must express regret.

I am joined by several colleagues.  Maria Hurley is assistant director general with responsibility for the corporate affairs directorate, which includes the finance, governance and human resources functions.  Jennifer Banim is assistant director general of the economic statistics directorate.  Richard McMahon is assistant director general of the social and demography directorate.  I propose to briefly outline the role of the Central Statistics Office as well as our strategy and achievements during 2017.  I will also give an overview of the CSO 2017 appropriation account and outline CSO expenditure in 2017.<\/p> <p>  The CSO is Ireland's national statistical institute and is responsible for the production and oversight of the production of all official statistics for Ireland.  The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The role of the director general of the CSO is prescribed in the Statistics Act 1993, which provides that the officeholder acts independently and exercises sole responsibility in professional statistical matters, including statistical methodology, professional standards, timing and content of statistical releases and methods of dissemination.<\/p> <p>  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.  The functions of the CSO, as set out in the Statistics Act, include \"the collection, compilation, extraction and dissemination for statistical purposes of information relating to economic, social and general activities and conditions in the State.\"  This mandate was broadened under EU Regulation No. 223\/2009, which makes the CSO director general responsible for the co-ordination and oversight of the quality of all European official statistics compiled by public authorities in Ireland.  Confidence in the quality and independence of official statistics is crucial as this information serves as an objective input to policy development, oversight and governance at national and international levels.<\/p> <p>  Under EU regulation, each member state was invited to commit to improve or maintain the conditions for the implementation of the European statistics code of practice via a commitment on confidence.  In May 2017, the Government adopted a commitment on confidence in statistics.  In signing this declaration, the Government reaffirmed the CSO's independence, impartiality and commitment to quality.<\/p> <p>  From a governance and planning perspective, good policies start with good data.  Good data are the lifeblood of decision-making and the basis for accountability.  The role of the CSO is to make sense of data by providing high quality statistics, independent insight and information for effective debate and decision-making across government, business and society.  The work we do creates good quality statistics that help people to understand the changes taking place in Ireland's economy and society.<\/p> <p>  The key deliverables and objectives for the CSO are informed by national and European policy.  The CSO delivers a demanding and growing statistical work programme each year.  In 2017, a total of 345 electronic releases and publications were published, including 13 outputs on census 2016.  We are currently preparing for the next census in 2021.  In addition to electronic releases and publications, the CSO transmits data to EUROSTAT, the Central Bank, the European Central Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Health Organization, among others.<\/p> <p>  The European statistical system has a significant impact on the work of the CSO.  Approximately 73% of the statistics we produced in 2017 were required under EU statistical legislation.  The CSO is an active member of the European statistical system and is centrally involved in key committees and executive bodies across a range of domains.<\/p> <p>  We delivered across all our strategic aims in 2017.  Alongside our 2017 statistical work programme, we completed the census 2016 project during 2017, producing some new style results publications and more than 30 individual infographics to support the communication of key releases.  We published the first estimate of GNI*.  This is a modified indicator of the overall size or level of the economy.  We also published a modified total domestic demand indicator that focuses on activity within the Irish economy.  This is designed to exclude significant globalisation effects that disproportionately affect the Irish economic results.<\/p> <p>  We established the Irish statistical system co-ordination directorate, which is leading on key strategic issues such as the development of the national data infrastructure and the co-ordination of professional statistical services to the broader Irish public system.  We continued to explore the use of secondary and blended data sources to compile new analysis, progressing the evolution of official statistics through the use of emerging data resources while focusing on burden reduction for respondents.<\/p><p>We introduced a more cost-effective data collection methodology in our household survey domain, namely, computer assisted telephone interviewing, which has afforded respondents a greater degree of flexibility in the manner in which they engage with the office and support our field force in concentrating its efforts on respondent recruitment in an environment of persistently falling response rates. <\/p><p> The CSO ran the Civil Service employee engagement survey in 2017, which operated across the entire Civil Service under action 25 of the Civil Service renewal plan and provided important insights into the experiences and opinions of those working in the Civil Service.  The results were compiled by the office before being supplied to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for analysis and publication and the resulting outputs were used to inform further development towards the reform of the Civil Service.  We capitalised on new approaches to communication and user engagement by developing a new style of infographic and developing user applications on Brexit, house prices and the consumer price index among others.  <\/p><p> The CSO also improved access to data for researchers by launching a remote access to microdata solution for researchers in 2017, significantly improving data security.  From an internal statistical quality perspective, during 2017 the CSO continued its investment in the new quality and methodology support function, headed by a senior statistician and tasked with underpinning the CSO's efforts to consistently refine its approach to quality management in official statistics and its commitment to continuous methodological improvement.  Overall, 2017 was a year of transition for the CSO, maintaining the historic focus on the systematic production of key economic and social indicators, while striving to broaden the focus and reach of official statistics to a more mainstream audience in response to the public demand for access to impartial and high-quality data to inform evaluation and decision making. <\/p><p> The net outturn for the CSO in 2017 was &euro;44.727 million against an estimate provision of &euro;48.584 million.  This lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in a surrender of &euro;3.856 million back to the Exchequer at the end of December 2017.  The bulk of the saving related to expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances that are payable to permanent staff assigned to the office.  The 2017 appropriation account was audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p> I will briefly outline the office&rsquo;s expenditure in 2017.  First, with respect to salaries, the bulk of the office's expenditure is expended on salaries, wages and allowances that are paid to permanent staff assigned to the CSO.  In 2017, this expenditure amounted to &euro;36.080 million against an estimate of &euro;38.983 million.  Savings of &euro;2.903 million were realised.  The estimate allocation was based on staff numbers of 755 but the actual number serving throughout the year was lower at 736.  This was mainly due to difficulties and delays in the filling of vacancies at statistician level and in IT technical grades during the year. <\/p><p> With respect to other non-pay, in line with other Votes, the CSO has several non-pay administrative subheads: A(ii) travel and subsistence; A(iii) training and development and incidental expenses; A(iv) postal and telecommunications services; A(v) office equipment and external IT services; A(vi) office premises expenses; A(vii) consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews; and A(viii) collection of statistics.  Non-pay administrative expenditure of the office in 2017 amounted to &euro;10.189 million against an estimate of &euro;10.989 million.  Savings of &euro;800,000 were returned to the Exchequer.   The detail of this expenditure is set out in appendix A, which has been circulated to the committee. <\/p><p> Our strategic goals were captured in our statement of strategy 2016 to 2019, which was published in late 2016.  In this, we said that we aim to turn data and statistics into information and knowledge for all; to increase the use of secondary data sources; to continue to build the capacity of our people; to modernise our statistical processes and systems, and to co-ordinate, oversee and assure the quality of all official statistics produced in Ireland.  The CSO is operating in an increasingly challenging environment.  We are experiencing growing user demand, both nationally and from Europe, where EUROSTAT and the European Central Bank are the two main sources.  The CSO is increasingly being asked to take on new survey work or to incorporate existing studies into its programme of official statistics, as can be seen by the recent announcement to embed the Growing Up in Ireland survey from 2023 and the decision to task the CSO with conducting a new sexual violence survey, a modern successor to the 2002 SAVI report.  <\/p><p> The complexity of the world we are trying to measure is also increasing with emerging issues such as globalisation and digitalisation, which result in complex economic transactions necessitating sophisticated analysis to decipher.  We are experiencing transformational change in the range and complexity of the data sources available to describe our economy and our society.  We are witnessing the use of statistics and data by a growing variety of stakeholders, sometimes with agenda-driven emphasis.  We are experiencing growing levels of scrutiny of data to ascertain its reliability, accuracy and veracity.  In this environment, the CSO is responding by maintaining a focus on its important heritage of impartiality and objectivity in the formulation of transparently produced, accurate and reliable official statistics, while exploring the boundaries of technology, data sources and statistical methods and techniques to persistently enhance the quality and insight afforded by our outputs.  To do this, we are committed to building an innovative, agile and high-performing organisation to fully exploit the potential of the data and technological revolutions.  Our aim is to deliver a broader range of high-quality information on societal and economic change for Ireland, which is demonstrably independent and without bias, and which can withstand scrutiny as regards data sources, statistical methodology and the impartiality of its compilers.  In so doing, we can support the process of guiding Ireland&rsquo;s future development for the benefit of all our citizens.  That concludes my statement.  I thank the members for their attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions they have to offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dalton for that.

There were issues with classification of certain crimes.  Some crimes were not classified in the right category.  There were some cases where crimes were not captured on PULSE at all.  There were some duplication issues.  There was no clarity on the application of the crime recording rules.  The crime recording rules effectively constitute a manual that provides absolute clarity.  They are supposed to provide clarity on how any particular crime is supposed to be accounted for in a recorded crime system like PULSE.  Obviously, they have these crime recording rules in other jurisdictions.  We are working continuously with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to try to improve the quality of its data for its purposes first of all because it needs good quality data from PULSE for its own reasons.  Then we would become downstream beneficiaries.  One of the things we are working on in particular involves the crime recording rules.  We are trying to encourage them and we will work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop this crime recording rules document.<\/p> <p>  There are two other things we want An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do.  We want it to introduce a formal quality management framework.  The quality division in the CSO has met An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explain what the quality management framework would be like and to outline how it might go about improving the quality of the data on PULSE over time.  Finally, we really feel it is important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appoints a single person at a very senior level to take point on data-related issues.  At the minute, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an interim chief data officer.  I think the intention is make that a permanent post.  This is incredibly important for us but it is important that this role be at a very senior level in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the person can influence the development and the move towards improving crime data.  <\/p> <p>  Under reservation is a term used by EUROSTAT for government finance statistics.  If EUROSTAT has a concern about a country's government finance statistics, it can put this reservation on the data.  What it effectively means is that there are concerns about the data and EUROSTAT cannot fully stand over the data.  We were left in this situation where there was a vacuum.  Our concern is that vacuums normally get filled with anecdotal information or poor quality or subjective data.  The longer a vacuum is left, the greater the risk that this occurs so we took the decision to resume publication but we needed to be clear with users that there was an issue with the data.  That is why we put in the classification \"Under Reservation\".<\/p> <p>  What we have also done to help users is produce three quality reports on the data coming from PULSE.  We try to give a clear signal to users that the figures on a certain classification coming from PULSE may well be an understatement, for example, burglaries.  We give a clear statement in the quality report as to our assessment of the accuracy of the particular statistic on whichever part or type of crime it is.  We could have left a vacuum and said we were not going to publish but we felt transparency was important.

In broad terms, it is important to understand that more than half of our medium-term vacancies relate to specialist technology posts.  One of the greatest difficulties we have had in this regard concerns the lack of availability of panels of staff ready to be appointed and the necessity, in some cases, to run tailored competitions.<\/p> <p>  On the statistical side, we run statistical competitions every year.  It happened last year that our full panel of statisticians was exhausted by the autumn.  Therefore, it is only vacancies that have crystallised on the statistical side since the autumn that continue into to this year.  Added to that, it is important to note that, because we supply statisticians for secondment to the wider statistical system, we have a constant catalogue of requests coming in for statisticians to send on secondment.  That has also created backlogs.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the other dimension, concerning risk management and the extent to which we engage with staff, whether it be through the Civil Service employee engagement survey, CSEES, or other channels, we have already published our action plan further to the CSEES survey.  The action plan was developed in consultation with colleagues from across the organisation.  There are now active working groups considering what actions are required to give effect to the objectives set out in the action plan.  A key channel in the delivery of those actions is our engagement and innovation board, which is a long-standing structure in the CSO.  It is a cross-staffing grade structure specifically targeted at affording a discussion forum for matters affecting staff in all areas of the business, both statistical and administrative.<\/p> <p>  The engagement and innovation board is just one of the forums we use to engage with staff.  We have grade-based forums, a senior management group forum, a general management form, and grade-based forms for all the administrative grades.  At present, we are in the process of completing a significant round of consultations in the preparation of the CSO people strategy to take us forward for the next several years in respect of the supports we are putting in place to develop our staff in terms of their technical skills and aptitude to deliver the supports required for the business and also to enable them to fulfil their full potential.  I will follow up in writing with further detail, as the Deputy requested.  I hope, however, my answer gives some illustration of the extensive variety of consultations and forums that are available to enable the flow of information in both directions across the entire organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#R02400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Hurley"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses.

Legally, the office is part of the Civil Service and is funded through Vote 8.  As the Constitution requires that I must audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, specific arrangements have to be put in place to facilitate this being done in an independent fashion.<\/p> <p>  First, it should be noted that Ms Drinan, as secretary, is the administrative head of the office, with responsibility for operations and ensuring good value delivery of the service.  This is in addition to her responsibility as a director of audit for delivery of a portfolio of audits and reports.  As Accounting Officer, she controls the annual Estimate and the office&rsquo;s spending, and is responsible for submitting the appropriation account.<\/p> <p>  Second, I appoint a competitively procured, private sector auditor to carry out the audit of the appropriation account on my behalf, and to report to me on the results of the audit.  The contract for the audit is currently with Mazars.  The objective of the audit is the same as for all other appropriation account audits and the audit approach is similar to that carried out by my office for all other Votes.  I rely on the certificate and report of Mazars as the basis for presentation of my own certificate, and the auditor&rsquo;s certificate is presented with my own to the Oireachtas.  Consequently, I am accompanied for this session by Mr. Bernard Barron, a partner at Mazars, who leads the audit for the company. <\/p> <p>  Due to the requirement under auditing standards to rotate responsibility for particular audits, I appointed Ms Drinan to her current portfolio in January of this year.  She replaced Mr. Harkness on that portfolio, and also as secretary of the office and as Accounting Officer.  Mr. Harkness had fulfilled that role for just over six years and members will note that he signed off on the 2017 appropriation account.  He, too, is in attendance.<\/p> <p>  The office&rsquo;s appropriation account records gross expenditure of &euro;11.9 million in 2017, representing an increase of around 3% on the 2016 expenditure.  The bulk of the expenditure each year is on salaries.  Non-Exchequer receipts into the Vote amounted to just under &euro;6 million in 2017.  This mainly comprised receipts of fees charged by the office for non-Vote financial audits carried out by the office.  The office&rsquo;s policy, as agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is full recovery of the costs incurred on non-Vote audits over a three-year cycle.  Fees are not charged for Vote audits or audits of the finance and Revenue accounts, or in respect of any reporting work undertaken.  As a result of the recovery of fees and some other appropriations-in-aid, the net expenditure on the Vote in 2017 was just under &euro;6 million.  The surplus for surrender at the year end was &euro;978,000.  I am glad to report that the office received a clear audit opinion and there were no matters arising from the audit that I or Mazars considered required reporting to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and call Ms Drinan to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#S00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee for the invitation to appear before it.

In his opening statement, the Comptroller and Auditor General set out the distinction between his constitutional role and the role of the office, and my role as Accounting Officer.  When I became Accounting Officer in January, I took on responsibility for the administrative operations of the office.  As such, I am responsible for ensuring that adequate financial management and internal control systems are in place to support the proper administration of the office in an economical and efficient manner. <\/p> <p>  The office&rsquo;s approved staff complement is 178.  As at 31 March 2019, the office had 159 full-time equivalent members of staff and 19 vacancies.  We have recently completed a trainee auditor recruitment process, resulting in a panel of 29, and consequently the number of vacancies is expected to be reduced significantly in the coming weeks.  The current staff are distributed across three functional areas.  Nearly three quarters of the staff work on financial audit, 15% work on examination reporting, while 12% work on support services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Drinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>What does Ms Drinan mean by examination reporting?

It is performance audit.<\/p><p>Financial audit involves the annual financial audits of almost 290 clients.  All financial audit staff from the auditor grade upwards are qualified accountants.  Audits are carried out in accordance with international standards on auditing.  To manage peaks in demand during the calendar year the office contracts out a number of these financial audits annually.  A key objective of the office is to advance the timeliness of the completion of financial audits.  The committee will be aware of the progress made on this over recent years.  At the end of 2018, eight sets of financial statements relating to 2017 or earlier years had not been certified.  This compares with 13 arrears for 2017.<\/p><p> The output of the reporting programme comprises the report on the accounts of the public services, which issues at the end of September each year, and special reports.  In 2018, a total of 29 reports were issued.  This was made up of 22 chapters in the report on the accounts of the public services and seven special reports.  The figure compares with 26 reports issued in 2017, made up of 24 chapters and two special reports.<\/p><p> Support services comprise a number of business units covering human resources, finance, information technology, good practice, business improvement, training and development and corporate services.<\/p><p> I will now set out the financial position.  In 2017, the office operated an administrative gross budget of &euro;12.64 million, nearly 82% of which was allocated to salaries.  During 2017, actual expenditure was approximately &euro;11.9 million, which was &euro;720,000 or 6% below budget.  This was primarily due to savings of approximately &euro;500,000 in salaries.  There was a further saving of &euro;291,000 in subhead A7 because our requirement for external assistance for examinations was less than budgeted for.<\/p><p> On the receipts side, audit fee income was up by over &euro;300,000, reflecting the earlier completion of the audit programme.  This trend continued in 2018.  The savings in salaries have arisen mainly due to turnover of staff and the carrying of unfilled vacancies.  Vacancies arise due to staff departing and due to an increase in the overall staff complement in recent years.  There is currently a shortage of qualified accountants in the Irish market as a result of the recovery in the economy.  This has created a demand for experienced accountants and we see the impact of this on our turnover rates.  We recruit actively.  In the past three years we have made 125 staff appointments, including 64 recruits at entry level.  The environment continues to be challenging and we keep this issue under constant review.<\/p><p> This is a brief overview of the office and its work.

It is also of the utmost importance that these critically ill babies are cared for close to their mothers during the most vulnerable period of their lives and that mothers are not kept apart from their sick babies, stressed and worried on the post-natal wards of maternity hospitals in different parts of the city.  I hope, by coming here today, that the committee will strongly recommend that the best interests of these critically ill babies, who have mortality rates between 5% and almost 20%, are addressed as a matter of priority for financial reasons, as this is the Committee of Public Accounts, but also, more importantly, for medical and compassionate reasons.  If we are building the most expensive hospital in the world, these babies need to be looked after.<br\/><br\/>By way of background, in November 2012, the then Minister for Health and current Senator, Dr. James Reilly, announced that the national paediatric hospital was to be developed on the current site at St. James's Hospital.  There was no reference to when a maternity hospital might be built although there was an aspiration to do so.  In October 2014, the then Minister for Health and current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, suggested that a planning application be submitted for a maternity hospital alongside the children's hospital.  This was not done.<br\/><br\/>A document supplied by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to the Committee of Public Accounts in January states, in reference to St. James's, that it is not known when or if it is certain that a maternity building will be constructed.  It is also of note that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's PowerPoint presentation to the Committee of Public Accounts on 31 January last contained not a single reference to maternity co-location.  It is fair to state that there is widespread scepticism that maternity co-location will happen unless it starts soon.<br\/><br\/>Why come before the Committee on Pubic Accounts?  The State is building the most expensive hospital in the world, namely, the national children's hospital.  It is intended that a maternity hospital will be built beside it in the interests of critically ill babies.  If a maternity hospital can never be built on this site or if, when the national children's hospital is built, there is simply no room left for such a facility, then the State will have built the most expensive hospital in the world on the wrong site.  This would be both a financial and medical catastrophe.<br\/><br\/>Although PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, did not mention it, it should also be noted that the original cost estimates for the development of the national children's hospital, including a basement car park as cited by St. James's Hospital in April 2012 to the all important Dolphin review, was &euro;297.75 million.  In the same submission, it was also stated that, &quot;The site proposed has very limited decanting requirements and thereby prompt access to site for development commencement (&amp;lt; 6 months).&quot;<font color=\"#4F4F4F\">  <\/font>Importantly, this proposal also contained a co-located maternity hospital of 42,000 sq. m.<br\/><br\/>There are certainly issues of concern as to how back-of-the-envelope financial calculations, assertions about easy site clearance and the availability of a very generous footprint for a maternity hospital, which seems to have evaporated, became the shaky foundations for the construction of the most expensive hospital in the world, the national children's hospital.  Added to this remains the intrigue surrounding reports in the media of a last-minute switch of sites by the Government.  Lessons also need to be learned from this.  With projected costs in excess of &euro;1.73 billion, a completion date now reset at 2023 and no sign of a co-located maternity hospital, the committee will agree that there is a need to think more carefully about what we are doing on this site, not just continuing blindly as though there are not very serious issues to deal with and not just believing everything that we are being told.<br\/><br\/>As I see it, there are two options for the current crisis relating to funding and maternity co-location.  One is to stop the current development and relocate to Connolly Hospital.  The advantages of Connolly Hospital are well known when it comes to construction methodology, space, nationwide access and the opportunity to co-locate the Rotunda Hospital.  The analysis of this option, however, must take into consideration the money spent, or lost, on the St. James's site to date, expenditure on the satellite centre at Connolly, estimated contractual liabilities and legal costs resulting from stopping the development of St. James's Hospital and the need to significantly upgrade the adult services in Connolly to the levels of St. James's Hospital, the Mater Hospital or St. Vincent's University Hospital to support the co-location of a maternity hospital and paediatric hospital.  That would be an enormous strategic and financial undertaking, which is often not factored into the equation, and also the long delay that would happen in that case.<br\/><br\/>At a pragmatic level, the project at St. James's Hospital, the site of which I visited last night, is probably past its tipping point.  In addition, there appears to be limited public support to stop and start again for the third time.  The political consequences of changing the site are considerable.  There are certainly no votes in stopping this building.<br\/><br\/>The other option is to continue with the development on the current site.  This should only continue if there is evidence that the overall projected costs can be properly estimated and are affordable; in other words, that there are no unknown unknowns, that the proper governance and cost control structures are put in place and that the recommendations of the PwC report are implemented.  The overall cost must also include a maternity hospital, which should have been included from the start and the current site must be stress tested, in the same way that PwC stress tested the finances, to ensure that it can accommodate a maternity hospital, the Coombe, and that the co-location of the latter is, in accordance with Government policy, now prioritised among other planned projects on a very busy St. James's Hospital site and included in the national capital plan, with a short timeline for delivery and ring-fenced funding.  It is of note now that St. James's Hospital is planning to build a cancer hospital.<\/p><p>This is a site that does not stand still, it is the busiest hospital in the State.  It needs to be prioritised that a maternity hospital is developed on this site if it is to happen at all.<\/p><p> Taking all this into consideration, I propose that this co-location of the maternity service on the St. James's campus be accelerated while, at the same, time fulfilling the ambitions of the national women and infants healthcare programme run by the HSE and Department of Health in respect of women's healthcare needs.  This proposal involves the transfer of maternity services only from the Coombe to St. James's Hospital.  The Coombe Hospital caters for both gynaecology services and maternity services.  It has the largest gynaecology service in the State.  It exists on 5.5 acres or 17,500 m2.  The site currently earmarked for the maternity hospital at St. James's is 3 acres, so there is an issue about fitting onto the site.  The way I propose that this be done is to move the maternity service but to retain the large gynaecology service on its current site in the context of an integrated campus.  This would allow the development of a benign gynaecology services as well as the national cervical screening laboratory services on the present Coombe site.  Any investment in that site would be future-proofed.  The reconfiguration of the services would also liberate space on the site which could be used to fund the co-location.<\/p><p> This would result in a faster tri-location, for less and on a smaller footprint and with considerably less campus disruption.  I will not give ballpark figures or back-of-the-envelope calculations but this would cost a minimal amount in comparison with the amount that has been squandered on the St. James's Hospital site.  This would develop an integrated campus across two sites.<\/p><p> Over the past week, \"Liveline\" has heard how the maternity services over the years have failed mothers and babies, how clinicians have failed at times to listen and to act with compassion and how things need to improve.  I am not sure what it takes for politicians to also listen and make decisions based on medical evidence and compassion as well as economics.  We do not want to be told in years to come how when we had the chance to do what was right, that we failed to respond to the critical needs of the most vulnerable children in the State and their mothers.  This is not a legacy that any Government or supply party in opposition in a confidence and supply agreement would want to leave behind.  <\/p><p> Critically ill babies should not be made to suffer because of poor decision-making at the start of this project and reckless spending since it commenced.  In the end, we bailed out the banks.  Babies and children are far more important than banks.  We need to bail out this hospital.  We need to build a maternity hospital as quickly as possible.  If that means going to the European Investment Bank, EIB, for another extension on a loan, so be it.  We also need to learn from our mistakes, including the mistakes that were made by the Dolphin review and that were made at the origin of this decision.  We must take account of our actions.  This is now a beleaguered project and we need to rediscover the vision that inspired us to bring three different types of hospitals together and to make it into a truly world-class centre.  There is no option but to make it work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#MM01500","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fitzpatrick.

Those who object to the site do so for many reasons.  The key objection at the present time relates to the absence of maternity co-location.  Other reasons are cited including cost, nationwide access, expansion capability and space, but the key issue is the absence of a maternity hospital co-location.  That is what will stop it being a world-class centre.  My argument is that if we are building the most expensive hospital in the world, and calling it a centre of excellence, and if it is going to be a world-class hospital, it should not exclude those babies who have the highest mortality rates, the children who need to have access to this.<\/p> <p>  The other issue in respect of Connolly Hospital is its range of specialty expertise in the context of its academic prowess.  St. James's Hospital, the Mater and St. Vincent's Hospital are at a different level in the support they would provide to a co-locating maternity hospital, and to a co-locating paediatric hospital.  Academically, and in terms of its medical specialties, St. James's hospital is the right site.  There was no ideal site for this.  We put in a proposal which was short-listed to the final three.  It was an imaginative proposal but the decision has been made.  There were flaws in how that decision was made but the one issue that will convert much of the angst, frustration and criticism of this site is to somehow ascertain whether it can accommodate a maternity hospital, which I believe it can.  There is a way of establishing flexible arrangements between the Coombe and St. James's Hospital can be achieved, and we should go ahead and do it.  Everyone would row in behind that.<\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of criticism of the project and the wow factor that should pertain to this hospital has been lost.  It needs to be rediscovered and we need to work together to make it happen.  My concern is that St. James's Hospital is a busy site academically and clinically.  It is fanciful to think that a space can be held or sterilised for five or ten years and then made available.  I am also concerned that if it goes on for years, some 200 babies annually will not have access to this hospital.  This figure will increase with increasing pre-natal diagnosis.  The Coombe is also seeing referrals from the North of Ireland.  This hospital will have a referral basis from the whole island of Ireland.  A lot of babies will lose out on this.  We need to get the co-location.  People are looking at the finances but somebody needs to look at the site and reassure everyone the maternity hospital will go in there.  It should be put in the capital plan with the design started now, whether it is done back-to-back or some works can be started in advance, but it should be prioritised in relation to St. James Hospital and the capital plan.  It currently exists nowhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#NN00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Professor Fitzpatrick mentioned the St. James's site and the building of a cancer centre or hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#NN00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>My understanding is that plans are being made to develop a cancer hospital at the St. James's site.  According to an <i>Irish Times <\/i>editorial, there is a need to address cancer issues in the hospital, which is the largest cancer hospital in the State.  That site has a maximum capacity.  What one would not want to happen is that in 2023, when the doors of the new paediatric hospital open, that there will be no space for a maternity hospital.  That is why I believe the space should be identified, along with planning, decanting and demolition issues, and that process should start now.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Health, asked for a planning application to be submitted at the same time for the children's hospital and the maternity hospital.  I am not certain why that did not happen.  It may have been because after the Mater site had failed planning, that were it made any more complex, it could fail planning again but it is time to grasp the nettle.  There is a total lack of credibility and trust on this.  Those of us who work on the front line in relation to babies feel that we have been sidelined regarding the patients whom we feel are important.<br\/><br\/>There is a way of dealing with this.  It is too late to stop the project.  Academically and in terms of the specialties, St. James's is the best place and we must make it work.  Regarding the space available and what it would entail in co-locating onto that site, flexibility could be put into place that would allow this to happen sooner rather than later.  The message needs to go out to all those who genuinely object to the site because of the absence of co-location that this is now a Government priority.<br\/><br\/>I am reluctant to throw out figures because I have seen back-of-the-envelope calculations before which were widely out of range.

Our paths have crossed and I alerted the committee that we know each other to an extent.  I thank Professor Fitzpatrick for the time he served as master of the Coombe hospital.  It is something people do and it is not often recognised.  It is a very important role and I have told the health committee previously that I am a big fan of the mastership model of care.  Professor Fitzpatrick will know that I have experience of having a child in a Dublin hospital who had to be transferred for the reasons Professor Fitzpatrick outlined.  The child was taken from me at birth and brought to Crumlin hospital.  That is not much of an effort when one is in Dublin and people might say, \"what about it?\".  However, Professor Fitzpatrick knows the risks involved in such transfers as well as the knock-on effects of having a child, handing it over to somebody else in a different hospital and being left alone.  It is not something people think about until they are in that situation.  The figures are stark that in that transfer period bad things can happen and children's lives are lost.<\/p> <p>  Before becoming involved in politics I was initially not in favour of the St. James's site but I bought into the idea based on the concept of the tri-location of an adult hospital, a paediatric hospital and a maternity hospital on the same site, supported by the sub-specialties Professor Fitzpatrick has discussed.  My argument for supporting the site diminishes, however, if there is no chance of a maternity hospital on site.  It is critical that a maternity hospital be on the site and I thank Professor Fitzpatrick for his clear argument today that it must happen and that it must start now so it is ready and fit for purpose as well as ticking the boxes for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and all that was planned from the start.  It is not the right site if there is no maternity hospital because that was one of the fundamental reasons for putting it there.<\/p> <p>  The cancer unit on the site concerns me.  In St. James's Hospital and through the cancer strategy we have very good survival rates for cancer now, and I will be discussing this later in the D&aacute;il.  If there is a space there for the cancer unit does Professor Fitzpatrick think it could be put somewhere else?  If he were to juggle the cancer unit and the maternity hospital, he appears to be saying today that the maternity hospital should get priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#OO00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I am not certain about where at the St. James's Hospital site the cancer hospital is going.  I would not wish to second guess or somehow inhibit the development of cancer services in St. James's Hospital.  I am a patient in St. James's Hospital as well, where I am very well looked after.  I believe it is possible to do all these things.  St. James's Hospital has a can do attitude.  It does things and is a very ambitious hospital.  I am saying that in that ambition we must make certain that there is a protected space, and the way to protect the space is to start doing something about it now and not to wait.  Basically, it would be a travesty of everything that has happened in this regard to find out a couple of years hence that we could not get planning for a hospital that should have been built at the start.  The flawed decision was not to put in a dual application at the start and have a co-build.  I believe we should examine how the fastest build can be achieved, what the site is, what the specification is and issues regarding access, but this work should start now.  The work must be funded because obviously we require experts to help us with it.  That process can start.<\/p> <p>  In terms of neonatal transport, we have a wonderful neonatal transport service.  However, it is recognised that babies decompensate during transport.  Certainly, the model of care that is recommended by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is that babies who have critical illnesses and pre-identified problems and who need to be transferred to a paediatric hospital ideally should go across a corridor rather than in an ambulance.  The term \"world class\" has often been bandied about in regard to this hospital, as well as its expense.  It behoves us to do it right and not find ourselves short changed.  Much of the criticism regarding this site relates to the absence of maternity co-location and a disbelief and lack of trust that it might happen.  I was speaking about this in 2006, 2012 and subsequently, but nothing has happened.  It is time to act.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the Committee of Public Accounts can recommend or what authority it has in this regard.  I appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health previously and I should have walked out asking for something.  I am asking for the strongest recommendation that the Committee of Public Accounts can give to accelerate the co-location of a maternity hospital on the St. James's Hospital site.  That would mean it would have been worthwhile for me to have appeared before the committee in that regard.  I do not know whether that is possible.  I like the consensus politics we have here at present when one considers what is happening abroad, and I believe there is a consensus on the fact that there is a need for a maternity hospital there.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the site, if we were to do it all again we might do it differently, but we are where we are on this.  I believe people want to work together and that they will contribute.  I will contribute whatever I can to it.  I have been critical of this for a long period of time.  Medicine is like politics in that one gets things done through compromise.  We must compromise on this and consider what the important thing is, which is a maternity hospital on that site.  If the committee can do anything to get it there quickly, I would be very grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#OO00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":549,"content":"<p>One could argue that it is not a world class hospital if the maternity hospital is not on site, in terms of the spend.

I am also a member of the health committee.  We have the maternity strategy and I am aware that Professor Fitzpatrick and many of his colleagues had an input into that.  One of the criticisms of the maternity strategy was that it separated obstetrics and gynaecology.  It is the separation of having babies and just being a woman, in layman's terms.  There are many Cinderellas in politics but gynaecology, as we have seen from the massive waiting lists, is often a Cinderella because women will put up with things where other people would not.  In terms of Professor Fitzpatrick's idea of leaving gynaecology in the Coombe and moving births onto the St. James's site, I am concerned that we would have a clinic or a building that might not be fit for purpose.

I do not believe so.  The issue with benign gynaecology is that it is deprioritised in the general hospitals.  It is very difficult.  A percentage of women with symptoms that are suggestive of benign disease will actually have an occult cancer.  Where women have, for example, problems with menstrual dysfunction and are on a waiting list to go into a maternity hospital or a general hospital, unfortunately a small percentage of them may change from pre-cancer conditions to cancer conditions because there is such a long delay in evaluating them, which is a tragedy.  The issue is the model of care we need for gynaecology care.  I am looking at the development of an integrated campus.  It is not that what would happen in the Coombe would be very different from what happens in St. James's.  The distance between our hospital and St. James's Hospital is less than the distance across St. James's Hospital.  Our vision is that over time this part of Dublin, and a great deal of spin-off development will happen with the paediatric hospital coming into it, will be a medical quarter and over 20 to 40 years both hospitals will grow together.<\/p> <p>  There are governance issues to be addressed, but the main thing is to focus on patient outcomes, quality of care, access and choice.  There is a wonderful opportunity to develop a customised gynaecology centre, an ambulatory centre, where women would have a range of treatments that are very difficult to access now.  The Coombe hospital currently has a submission with the HSE to develop a new day care centre to cater for all women's reproductive needs, in terms of a one-stop-shop with en suite scanning and so forth and procedures on the day of presentation.<\/p><p>That is a wonderful model.  It does not necessarily sit well in a cancer hospital.  The spatial organisation of a hospital has to be flexible and allow for a configuration of services in the right spaces.  Regarding space, if we moved our maternity hospital to St. James's Hospital, we would retain our gynaecology services as an integrated service across both sites.  What is currently needed in Dublin and in our hospital group network is ready access to day-case, ambulatory and short-stay gynaecology surgery.  Not only would that be possible in St. James's Hospital, it could be integrated with what is happening in Tallaght University Hospital, Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise and Naas General Hospital.  That would allow a network of care, not segregated but integrated.<\/p><p> I have seen issues around staff flexibility, concerning new contracts for nurses and midwives and how people work across sites.  I would like the Committee of Public Accounts and the Government to give impetus to prioritising the development of women's healthcare services and the co-location of a maternity hospital on the site of St. James's Hospital.  I am concerned with space, money, and providing the best possible access.  We can be flexible in how we could do that.

The vision was that the whole campus would work as a single campus.  I am concerned with what works.  The really important thing is to start to make it happen.  These are the questions we need to ask.  We need support from HSE estates and we need a design team.  We need to start planning this hospital now.  I have asked whether work could be done in advance, simultaneously to what is happening in the national children's hospital or back-to-back, but this needs to happen.  There must be a very strong message from the Government saying that the money will be found.  The problem with the overspend is that it will hit lots of things that are on the list to be done.  It could affect the co-location of the Coombe and St. James's Hospital.  Things are going to be cut because of the money lost in the national children's hospital project, and that is one of them.  That would be regrettable.  It would fulfil Deputy O'Connell's worst fears in that this would not end up being the hospital we planned.

Acquiring the national children's hospital would bring such kudos and status to a hospital that it would become the de facto national adult hospital.  There are several issues.  We were emerging from a recession so perhaps money was an issue.  The decision was made after a failed planning application to build on the Mater Hospital site.  Members may remember the visual imagery.  It was a very imaginative, almost surreal hospital in terms of magnitude.  When this was played out for a second time six years later, there was a fear that if the proposal for the St. James's Hospital site was overly complex it might fail to get planning permission.

From our point of view, they are the children with the greatest need.  Because of their fragility we felt the greatest commitment to advocating for them.  The number of children is small but the consequences of excluding them from this iconic trilocation are not.  I also refer to the exclusion of mothers.  We are very conscious of the fact that mothers now need access to adult sub-specialty services because of increasing risk, co-morbidities and body mass indices, BMIs.  This is needed for mothers and particularly for babies.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach asked for an application for a co-build in 2014.  That did not happen.  We can revisit the history and note that deadlines were missed and calculations were erroneous.  Starting from this point however, I would love for the committee to make a recommendation in its meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The board's PowerPoint presentations to this committee mentioned wider community spin-offs, such as raising educational aspirations in the community, benefit to businesses in the community and employment and training opportunities.  However there was not one mention of the Coombe or of babies, and we are down the road from that hospital.  To me, that symbolised the way babies and maternity hospitals were excluded from the process. As a maternity hospital, we do not have the same political clout and influence as the bigger hospitals.  I think that is the case for all maternity hospitals.  However, at the present time there is a willingness to make this work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#PP01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Fitzpatrick's presentation and his vision and ambition.  We all agree with it.  We have gone around in circles about this hospital for the guts of 20 years.  There was controversy about the Mater Hospital, we looked at a site in Crumlin and then we came to St. James's Hospital.  Many are still of the opinion that it should not be on any of those sites, but in a new greenfield site or outside Connolly Hospital.  Building on a greenfield site would avoid all the problems that we have in fitting into the St. James's Hospital site.  It would be a lot cheaper to build on a new site than to go in with bulldozers and starting on a brownfield site.<\/p> <p>  Is it bad planning?  The Taoiseach said in 2014 that we should have trilocation.  That should be our ambition; to have a general hospital, a children's hospital and a maternity hospital together, a corridor away from one another.  One could open a door and go from one to the other instead of trying to transport patients across Dublin in an emergency, or in my constituents' case, all the way from Waterford or Kilkenny.  What Professor Fitzpatrick is saying makes sense.  He has covered this already, but why are we only now talking about the third part of the trilocation project?  Why was a maternity hospital not part of the recent planning for the national children's hospital?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the overspend.  We do not have the remit to make the recommendations Professor Fitzpatrick seeks.  This is the Committee of Public Accounts.  We follow the money when it is spent and make sure it is spent correctly.  We cannot recommend how money is spent.  That is not our remit.<\/p><p>We cannot tell the Government what to do, what decisions to make on policies or how to spend money.  It is our job to ensure money is spent to the taxpayers' benefit and value for money is achieved.  <\/p><p> On the site, is it large enough to facilitate the three hospitals and all of the associated facilities such as parking?  I am aware of the rail connection, but last week I read an article in one of the newspapers regarding the problems experienced by a man from rural Ireland trying to get into St. James's Hospital.  People are experiencing problems accessing the St. James's site even before the children's hospital has been built there or consideration given to the location of the maternity hospital there.  When all of that work is completed there will be even bigger problems in this area in terms of traffic congestion and parking.  The ambition is positive but is it possible to have all three facilities at this location?  There are many professionals in this country.  Why was the survey not undertaken before the JCBs were allowed on site?  The cost of the national children's hospital has increased from &euro;600 million to &euro;1.7 million and may increase further.  Is this another case of bad planning?  Was there no proper analysis of the site in its totality?  It is frustrating and annoying to hear that there may not be room for the maternity hospital on this site.

Medically, it would not work.  Space-wise, co-location-wise in terms of how to do it and access-wise, it works.  That is the issue.  What weighted the decision strongly in relation to St. James's Hospital is the fact that it is the largest adult hospital in the State and that cannot be undermined.  It is also the largest academic hospital in the State and that cannot be undermined.  In terms of what I would do, I would turn it on its head.  The decision is made.  We are now well into the project and massive excavation has been carried out.  The site should be stress tested now to ensure a maternity hospital can be co-located on it.  The money that this will cost is small fry given all the money that has been wasted.  We need to be absolutely certain that a maternity hospital can be provided on the site and then do it as quickly as possible.  There would be issues in terms of access and parking but the bottom line is the medicine and care that would be provided would be at the level that we aspire to.  It is a compromise.  If  the choice is access and double parking versus having the best people in the best place providing the best service I would put up with double parking.  That is not, I suppose, ideal, but this in the end is a compromise.  We have started it and I think it is too late to stop.  I want to make absolutely certain that a maternity hospital is provided.  I am looking at flexible ways this could be done in terms of space, cost and delivery.  If the remit of the committee is to ensure that money is spent appropriately, expenditure should not continue on this site with the expectation that it is going to deliver a maternity hospital if it cannot be proven that it will.  That work needs to start now otherwise value for money will not be achieved and a fortune will be wasted on this project only to find out that it has not delivered what it set out to deliver.  <\/p> <p>  I share the committee's concerns.  I have been neutral on the location of this hospital and I have advocated that it should go to Connolly Hospital when there were issues with space and access.  We are where we are and we need to deliver this hospital.  We need to bring people together to solve the problems that exist and accelerate the solution.  In the end, if the maternity hospital, the children's hospital, the adult hospital, the training, the teaching, the education and the innovation are there, all of which one wants in a brilliant health care centre, that could be the best thing in the world.  There may be a payoff in terms of access and parking but those issues could be sorted out in time.  Cities evolve and space around hospitals evolves.

The initial expressions of interest in the children's hospital in 2006 favoured its location on an adult hospital site.  Shortly after, due to representation by the children's hospitals and by the maternity hospitals, that was opened to include the provision of a maternity hospital.  In regard to the Mater project, it was a tri-location of the Mater hospital, the children's hospital and the Rotunda Hospital.  In regard to the St. James's Hospital project, it was the Coombe, St. James's Hospital and the children's hospital.  Every adult hospital that pitched to have the children's hospital on its site emphasised the importance of having a maternity hospital there.  The St. James's Hospital pitch for it included space for a maternity hospital with a footprint that would deliver a hospital of 42,000 sq. m., which was significant.  It was an important issue.  The reason it was not included in the planning permission at that time was, perhaps, cost and a little bit of fear in relation to making it too complex.  The Coombe does not have the same punching power as the adult hospitals.  It is their site and the Coombe is moving on-site and so we do not have control over what is happening.  Unfortunately, despite our very good relationship with St. James's Hospital I think we were sidelined in relation to it and sidelined also by politicians.  The problem with this project is that there are so many recriminations in relation to it.  The past is the past and we need to learn from the experience.

The problem is that all three have been operating above capacity for a long time.  Not only are they maternity hospitals, they are neonatal centres and gynaecology hospitals.  Where the three need to be has already been decided.  One is to be in St. Vincent's.  That was the neatest fit because of the fact that St. Vincent's was never going to have the paediatric hospital.  When the Mater was the designated site for the children's hospital, the Rotunda was to move to the Mater.  Since the site changed, the Rotunda is now instead to move to Connolly hospital.  Three hospitals are needed in Dublin.  I do not think we could ever get to the stage where we could rationalise them down to two.  We support what is happening in the other two hospitals.  The critical thing is that the big project is the children's hospital.  One cannot build a hospital that does not deliver what one sets out to deliver, especially if one spends more money on it than on any hospital in the world.

The money that this will cost is insignificant in the context of what has been wasted to date on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#SS02300","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I am glad that Professor Fitzpatrick said that.

In international terms, the statistics from the maternity services in Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland are exceptionally good, although there are obviously cases where adverse circumstances happened that, looking back, could have been avoided.  One of the things we have been very concerned about over a long period of time is the resourcing of the maternity hospitals.  I cannot remember how many reports came out when I was master of the hospital which made recommendations for co-location, recommendations in terms of staff, recommendations in terms of infrastructure, etc., but very few of them were delivered.  We have a women and infants healthcare programme, which is still cash strapped.  We have the lowest number of obstetricians in the OECD.  These are issues that need to be addressed, but I think front-loading the maternity services with money improves outcome, improves quality of care and reduces adverse outcomes, and in reducing adverse outcomes, it reduces medical legal claims.  In terms of escalating medical legal claims, the way around that is to front-load investment into the service, and that, in a sense, would minimise risk.  The answer is \"Yes\" in terms of the development of new hospitals and new models of care and improving staffing levels and attracting people back from abroad who have gone away to train because they are looking at our maternity hospitals and are saying that they will not come back from Toronto or Sydney because they are working in state-of-the-art, tri-located centres.  Why would they come back?  <\/p> <p>  There may be difficulties recruiting people to work in the children's hospital, because they have seen a hospital mired in controversy.  To get the best and the brightest to come back to this country to work in our maternity and paediatric services, we need to deliver to them what they require in terms of infrastructure.  That is for the mothers and babies, not for the staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#TT00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1554969600,"counter":647,"content":"<p>Professor Fitzpatrick talking about outcomes for patients brings us nicely into the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have been dealing with the State Claims Agency and there is about &euro;2 billion in cases there relating to medical negligence, the vast majority of which relate to obstetrics.  In view of this conversation, we will send the transcript to the State Claims Agency and see if it can respond.  We have asked it for a breakdown of that on a hospital-by-hospital basis, but it is reluctant to do that because it might give a hospital a bad name if it is hit by five or six serious claims worth &euro;50 million.  In terms of reducing claims and providing a better service, there is information in the system that people do not want released for other purposes, but that would be a valuable source of information to help people make important decisions in this regard.  Ultimately, prevention of some of these serious incidents is the best outcome for everyone, with no legal and medical bills coming five or six years down the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019041100002#TT00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1554969600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>In terms of the hospital's relationship with the State Claims Agency, it is not just the issue of indemnity in the finances that it deals with.
