It breaks down to approximately &euro;9.3 billion in current expenditure and &euro;941 million in capital expenditure.<\/p><p>The non-voted national training fund has an allocation of &euro;486 million, resulting in a total gross allocation for the Department of Education and Skills of nearly &euro;10.8 billion.  This represents a substantial increase of nearly &euro;680 million, which is more than 6.7% above my Department's allocation for 2018.  The Department's Vote comprises three programmes: early years, primary, and post-primary; skills development; and higher education.  In previous years there was a separate capital services programme, but capital subheads have now been incorporated into the other three programmes.  <\/p><p> The additional allocation in 2019 will deliver a range of measures in the education and training system.  It will support an additional 1,300 posts in schools including approximately 950 special needs assistant, SNA, posts and approximately 370 net additional teacher posts, catering for demographics and additional special classes.  Schools will receive a 5% increase in capitation with an increase of &euro;10 million in school funding over the 2019-20 school year.  This is the first increase in the standard rate of capitation since the period of reduction in capitation rates that took place from 2011 to 2015.  We will be investing in improving outcomes for children with additional care needs, with &euro;4.75 million allocated to commence the implementation of the comprehensive SNA review.  School leadership will be supported with additional release days for teaching principals and the allocation of administrative deputy principal posts in special schools.  The Department's capital budget will be at its highest ever level, at &euro;941 million, in 2019.  This is an increase of more than 26% on last year.  More than &euro;670 million will be invested in schools, including investment in ICT, and more than &euro;150 million will be invested in the tertiary education and training system.  The Department's allocation includes a package of nearly &euro;99 million in measures in the tertiary education system.  This includes nearly &euro;70 million in funding arising from an increase in the national training fund levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#C00300","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It may be more useful if we proceeded programme by programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#D00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#D00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We will stick to programme A, which relates to primary, secondary and early years education.

Is it part of the reason that there was a large capital budget this year given the fact that the growth in the number of additional primary and post-primary school places being provided is slowing, as is spending per student on enhancement and replacement of post-primary school facilities?  Are there other reasons for it?  Is there a focus on projects that are necessary but more expensive?  Does it relate to site costs in urban areas?  What are the reasons for the higher capital budget when the out-turns do not seem to be appreciating at the same rate?  Could any efficiencies be identified in projects earmarked for delivery in 2019?  Will the Minister tell us how many students will be moved from prefabs to permanent accommodation in 2019 as a result of the capital budget?<\/p> <p>  The Minister's capital budget provides for extra funding for school laboratories and physical education, PE, halls.  Have those projects already been applied for?  Are the schools aware of the projects that are being funded this year?  Has planning permission been received for any or all of these projects?  Are all of the science laboratories and PE halls provided for due for completion in 2019?<\/p> <p>  On current expenditure, we had an issue before with regard to the number of pensioners.  The figures seem to be the exact same this year as for last year.  Will the Minister explain that?  What changes have happened in the calculation of these figures?  We were promised that this would all change and that there would be better preparation and better work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but the figures seem to be exactly the same.

In respect of the figures we were given, I understandably took a look at those which went down rather than up for 2019.  One of these is subhead A7, which relates to the salaries, wages and allowances of non-teaching staff in primary and post-primary schools.<\/p><p>There has been considerable concern about secretarial and caretaking staff, particularly those who are not paid directly by the Department.  Will the Minister clarify if they are included in this statistic or if there is a separate allocation on account of the fact that they are paid directly by the school?  They are in a much less advantageous position than others working in the same school.<\/p><p> There is a 2% reduction in the allocation for teacher education, which seems to be mostly continuing professional development, CPD, and related to the running of education centres.  Will the Minister explain why there is a reduction?  There is an increase of 15% under subhead A15 for primary and post-primary infrastructure.  As it includes temporary school premises, can the Minister say if there is still widespread use of prefabs and whether there has been a significant increase or decrease in the length of time students have to spend in prefabs while waiting for the provision of more long-term school buildings?  It is of concern to all of us that some children spend a large number of their school years in prefabs.  There is a policy to reduce the length of time they spend in prefabs, but how successful have we been in achieving this?  One needs prefabs when they are required for urgent use because the population in a given area is growing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#E01000","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Will the Minister increase capitation grants for schools in the next budget?

Our focus is on the capital programme for the period 2016 to 2019 which is for planned school projects, extensions and other construction works.  The Acting Chairman said there had been a reduction in the number of new school places throughout the country.  He is obviously aware of the pressures in his constituency.<\/p><p>Our guesstimates are made on a mathematical basis, using geographical information systems and in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the local authorities.  We try to identify where the pressure points will be.  My predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton, announced 42 new schools in places where we projected an increase in population.  When I was in Gorey two weeks ago, I met a number of primary school principals who were very anxious about the availability of secondary school places, not this year or next year but in three to five years' time.  There is an acute awareness of the pressure points in terms of where the next growth centres will be.  That is why it is important we keep all of our projections, estimates and data under constant review.<\/p><p> There was a point made about different standards and specifications.  In the past two or three years there has been increased emphasis on the environmental sustainability of buildings.  We are putting a stronger focus on ensuring the design of buildings is in keeping with environmental considerations.  Design teams now have to have such factors at the heart of their work.<\/p><p> On the use of prefabs, in 2018-19 there will be over 130 large-scale projects, or 38% of the 340 projects referred to, in addition to 280 smaller scale projects and the additional accommodation scheme.  They will deliver 40,000 school places and provide for the replacement of over 600 prefabs, a key element of the prefab replacement programme.  I was asked how many students would be involved.  I will be happy to obtain the data for the committee at a later stage.<\/p><p> Another question concerned school laboratories, physical education halls and home economics facilities upgrades.  There is constant reconfiguration of internal parts of buildings, whether they are engineering rooms, art rooms or school laboratories.  With specific reference to PE halls, we are looking to the next ten-year capital plan.  We will introduce a pilot PE leaving certificate option in all schools by 2020 because there is weak infrastructure in PE hall provision throughout the country.  We are looking to move forward in that regard.<\/p><p> There is no point putting in place comprehensive PE infrastructure at secondary level if it is not done hand-in-glove in primary schools.  Throughout rural Ireland there are primary schools on the backs of hills that are not near community centres, parochial halls or parish centres.  We really need to focus on the sports infrastructure we want to provide at primary school level because the statistics suggest half of all girls drop out of physical activity when they reach the age of 12 or 13 years.  If we offer leaving certificate physical literacy or physical education classes when many of the target cohort have already dropped out, it will be a major challenge.  A body of work needs to be done in that regard.  Schools are being very creative and some have introduced sports in we used to participate, including rounders and skipping, in addition to rugby, Gaelic football and soccer.<\/p><p> We need to keep a focus on the differences between physical education and physical activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#F00500","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>In the Revised Estimates 48 PE halls and 200 laboratories are provided for this year.<\/p><p>What is the procedure for getting one of these PE halls replaced or refurbished?

When I go to primary schools and meet the secretaries, I find that they are very modest in highlighting the role they play.  However, they play an integral part of the school.  I met a school secretary in Drumshanbo in Leitrim yesterday.  The principal outlined all the work she does.  I am conscious that a body of work needs to be done there.

I am conscious that the day-to-day running of schools, including things such as oil, is a big issue.  The 5% increase in capitation was a start in the right direction.  I am conscious that it certainly is not far enough.<\/p> <p>  Improvements to the caretakers and secretaries grant were made in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 to enable schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers, to pay increases for cleaners and to implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  While there have been increases, I am conscious of the issue of the stability and certainty around the role of caretaking staff and some secretarial staff.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also made reference to replacement of prefabs.  I have been to many primary schools where some fifth and sixth class pupils have spent all their primary school education in prefabs.  Some of them are not in great shape but the schools are waiting for the new build or new extension to come along.<\/p><p>While much patience has been shown, sometimes that patience reaches a limit when it comes to trying to get the education environment in a good place.  We need to keep a strong focus on adapting the building suitability for autistic students and those with special needs, as is happening in some of the newer primary and secondary schools.<\/p><p> Deputy McLoughlin spoke about the capitation increase from last year and asked about next year's budget.  I am conscious that it was reduced by 11% in 2011, which was a big hit for schools.  While we have come back up by 5%, I acknowledge a body of work remains to be done there.  I discuss this with my officials weekly.  I re-emphasise - I know it is also coming from this committee - the importance of capitation.  We will look at that in the context of the next budget.<\/p><p> We will have an additional 950 SNAs this year, which will bring the cohort of SNAs up to about 16,000.  We have increased teaching staff by 372 this year.  That is part of an overall increase to the effectiveness of schools.  Yesterday in Scoil Naomh P&aacute;draig in Drumshanbo, the principal pointed out that the SNAs there keep the school moving.  That is how intrinsically linked they are to the school.  They do not work in silos and are very much part of that.  I am anxious to push ahead with the SNA recommendation.  We will look at a pilot in that area and I want to see more integration between the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  We will make that happen.  We will do a pilot in September.  We will look at key issues that were raised in this committee in my first week in the job about dealing with cases where a clinical nurse, a speech and language professional or an occupational therapist is needed.  We need to work in a more collective way on that.  That pilot will be the signalling post for how we develop in the future.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about school transport.  Anyone living in a rural constituency will know the phones start ringing in the last week in August.  There are issues.  In defence of Bus &Eacute;ireann, it has a mammoth task every year.  The numbers change every year with new people coming in and other people leaving.  Bus &Eacute;ireann obviously works within the rules and guidelines of the policy it is given.  I am working with the officials on the school transport area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has been very proactive in this area in applying more common sense in the area.  I know Deputy Funchion has raised this issue in respect of her constituency.  Sometimes local people can come up with a common-sense solution, but sometimes if the wall of policy comes up against them it can lead to unbelievable frustration.  I am very conscious we need to try to protect the integrity of certain parishes as best we can and the integrity of traditional school choice.  Sometimes the closest school might not be the traditional school of choice for many people.  When this change came in in 2012, it got rid of the closed school amalgamation rule.  It caused considerable upset in communities and I am working very closely with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#H01000","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Unfortunately I have to put this on the record.

That is a welcome step.<\/p><p>I hope progress will be made because it is a big issue, one we continue to come across.<\/p><p> I wish to ask about special needs assistants.  We can see that they have been increasing in number.  The number provided is an estimated 15,950.  Does this figure come from the National Council for Special Education?  I am not querying it, but we still come across an awful lot of cases in which children, for whatever reason, may have to switch schools during school term, for example, at this time of year.  It could perhaps be down to there being some blockage in the system or a lack of common sense when it comes to dealing with these issues.  The children are told that if they switch school, they will not be able to have a special needs assistant until September.  Does the Minister have any information on this matter?  There are also cases in which the provision of a special needs assistant is recommended in the various reports people receive from psychologists, but the SENO overrules that recommendation.  Sometimes I wonder about the power SENOs have in making these decisions.  A number of professionals in the medical world might say a child would benefit from having access to a special needs assistant, but then the SENOs will say no.  They never seem to have to give any detailed reason to a parent for the refusal, which can be quite difficult.  In our area there are two SENOs; therefore, there is not much wiggle room to speak to anyone else about the isue, but it still comes up.  Even though we have heard - it is a welcome development - special needs assistants are increasing in number, it seems there are still issues in certain areas.  Can this matter be raised with the National Council for Special Education?  It might not even have to do with the number of special needs assistants available; it could have to do with a breakdown in the system.  I wanted to take the opportunity to ask about this issue.

As we are dealing with the programme that covers salaries, I will call out the elephant in the room - pay inequality.  I am aware of the ruling of the European Court of Justice in recent weeks.  I would say the Government was pleased with it.  On the issue of age discrimination, it indicated that it was based more on the date of entry into a position, but that is a technicality when we all know that the vast majority of new entrants are young people.  It is young teachers who are continually being sold out.  The arrangement worked out by the Government in September which will take effect soon does not address the fundamental underlying issue, that is, the concept of equal pay for equal work.  Unlike his predecessor, I ask the Minister to recognise that principle.  Yesterday I read with interest the news of the job-sharing scheme for teachers.  Perhaps it is a necessary move. but it fundamentally misses the point as to why over 90% of schools are struggling to recruit teachers.  The reason is pay discrimination.  One cannot have partial equality, which is what seems to be envisioned by the Government's approach.  One cannot have a situation where everyone is equal but some are more equal than others.  That is how young teachers feel.  Therefore, I really urge the Minister to commit to recognising the principle of equal pay for equal work.  Recruitment and retention are issues because of the cost facing graduates of pursuing a two-year professional master's in education degree.<\/p><p>They are also a problem because of the working conditions, the initiative overload, with document after document and change after change coming in, the quality of resources, the facilities in the schools, the need for a supplementary panel and, needless to say, the class sizes.<\/p><p> Another point is the superannuation section under this heading.  In recent years we have approved substantial Supplementary Estimates every year to deal with unexpected expenditure and every year we bring this up.  Has the Minister managed to sort out this anomaly?  I would be grateful if he would provide an update on plans to develop a sustainable superannuation forecasting and funding model and a timeline for its completion.<\/p><p> Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Thomas Byrne brought up the issue of PE halls.  I know the Minister said he was conscious of the fact that there is weak infrastructure.  I would like a little more light shed on this because since my election to the D&aacute;il, I have asked for an audit of all schools so we can establish exactly how many schools do not have PE halls.  However, every time I table this question there is a refusal to answer it.  Yes, there is one in my constituency but there are others.  I just do not understand how PE can be rolled out fairly and equally when there are students without PE halls, so I ask again for that audit.<\/p><p> I welcome the funding being allocated to well-being, following our own report on positive mental health in schools, including the funding for ten additional education psychologists.  Does the Minister have plans to increase these numbers in the future?<\/p><p> Finally, while the Minister is here, I wish to bring up the recent call for geography to be restored as a core subject in the junior cycle curriculum.  I welcome that he is reviewing the dropping of history.  I really plead with him to review the decision to remove geography as a core subject too.  We have students outside Leinster House every Friday.  We have a movement for climate strike across the world led by Greta Thunberg on 15 March.  Our students get it.  Geography is crucial in educating our students on one of the most urgent issues facing humankind, and it is shocking that this Government would move to remove geography as a core subject.  I ask the Minister to reconsider, as he did with history, the removal of geography and to please restore it as a core subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#K00900","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions and observations.  I will start with Deputy Funchion's queries.  We covered transportation but I will give her a few figures.  She asked about the amount of money involved yearly.  The cost of the school transport scheme in 2018 amounted to &euro;200 million.  This is an increase from over &euro;171 million in 2011.  The main reason for this increase in cost is the provision of special educational needs transport, which now accounts for over 50% of the total cost of the scheme.  I am quite conscious that many of our very vulnerable young people have to travel large distances to get to the appropriate school.  This is very evident when I visit mainstream schools and special schools.<\/p> <p>  The number of children on special educational needs, SEN, transport has increased from 9,200 pupils in 2013 to more than 13,000 pupils in 2018.  This is reflected in the increase in classes as well.  The number of special classes has gone from 475 to about 1,500 this year.  The cost of the provision of SEN transport has increased from just over &euro;60 million in 2011 to &euro;106 million in 2018.  Lastly, for the purpose of the public record of the committee, the main cost of contractors providing SEN services rose from around &euro;42 million in 2011 to &euro;73 million in 2018.  The cost of the provision of school bus escorts has gone from &euro;15 million to &euro;29 million in 2018.<\/p><p>That is not where the complication is.  As the Deputy correctly identified, the complication relates to school transport and getting children to a traditional school of choice or a school that respects the integrity of their area.  That is mainly a matter for primary level.  The changes we are seeking to make relate to second level schools.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to special needs assistants and complications there and used the term \"blockage in the system\".  The people who come to my constituency office are waiting for a diagnosis report.  I want to get away from that as do the members of the committee.  We all want the same model whereby the school is profiled rather than to have one-to-one special needs assistance.  One of the key recommendations of the SNA review was around the stigmatisation and alienation children in fourth, fifth and sixth class feel with one-to-one SNA provision.  That is at one level.  The Deputy was talking about the more complex area.  I want to focus on the pilot project we will commence in September to see how we can take a more integrated approach to identify a young person's needs at preschool level rather than to require parents to go through the hardship and difficulty of dealing with matters at the first point of entry into primary school.  A great deal of the knowledge, data and intelligence the system has at preschool should determine what happens at primary school.  It is about reprofiling the schools whereby the school does not rely on demand-led, one-to-one assessment or diagnosis.  We need to get away from that system.<\/p><p> I hope through our vigilance at political level, we can consider how to take a more joined-up approach, including to the training SNAs need.  Even where children have complex medical needs, parents want their children to be in a mainstream setting.  They want that choice and we should be able to afford it to them.  However, it will require the training of SNAs.  We do not have a higher training authority for SNAs currently but that will go hand in glove with the pilot project.  It will ensure the experience SNAs have built up over the last two decades will be taken into account where they seek to retrain and equip themselves with the skills needed for more complex cases.  They will be afforded the opportunity to do that.  Many SNAs want certainty.  Trying to find a job is difficult.  I hear from my colleagues nationally that even though we have 16,000 SNAs, representing a 45% increase since 2011, that uncertainty continues to exist because the SNA follows the student instead of working under a whole-school model which provides greater long-term certainty.  That is the place I want to get to.  With the committee's help, there will be other areas in which we can work together.<\/p><p> Deputy Naughton raised the matter of DEIS schools.  DEIS schools were selected on a geographical basis.  As a result, geographical areas which did not fall into particular socioeconomic categories were completely left out.  I have received a lot of representations from schools which are not in the DEIS programme.  Whereas in the past DEIS status was somewhat of a stigma and schools were questioning whether or not to enter the scheme, we have the opposite situation now.  Schools that have DEIS status want to maintain it and those without it want it because they see how it contributes to the development of the individual child.   We have collected all the data and will be ready at the end of the first quarter of 2019 to carry out a demographic and socioeconomic analysis of the country with a view to putting in place a more gradual and targeted approach to DEIS.  It will require a great deal of work to ensure we meet the needs of the most vulnerable in schools.  It is a matter of different DEIS bands for some schools while other schools see value in home-school liaison.  There is a meal programme and other extra resources to address class size, for example.  All of these provide added advantages for a school.  One of the things I will make an integral part of the three-year plan for the Department is bridging the gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools.  It is already happening to an extent, but there is more we can do to advance the process.<\/p><p>The other thing is to look at progression.  We are very lucky in where we have got to in the space of ten years.  For example, staff at Larkin Community College in Dublin city centre tell me they now have an 80% progression rate to diploma, apprenticeship and higher and third level education.  It represents massive progress at that DEIS school.  A lot of schools are aiming to replicate that achievement and I want to look at a more targeted approach to help them.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin referred to new entrant teachers and equal pay for equal work.  I am on the public record as saying there is unfinished business in this regard.  Obviously, we are working within the parameters of the public sector stability agreement.  I am conscious of the fact one creates that vulnerability in a staff room setting where some people around the table for a cup of tea are getting less money than others to do the same job.  It is a negative of which I am conscious.  The unions are working on this and it is something I have discussed with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I am also conscious that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has been through this in the context of the recent nurses' strike.  I want to create a pathway whereby we have done work prior to the end of 2020 to bring about this resolution.  There were changes in 2011 to the grade at which primary and secondary school teachers came into the system.  It is about acknowledgement of the higher diploma in education for secondary teachers and of the post-graduate certificate of education which primary school teachers hold.  I want to continue to work within the framework of the public service stability agreement to see how we can move towards a place in the next round where this is eliminated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#L00200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Towards equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Can I clarify that the Minister means the next round of pay talks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Yes, at the end of 2020.

However, I am conscious of the fact that they took a reduction.  To acknowledge the higher diploma and primary teaching qualification will cost &euro;43 million.  These are the figures we are looking at and must work with within the existing mechanisms.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin referred to the jobsharing scheme yesterday.  Education and training boards worked with that scheme in the 1970s and some secondary schools have engaged in jobsharing on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis more recently.

If there is a maths teacher in a base school on 12 hours and the whole school is looking for seven hours, common sense can be applied and joined-up thinking can be engaged in.  Principals who spot that opportunity will go for it.  Having spoken to them, I know it is about timetabling.  If there are distances involved, the teacher has to be compensated for the time spent travelling and the interruption to his or her day.  Where teacher approval is being granted by the Department, officials have to ensure the teacher does not have to travel during the day.  It should be about going to one of the schools on one day and the other on another day.  I re-emphasise, however, that it is not a solution to the teacher supply issue overall, albeit I encourage principals to work on it.  I know they will.  Deputy Martin also mentioned recruitment and retention which is a big issue.<\/p><p>Looking at the new courses, especially the masters courses we introduced this year in Mary Immaculate College, and at other courses at undergraduate level, it takes time to do that.  As a strong advocate of returning to education, I am also conscious that it is very difficult for somebody who is in the circle of paying bills and mortgages to go back to it full-time.  We increased the funding for student support this year as well.  I am conscious of the retention issue.  There are initiatives within the teacher supply consortium that is up and running, but I wish to examine ways of trying to address the issue that there are a number of teachers in the south east of England and in the United Arab Emirates.  We must be practical in the conversations we have with them.  It is not necessarily to encourage them because many teachers are waiting for the prospect of getting a job.  It is the not knowing, certainty around that and when interviews are held.  I am doing a piece of work with my officials on that.<\/p><p> The Deputy spoke about initiative overload.  That is something I am hearing about from the staff room.  A great deal of change is happening, much of it good.  The schools I visit around the country are doing the well-being part very well.  They are considering creative ways.  They are doing the social inclusion part.  Teaching is happening in a very holistic way in schools.  Central to the way teaching is taking place today, from my observations, is the dignity and respect piece in the school setting, that is, the way teachers respect young people, young people respect teachers, respecting the whole school environment, having parents and the community front and centre and the integration of business not just within secondary schools but also within primary schools.  We can learn a great deal from what is happening in schools for developing our policies.  The well-being policy is working very well.  It is trying to get students in touch with their issues and to be honest and upfront about the challenges they face.<\/p><p> The Deputy spoke about the audit of all schools.  A piece of work was done a number of years ago on an audit of all school buildings.  Secondary schools are probably in a better position than primary schools.  It is a big piece of work.  I emphasised that there is a weakness in this infrastructure and we must try to find a way of doing it.  If we were to use the full &euro;8.4 billion on building gymnasiums in all 4,000 primary and secondary schools, it would not be enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00700","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>How many second level schools in Ireland do not have a PE hall?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#O00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I can get the Deputy that number.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#O00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#O00400","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to funding for well-being.

There has been a big change in the way we look at history in the last four to five years.  I believe 2016 contributed to that.  There is a yearning to find out more about our past.

The Apprenticeship Council has been rolling out new types of apprenticeships in conjunction with industry and higher and further education.  Are there any more new programmes to come?  Are more planned for this year?  I refer particularly to the tourism sector, where there is still a lot of reliance on people coming in from outside to work in the sector.  I know there are apprenticeships in that area and that there are also some very good training programmes.  I am aware of one in my own constituency, provided by the Limerick Enterprise Development Partnership, LEDP, which is run through the ETB.  It is a relatively short training programme that does an excellent job and gives young people really good opportunities to work.  I want to ask the Minister about the growth of that whole area.

In 2017, the Department targeted 13 new apprenticeship programmes and the outturn was 11.  Last year, the target was reduced to ten and this year the target is 35.  It has been very slow progress.  If we make 35 extra programmes this year it will be fantastic, but is the Minister confident this will happen given that we are coming from an extremely low base?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#S00600","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the members.  I will respond to Deputy Catherine Martin ar dt&uacute;s.  On female participation, the Deputy pointed to the positive aspects and asked why this is happening.  We have to be in the realistic space as well; we have a lot more to do there.  A number of reports have highlighted that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is still low, which is reflective of the traditionally low levels of female employment in the craft sector.  I have had preliminary discussions with a number of officials in SOLAS on this issue.<\/p><p>Sometimes in life, the things that are staring us straight in the face are the things we may take for granted.  In my own county, SOLAS is looking at the traditional craft sector to see what it can do in respect of apprenticeships.  SOLAS offers a bursary to craft employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices but the uptake by women is still very low.  To provide a few more figures, at the end of 2018 there were 341 female apprentices registered, more than double the 2017 figure of 151.  That is the positive aspect to which the Deputy alluded.  While this is welcome, it is also important to address issues influencing the low level of recruitment of women in the craft sector.  SOLAS has completed a review of the pathways to participation in apprenticeship for under-represented groups, including women.  Areas highlighted for action include setting targets for female participation, considering extending the craft employer bursary to other apprenticeships with less than 20% female participation, and a specific focus on female participation as part of the Generation Apprenticeship national promotional campaign.  Women now feature prominently in all aspects of the national promotional campaign, where there is a specific focus on encouraging women and girls to consider apprenticeships as a means of launching or developing their careers.<\/p><p> We will be doing the career guidance review in the coming weeks and a number of suggestions have been made through this committee on career guidance.  We have a body of work on how we can support career guidance teachers more in terms of the information they have.  The information available at junior certificate and leaving certificate level is critical, including information about different industries, apprenticeships, a higher diploma or higher education.  We have to be aware than an information vacuum can exist.  This is not the fault of the career guidance teachers.  There could be one career guidance teacher for a whole school and he or she is not going to be able to develop individual career paths for every student.  We must address how to make that information more accessible to the student cohort.<\/p><p> I am aware that they do something very collaborative in Limerick.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan might be able to shed a wee bit more light on that.  I only found out about it from my trip to Limerick.  They bring together the third level institutions, the ETB, SOLAS, all the different stakeholders and the young people in a single environment once a year.  That type of information sharing is so important.  Returning to Deputy Catherine Martin's question, the future skills forum is also contributing to this dissemination of information.  It is done on a regional basis, which is critical.  When I was in Drumshanbo yesterday, I came across two more potential apprenticeships there, one in the area of beauty and healthcare and the other in organic farming.  They are really tapping into the possibilities around tourism as well, which Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned.  <\/p><p> On the National Training Fund and the human capital issue, from January 2020 a new ring-fenced funding line, the human capital initiative, will be established within the National Training Fund to invest &euro;60 million per annum from the accumulated surplus over a five-year period.  This ring-fenced allocation will total &euro;300 million over the period from 2020 to 2024.  It will form a key part of the strategic response to Brexit and other challenges.  Deputy McLoughlin mentioned funding for apprenticeships.  I acknowledge the role played by all the different service providers in this area.  The 2019 budget allocation for apprenticeship training is &euro;142 million, which represents an increase of over 16% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;122 million.  The 2019 allocation is apportioned between SOLAS, which is allocated &euro;105 million, and the HEA, which is allocated &euro;37 million.  It will support an apprenticeship population forecast to be in excess of 18,000 by the end of 2019, and new registrations forecast to be in excess of 7,000 in the same year.<\/p><p>The findings of a recent study that appeared in<i>The Irish Times<\/i>showed that multinational companies held in equal esteem graduates from higher level institutions and universities and from apprenticeships.  We have to ensure we continue to sent the message to young people that the race for points to go to university will not be a perfect fit for all students.  The great work being done in promoting apprenticeships is central to the conversation.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised an issue about funding from the European Social Fund.  I remember that the applications for funding from some Youthreach programmes had not been submitted in time.  I have raised this matter with my officials and efforts will be made to try to ensure we will not have to wait for a Supplementary Estimate to be presented.<br\/><br\/>The Acting Chairman raised an issue about the provision being made for the payment of pensions.  A great deal of work goes into coming up with figures for how many teachers will retire, but the reason we had to present a Supplementary Estimate for &euro;144 million was insufficient money had been put aside in the initial Estimate.  I am confident that the Department will be in position this year because of the new increased baseline figure of &euro;1.35 billion.  My three predecessors in the Department since 2011 evaluated correctly the figures for the numbers who would retire, but the resources were not available in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the reason the Department had to prepare a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#S00700","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>What the Minister has just said is that the Department knew how many teachers would be retiring but did not provide for it in the Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>No, the Department estimated the numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>It did not provide for them because it had to present a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The Department had to have a conversation with the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform to obtain sanction to incur the expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00500","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Therefore, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned funding that was less than expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00600","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>It was not a question of sanctioning funding that was less than expenditure; it was a case of meeting expenditure within the available resources.

There are schemes available to support students with disabilities to gain access.  It is one of the conversations that I had with the president of the University of Limerick.  It is an ongoing conversation I also have had recently with presidents of institutes of technology in Galway, Sligo and Letterkenny, as to how we can get better in terms of access.  I will forward the figure on the percentage of school leavers to the Deputy.

I met a professor recently who said much research has gone into this but it could come down to simple factors such as environment and physical accessibility to buildings, and we should keep that first and foremost in mind.<\/p><p> There was a question on the percentage of women in senior academic roles.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has been a very strong advocate on this matter.  There is a significant deficit but it will be mandatory for all higher education authorities to retain a certain percentage for research funding.  I can revert with the exact details of the number of women who will be involved.  We must first create awareness and then do something about it.  The Minister of State has been campaigning on that.<\/p><p> There was mention of third level funding and there is the question of how to future-proof universities and higher level education.  I attended an event last Thursday morning at the new Technological University of Ireland Grangegorman campus.  We brought all the stakeholders and leaders in the third level sector together and I specifically raised the matter of funding so they could make suggestions and see how we could look at the issue in a collaborative fashion.  There has been an increase in capital funding and there will be future increases in such funding.  Whether in Ireland, Edinburgh University in Scotland or any other university in the world, there is a constant debate on future third level funding.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, keeps me abreast of what is happening with the Cassells report, which is in Europe currently.  Whenever we are in a position to follow up on that, I will be happy to do so.<\/p><p> The reallocation of National Training Fund, NTF, resources that were used for employment programmes below the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, level 5 to the Exchequer was begun in budget 2018 and it has been accelerated in budget 2019.  There was &euro;57 million in investment in programmes with significant activity below level 5 on the NFQ that were previously resourced from the NTF but it will now be funded from the Exchequer.  The NTF should be deployed to support close to labour market skills programmes in areas of identified skill needs.  The support for enterprise higher education programmes increased from &euro;37 million in 2018 to &euro;120 million in 2019, and this investment will be made in areas with identified skills needs as outlined in the national skills bulletin and in line with priorities established by the National Skills Council.  As was the case in budget 2018, the NTF will fund all of some programmes as part of this investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#W02200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551195000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>With regard to Athena SWAN, there is reference to eight State-run institutions.

The allocation for each scheme is determined as part of the annual Estimates process.  The NTF is included as an annexe to the published Estimates of the Department and such funding has been included in the overall expenditure ceiling for the Department of Education and Skills since 2011.  This means that overall expenditure from the fund cannot be increased even where receipts increase, without a corresponding drop in Voted expenditure.  The surplus remains available for investment in education and training programmes to meet skill needs.  Prior to 2012, income from the National Training Fund levy had fallen from a high of &euro;413 million in 2008 to &euro;299 million.  However, since 2012, receipts from the NTF levy have increased annually due to improved employment levels.  The accumulated surplus in the fund has been critical in maintaining expenditure levels, particularly in the provision of training for the unemployed in a period when receipts were falling.  It is considered prudent to continue to maintain an adequate surplus in the fund to meet demand in future years and while the surplus represents a very significant sum, it would only cover seven months NTF expenditure at current levels.  The surplus remains available for investment in education and training programmes to meet skill needs.<\/p> <p>  I alluded earlier to the reform of the National Training Fund.

The Law Reform Commission is a statutory research and advisory body.  While our title says \"law reform\", we cannot actually do law reform as this is a matter for the committee members as legislators.  We are delighted that the committee has taken an interest in this particular report in the context of the committee's discussion on accountability in banking.  We are highly conscious that the committee has previously taken a great interest in the work of the commission, most recently in the detailed scrutiny it carried out on the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017 that was related to the previous work of the commission.  We thank the committee for the great interest it has already shown in our work.  We try to include draft Bills or schemes of Bills in our reports, which we hope the Government and the Oireachtas will find helpful.<\/p><p>We place great emphasis in our written opening statement - I will not go through all of it given the time constraints today - and take very seriously the consultative process of how we put together programmes of law reform, under which we carry out most of our work, and in the consultative process on the fourth programme of law reform, considering both the issue of the powers of financial and economic regulators and the related issue of corporate criminal liability.  Many of our consultees indicated that it was important to examine both of these areas.  We recognise that the committee is particularly focused on financial services and on the role of the Central Bank.<\/p><p> In the consultations that we held on the fourth programme, other regulators were also mentioned as being important as to the systemic risks to the State that might arise in the future.  Our report includes not just issues relating to the Central Bank and its powers, but also other sectoral regulators on which we note there have been a number of policy documents, including the 2013 document Regulating for a Better Future and the 2017 document on measures to improve Ireland's accountability on the issue of financial and economic regulation and white collar crime, as it is sometimes described.<\/p><p> We take consultation as a very important part of our work and receive a tremendous amount of input in that respect from Government offices, relevant interested parties and NGOs, in the analysis that we carry out.  That was certainly the case with this particular report, to include the context of the 2016 annual conference where we focused on this particular area.  We heard from a number of national and international speakers with expertise in both regulatory powers and in corporate criminal liability.<\/p><p> We recognise that in the choices we make in a report there are number of possible options in looking at many of the complex issues.  We are very conscious that this is a matter that must be moved on to the Government and the Oireachtas for final decision on whether to implement the recommendations of the commission.  <\/p><p> The banking crisis that emerged in 2008 and the activities of banks that led up to that was certainly a context and background to this report.  We are very conscious also that a number of studies have been done, notably by the banking inquiry that was carried out in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We looked at that in how we analysed the issues that needed to be addressed.<\/p><p> We are also very conscious of some of what the former Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan described as \"egregiously reckless risk-taking\".  We recognise that there were issues that needed to be identified in order to examine what further reforms might be needed.<\/p><p> We acknowledge that there have been quite a number of significant changes enacted since 2008 both at national level here in the Oireachtas and at EU level with the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We also note in our report a number of reforms that had previously been made, for example in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, had been used effectively in criminal prosecutions.  We do not propose or comment on particular cases or their outcomes but we note that in the report.<\/p><p> There are more than 200 recommendations. I am informed by our maths experts in the research team that there are, in fact, 202 recommendations but I will not go through all of them.  I will focus on a number of the key recommendations here.<\/p><p> On the proposal for a corporate crime agency,  we have looked at the extent to which financial and economic regulators have sufficient powers in their regulatory toolkit in order to make sufficient financial sanctions and make regulatory enforcement agreements or settlements.  We also looked at the issue of egregiously reckless risk-taking and what reforms might be done in the criminal law in that area.  We also looked at the role that deferred prosecution agreements, DPAs, or in effect the suspension of criminal prosecutions, play and the extent to which these DPAs might have a role to play in the overall context of ensuring accountability.<\/p><p> In considering the first of those proposals, that being, on a corporate crime agency, we are conscious that the Government's 2017 paper, entitled \"Measures to Enhance Ireland's Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework\", made a number of important recommendations, some of which are being acted on now.  One recommendation was on the establishment of a corporate enforcement authority as a replacement for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, as a separate entity rather than as a unit within the parent Department.  The LRC's proposal on a corporate crime agency is separate from that.  Our proposal would see a corporate crime agency with power to engage in prosecutions that did not fall within the remit of any of the regulators, be it the Central Bank, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, ComReg or the proposed corporate enforcement authority.  Under the relevant Bill, which is under pre-legislative scrutiny at the moment, the corporate enforcement authority would be limited to enforcement of the Companies Act 2014.  The LRC's proposal is that the corporate crime agency would have a wider remit.<\/p><p> We understand from the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny of the corporate enforcement authority Bill conducted this month by another committee that the review group on anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures is engaged in a review of our recommendation.  We also understand that the group is to make its own recommendations later this year.<\/p><p> The associated proposal in the LRC's report was that there ought to be a continuation of the dedicated unit on corporate crime that is already established in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It has dealt with prosecutions post 2008.  The LRC recommends that the unit work closely with the proposed corporate crime agency.  It is important that the committee be aware that the LRC recommended strongly in its report that, based on experience of poorly resourced agencies, the corporate crime agency and the dedicated unit in the DPP's office should be properly and fully resourced.  This matter is outside the remit of the LRC and we cannot carry out that kind of economic analysis of what sort of resources would be required, but we emphasised this recommendation in our report.<\/p><p> I will not go through all of the powers that would be found in a full toolkit of regulatory powers for financial and economic regulators, but of the six core ones mentioned in our submission, we speak in particular about the power to impose administrative financial sanctions and emphasise that, in order to ensure that it would meet constitutional requirements, it must be subject to court oversight and approval.  This would be similar to the Central Bank's current powers in terms of what can be imposed as a maximum sanction of &euro;10 million and-or 10% of turnover for companies and a maximum sanction of &euro;1 million for individuals.  In addition, all financial and economic regulators should have the power to enter into regulatory compliance agreements or settlements.  This would include the power to impose financial sanctions, put in place consumer redress schemes and agree to put in place corporate compliance policies.  The committee will be aware that the Central Bank already has these powers.  We make some recommendations on how we believe they could be improved, particularly in terms of the investigative process, but we also recommend that other regulators, such as the competition commission and ComReg, be given those powers as well.  We have made recommendations on the process by which inquiries are conducted by the Central Bank.  Their efficiency could be improved comparable to what has been put in place in the Medical Council's fitness to practise process.<\/p><p> Regarding the use of criminal law in this context, the former Governor of the Central Bank referred to the need to have in place appropriate criminal law enforcement mechanisms to deal with egregiously reckless risk taking.  The LRC examined two related aspects of this, namely, the extent to which the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 should be amended and whether there was a case to be made for the introduction of an offence specifically called \"reckless trading\".  The LRC came to the conclusion that it would be appropriate to amend the Act in order to provide that there should be an explicit reference to recklessness in that context.<\/p><p>That would mean, for example, in the context of the offence of false accounting under the 2001 Act, that it would occur not only where the accounts were fabricated knowingly and intentionally - the current law - but also where it was done with subjective recklessness, namely, where the defendant consciously disregarded a risk that the victim would be deceived by the false accounting.  On the 2001 Act, the commission concluded in its chapter dealing with reckless trading that it would not be appropriate to put in place an offence of reckless trading on the basis that it would either be an offence that would not be enforceable in practice or that it would have a potentially chilling effect on legitimate risk-taking.  <\/p><p> On the other aspect of powers to take a criminal prosecution, the commission examined whether a statutory deferred prosecution agreement, DPA, should be introduced.  This is a procedure whereby a prosecution can be suspended or put in abeyance by the prosecution, pending compliance and subject to compliance with strict conditions set out in the deferred prosecution agreement which would be a published document, rather than a private agreement.  The commission recommended that there was a case to be made for introducing deferred prosecution agreements, subject to the control of the Director of Public Prosecutions who would work closely with financial and economic regulators in determining whether a DPA was suitable in a particular case.  We recommended that the model that had been in place in the United Kingdom since 2013 under legislation which required court approval for any proposed DPA was the preferred model.  There is a DPA model in the United States, with which members will probably be familiar, but it is not on a statutory basis.  It is not subject to court approval and is at the discretion of a relevant prosecutor.  Therefore, the commission concluded that it would not be an appropriate model to use.<\/p><p> Another issue that arises in the context of criminal law in respect of corporate liability is due diligence.  The committee might be glad to know that this is the last of the main issues on which I will address it today.  The commission recommended that for most corporate offences of a regulatory type, it would be appropriate to have in place a due diligence defence.  For example, where an organisation has put in place suitable risk management procedures, this would be a defence.  If an organisation does not have in place suitable risk management policies and procedures, it would mean that there would be a conviction.  The purpose is for this approach to fit with the approach taken by a lot of the regulators to encourage organisations to put in place the resources required to have a sufficient risk management appetite, whether in the context of financial services or any other aspect of economic activity in which the corporate entity would be engaged.  The commission considered, taking account of all of the literature in this area, that it would be appropriate to have the defence in place for most of the regulatory type offences for which regulators had responsibility.  It would not be appropriate as a defence in the case of a fraud offence because it would involve either intentional or knowing behaviour or, if the commission's recommendations were to be implemented, reckless behaviour.  It would be illogical and inconsistent to say that if an organisation had policies and procedures in place to prevent it from doing something intentionally, it could be a defence.  We also recommend, in the context of organisations taking legal advice, that it could be taken into account but only in sentencing.  In other words, it would not be a defence in a prosecution.  <\/p><p> In the context of a related issue, sometimes referred to as officially induced error, the question is whether, if a regulator in the financial and economic area gave advice which seemed to indicate that everything was in compliance with the legislation, it would be a defence.  The commission was of the view that the matter would have to be dealt with on a case by case or factual basis.  If the facts of the case established that there was so-called officially induced error, in which instance it was reasonable to rely on the advice of a regulator, and that the advice had been authoritative and applied, it would either be a defence or prevent a prosecution from proceeding.  We note that the Supreme Court, in a decision last Thursday, appeared to indicate that such a defence would be available in an appropriate case, but in the particular circumstances of the case before it, it did not apply.<\/p><p> What we tried to do was in so far as we could take account of international best practice in the review of literature carried out by the research team on behalf of the commission in developing the report which was published last October.<\/p><p>The international literature from the OECD, the EU and those with expertise in this area indicates that administrative financial sanctions and the power to enter into regulatory settlements are key parts of a good regulatory toolkit.  While the commission suggests that the criminal law reforms which are proposed in the report do not in any sense guarantee that the issues which have arisen in the past can be prevented in the future, it recommends that they could provide an element of deterrence in terms of the risk-taking that has been referred to by the former Governor, Professor Honohan, in the past.  We recognise that it is up to the Government and the Oireachtas, including this committee, to determine whether all of these recommendations ought to be implemented.  On behalf of the commission, I welcome the committee's interest in this area.  My colleagues and I will be very happy to take any questions that members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551189600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their publication on this issue and their numerous other pieces of work.  Mr. Byrne mentioned the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017, which I have sponsored.  This simple Bill, which was drafted by the Law Reform Commission, only requires a number of tweaks so that it can be updated on foot of relevant legislation that has been passed since it was published.  I hope it will progress through the committee at a future point.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask Mr. Byrne about the commission's approach to some of the matters he has raised.  I have brought legislation on reckless lending before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission considers that an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, as opposed to the introduction of a stand-alone offence of reckless lending, would be sufficient.  Although I have listened to what Mr. Byrne has said, I do not understand the approach that is being taken.  I ask him to explain to me whether there needs to be a victim.  If the offence the commission is suggesting were to be introduced by means of an amendment to the theft and fraud Act, would there need to be a victim?  Can Mr. Byrne explain why the commission is not in favour of what has been done in Britain and Australia and what has been suggested by the former Governor of the Central Bank?  I refer to the proposal to make reckless lending in itself an offence, as opposed to making an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#L00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I can certainly start to answer the Deputy's question.  I am sure Mr. O'Malley will have something to say about this issue as well.  An amendment to the 2001 Act would not be necessary.  I referred in my opening statement to a victim.  The way in which the current offence is defined means it does not necessarily have to be the case that an actual loss needs to have occurred.  Deception does not necessarily have to involve a loss.  The potential for a loss is the relevant factor.  In particular, that might arise in the context of activities where it could not be established that there was a loss.  I was indicating in the context of the amendments that in cases of what might be defined as deception for these purposes, it would be sufficient to establish that there was a conscious disregard of the risk of causing a loss or creating a profit.  This would be sufficient to establish an defence.<\/p> <p>  The commission examined the provisions in the UK and Australia in detail.  We recognise that the former Governor, Professor Honohan, made a suggestion with regard to the UK offence of engaging in reckless activity that might cause a bank to fail.  It focuses specifically on a banking failure.  The commission examined that suggestion in detail.  I would like to comment on the detail of that offence.  It appears that there would be a very high burden on the prosecution to establish how it could be that a particular act or series of acts by senior managers within a bank actually caused that bank to fail.  The commission felt that this was a particularly high burden in the context of this particular offence.<\/p><p>It may very well be that that offence would be suitable, but in the analysis that the commission carried out, it felt that the burden on the prosecution would be quite a high one.  In relation to the Australian example, there certainly is an offence that describes itself as reckless trading but it would appear that in practice in Australia, insofar as that provision is used, it really is related to circumstances where there is intentional or knowing fraud.  Therefore, while it appears to address the question of reckless trading, in practice it appeared to the commission, insofar as we could see what was happening in Australia, to be related to intentional or knowing behaviour.  That is the reason, in a sense, that we came back to looking at the 2001 Act, which is quite wide in scope and, therefore, would address many issues, obviously in the banking context but also in wider contexts where one might not necessarily be talking about a banking failure.  That was the analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551189600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I will put it in the context of our past experience although we are dealing with future law which cannot be applied to the past, lest anyone think I am suggesting anything else.  The majority of the public believe that what happened in Anglo Irish Bank was reckless and there was reckless lending.  The layperson believes that and I certainly believe that.  I also understand that we do not have any law against reckless lending in itself so one cannot suggest it was a crime because there was no law against it.<\/p> <p>  Would the definition proposed by the Law Reform Commission in terms of conscious, objective recklessness be sufficient to ensure that individuals could be prosecuted if another institution engaged in a repeat of the activities evident in Anglo Irish Bank, for example?  That is the test I would put to any insertion of reckless lending into primary legislation.  Could we prosecute?  Could we jail the bankers in the future if they continue to do what they did in the past?  In my view, as I said to some of them, they should have been jailed for what they did, but it was not a crime and that is our fault.  That is the fault of the establishment, the people who did not pass laws to make those actions a crime.  We are now proposing to make such actions a crime.

The commission does not generally comment on individual cases but we have noted in the report that a number of situations did arise where prosecutions under the existing law, which requires intention or knowledge, led to convictions.  What we suggest, although it is very difficult to always predict exactly how a law will work out, is that it would be useful to include in the definition of what amounts to fraudulent activity the concept of subjective recklessness in the criminal law, namely, the mental element or <i>mens rea<\/i>of offences.  Therefore, while it is impossible to predict what exactly might happen in the future, the commission felt that it would be appropriate to include that concept of subjective recklessness.  The word &quot;reckless&quot; would by definition then be included in the mental element of the offence.  Mr. O'Malley will be better able to talk about the detail of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I agree with that, but one comment I would make is that when one analyses a lot of the cases that have come before the courts here and elsewhere - there has been a number of prosecutions over the years arising from the matter mentioned by Deputy Pearse Doherty - one of the problems is that it can be quite difficult to affix responsibility to individuals within organisations.  If responsibility is diffused, as by necessity it is in a very large organisation, whether it is a commercial or public one, it can be quite difficult to affix blame to anybody.<\/p><p>It is difficult even to affix sufficient suspicion to a person to justify a prosecution to begin with.  While there is no magic solution to this, the best way forward, as Mr. Byrne said, is to include recklessness as a sufficient mental element for the crime.  In other words, the law as it stands requires the prosecution to prove that a person acted intentionally, which means it was his or her specific purpose to bring about a specific result, or knowingly acted in the sense that he or she knew exactly what was being done and still intended to bring about the result.  If that were broadened out to include recklessness, a higher standard of care or level of responsibility would be imposed on people to ensure they did not take unjustified risks.  That is what recklessness is about.  It is about the taking of unjustified risks.  The word \"unjustified\" is very important in that context.  As Mr. Byrne pointed out in his opening statement, a major challenge we have to meet and which everyone must address in the context of corporate regulation is to strike an appropriate balance between encouraging enterprise and legitimate risk taking on the one hand and ensuring wrongdoing is outlawed on the other.  Hopefully, the concept of recklessness we recommend will strike an appropriate balance.  Certainly, it is well worth consideration on the part of the Legislature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551189600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Why make provision under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act which provides for offences with victims on the other side?

The Deputy is right to say there does not need to be a victim because deception offences are often so defined that a person commits an offence if he or she engages in certain conduct to make a gain for himself or herself or another or to cause loss to somebody.  Wrongfully seeking to make a gain for oneself, even if there is no identifiable victim, still comes within the definition of these particular offences.  The recklessness would be as to the nature of the conduct in which the person is engaging.  As to why it is not there already and the adequacy of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, the legislation dates from 2001 when it was based, as it happens, on a report of the Law Reform Commission from the 1990s.  It is unlikely that a collapse of the system of the kind which occurred in 2007 and 2008 was remotely contemplated at that time.  Therefore, the question is whether the offences in the Act are adequate to deal with this purpose.  We have made other proposals which must be taken into account also.

In this particular instance, the proposal the commission makes is that at all different levels of responsibility, there is a requirement that there be communication up and down.  The Central Bank's senior management proposal, for example, would identify particular roles and responsibilities.  The commission's proposal, which is related to so-called derivative liability or parasitic liability, provides that, regardless of whether one has an identified role and regardless of whether the Central Bank would impose a particular line of duty, if it can be shown that someone in a senior policy-making function in the organisation - whether he or she is called the chief executive officer, senior financial officer or corporate financial officer - has failed in his or her duties, he or she can be held personally accountable, as well as the corporate entity.

I appreciate that the recommendations that are being put forward by the Law Reform Commission add to our toolkit and strengthen our hand in relation to ensuring that criminal activity in institutions or at an individual level can be prosecuted, which will hopefully act as a deterrent.  That being said, I still believe the measures are quite weak.  I accept the witnesses have spoken about individual accountability but we are currently able to prosecute individuals who should have acted or taken notice or for whom alarm bells should have rung in relation to their specific functions within a financial institution.  I am only a layperson but the problem as I see it is that their activities are not illegal.  This goes back to the fact that if we had a banker before us, we could say he or she should not have done this or that but there is no sanction in the law for doing it.  There was nothing wrong with a banker going to a hotel down the road and giving a cheque to a developer for &euro;230 million without any proper scrutiny as to whether that was appropriate or if it would make the bank go bust.  We are told that despite &euro;1 billion having to be returned to individuals in the tracker scandal, there was really nothing wrong in it.  The problem with holding individuals to account is that if we continue to say that the practices that are happening or could potentially happen in the future are okay, what is the point?  If an individual accepts responsibility for something and says that it was his or her call, so what?  It can be described as an administrative error and every bank made the same administrative error but that is just coincidence.  I appreciate that this is a step forward but I am not convinced.  When I look at two of the major financial scandals we have had to endure in the past decade, namely, the collapse of some of the banks and the way in which lending operated, I am not convinced that the introduction of the measures outlined would result in more bankers being jailed as a result of their conduct.  Likewise, I do not know whether anybody would go to prison or would even be sacked.  Nobody has been sacked and a number of people have even been promoted within the banks following the tracker scandal.  I am not sure that this cuts it, but I appreciate that it gives extra teeth.  We are ten years on from the scandal.  While we have changed laws and increased regulation, that fact that we have still not dealt with individual accountability in financial institutions screams loudly about the establishment and how it is protecting institutions.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that, but I would like to hear the witnesses' response to see if they can convince me that I am wrong and that this report is the bee's knees.  If, God help us, we ever have to go through what we went through in the last decade at least there would be accountability because that is what this is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#P00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Malley would like to say a few words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Justice Mary Laffoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The Deputy has made a very eloquent point.  I am not saying this is the last word; perhaps other criminal offences could be thought of.  We must remember this gets down to a very basic policy question about the reach we wish to have in the criminal law, as opposed to other aspects of law.  One of the constraints under which the Oireachtas operates when it comes to defining new criminal offences is that under the Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights, every criminal offence must be clearly and specifically defined.  There is a right to fair labelling and fair warning so that a person can know in advance precisely what is permitted by law and precisely what is prohibited by law.  Therefore any criminal offence that is created must be sufficiently clearly defined so that a person can look it at advance and say, \"If I do this I am within the law; if I do that I am outside the law.\"  I am not suggesting that the kinds of issues the Deputy is raising could not be accommodated within a properly defined criminal offence; I am just saying that is one of the challenges that will always have to be addressed.  It is purely a matter of fairness as much as anything else.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the previous point, as opposed to the one the Deputy just mentioned, as a general policy for deterring criminal conduct on the part of people working in the financial sector, which is really what we want to do, the combination of the corporate offence and the personal liability that might attach to individual officers and so on should be quite effective.  I say should be quite effective in the sense that obviously the only penalty that can be imposed on a corporate entity, in effect, is a financial penalty, a fine, whereas of course if dealing with human defendants who are convicted of offences, clearly the penalties can be much more onerous through imprisonment and so forth.  One would hope that the combination of these two - that a company may be very severely punished with a financial penalty and that individuals within the company may find themselves suffering deprivation of liberty as well as deprivation of property - should be fairly effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1551189600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Justice Laffoy for her opening statement and for the work the Law Reform Commission is doing on the matter.

One could say there are different proportions when Ireland and Iceland are compared.  On the other hand, there have been a number of significant prosecutions and convictions.  In looking at this very wide-ranging issue, the commission recognised that there was the issue around corporate liability and personal liability of senior managers, and then also the kinds of tools that regulators in the financial and economic sector need in order to have effective preventive measures in place.<\/p><p>We also recognise that this is very much a complex jigsaw and that, as has been said before, since 2008 there have been quite a significant number of reforms in the financial services area and additional powers given to the Central Bank in order to monitor the extent to which activities now being carried out by banks are prohibited by law.  Going back to something like the situation that arose before 2008, it was quite clear from the analysis the commission carried out that there were two issues there.  One was that the regulator was operating under what was called a principles approach to regulation, which was in effect light-touch regulation.  Furthermore, the resources the Central Bank had were very limited in terms of being able even to use the powers it did have.  Those are certain matters regarding whether the system is effective, the resourcing of that system and the capacity to implement those powers in practice.<\/p><p> From that point of view, regarding the effectiveness of the reforms that have already been enacted and the proposals being made to fill the gaps in regulators' powers, I appreciate that many people were very unhappy about the length of time it has taken to address the tracker mortgage scandal, for example.  Equally, however, the Central Bank could not have put in place the examination it did put in place or the requirement to enter into a tracker mortgage redress scheme for consumers and to pay them back the money that had been taken from them if the Central Bank was just going into banks and telling them that morally, they should pay the money back.  The Central Bank had to be able to tell them that breaches of the legislation had occurred, that offences had potentially been committed and that if they did not pay the money back, other powers could be used.  In this context, those regulatory powers have been applied and put into place.  The question is the extent to which there should be individual accountability in terms of criminal prosecutions.  This is of course very important but we now have examples, which we never had in the past, of situations in which very senior people, including chief executive officers, have been prosecuted and convicted.  The cost of these prosecutions is very high.  By comparison, I think the international literature points to the role of the regulatory powers and the presence of a very clearly well-resourced financial regulator now in the Central Bank, including the proposals the Central Bank itself has made regarding the senior manager accountability offence that it proposed in its report last year.  Again, we do not address that in our report because the Central Bank had already made that proposal.  All those different elements of that jigsaw, including what we would see as the need to tidy up the issue of corporate and senior manager liability as a general principle, are very important from a preventative point of view.  They might not guarantee that the kind of collapse that occurred previously would not happen.  Regarding resourcing and the granting of effective powers, however, the literature the commission has looked at internationally shows that those kinds of powers, such as financial sanctions and the ability to require regulatory settlements to be entered into, are extremely important and quite effective and, from a citizen's point of view, possibly the most efficient methods of ensuring-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551189600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Really?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#R00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>-----that redress is actually given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1551189600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Mr. Byrne thinks financial sanctions are adequate to prevent this from happening again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#R00400","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>We are also saying that that is one part of the puzzle.

In its 2005 report the commission certainly recommended that this could be used.  To complement that, one would look at the kind of approach that was taken in the tracker mortgage instance where, in effect, one had the regulator imposing results for a very large group of people.  That might very well have been done through a class action.  I do not want to denigrate in any way a class action but these are very complex pieces of litigation to put together.  I would not say that class actions are not part of that overall measure but it was dealt with by the commission in a separate report.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide whether or not to implement that.  I am conscious there is a Private Members' Bill proposing that.  Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe that does not have that kind of collective redress mechanism.

In our work on this committee, we often come face to face with the failure of that law and we wonder why and how we can improve the law that we have.  The work of the commission is very important because it informs us and so on.  This exchange is the opportunity for us to test the layman's view of this against the commission and its view of the law.<\/p><p>Senator Paddy Burke raised a point regarding Jonathan Sugarman.  We can mention his name because it has been publicly aired here.  He abided by the law and said that he was obliged to tell the Central Bank, which he did.  Had he been listened to, we might have had a different outcome.  We cannot say that we would have, but we might have.  The biggest law that was broken was that approximately &euro;65 billion of taxpayers' money had to be put in to rescue the banks.  Arising from that, many people of the country were forced into poverty and legal exchanges with the banks to save their properties, which they thought they would never have to do.  We will not get specifically into Jonathan Sugarman's case but when we pursued the Central Bank about it, it said that, by law, it could not tell us what actually happened, if anything, to the complaint made by Jonathan Sugarman.  I would say one measure should be to take that law and change it.  The Central Bank should be allowed to name and shame in the context of the outcome of a complaint process against the bank.  That is the first thing and I think it is simple.  It is perhaps will not be so simple when the witnesses get at it but it is simple enough from a layman's perspective and gives transparency.<\/p><p>The law states that once the Garda has an investigation, this House cannot discuss the particulars of that investigation.  It may be an investigation about how public money was spent.<\/p><p>All an agency, a Government Department, the HSE or whatever has to do if it has been accused, and an investigation is undertaken here, is inform the Garda.  Once that is done, game over, we cannot pursue our work.  The law has to be changed in respect of giving the public information about issues relative to investigations or the investigations themselves.  There is a need to give some sort of comfort to the people involved that the investigations are ongoing, we know about them, we are conducting them and there will be an outcome.  One issue that was being dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts has gone on for 15 years.  We are told it is being investigated but I have no idea whether it is.  That is unfair.  They say it is because the law prevents them from telling people anything.  This all feeds into the public perception of the mainstays of the State such as the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the Garda.  It is creating a difficulty and respect is being damaged.  I am suggesting that these minor things might change it.<\/p><p> I refer also to accountants and their profession.  Their titles are displayed after their names and we can see if they are members of certain organisations.  This information is displayed to give them some standing and show they are okay.  It is the same with solicitors and barristers.  They are members of groups that give them a particular standing and give comfort to the client.  However, it sometimes happens that the legal representative and the accountant come together with a client, who relies solely on them, and go to the bank manager to ask for a loan, whereby they misrepresent the figures in order to attain the biggest loan possible.  The customer then complains to these organisations for barristers, solicitors or accountants and nothing ever happens.  A great number of farmers are now saying to us they wanted to get &euro;500,000 for a milking parlour or whatever and put forward the cost of a litre of milk at &euro;0.29, say.  The accountant told them that would not work and suggested that using a figure of &euro;0.35 or &euro;0.40 per litre might get them their &euro;500,000.  That is not a victimless crime; the victim is the client applying for the money.  I cannot understand why no one is held to account when that is exposed.  There must be a law somewhere that needs to be tightened or updated.<\/p><p> It is the same as what Deputy Pearse Doherty said about the tracker mortgages.  The banks must think we are all really naive to believe that on the same day in every bank, the decision was made about trackers and that it was just coincidence.  Whatever laws are controlling all of this have to be modernised in recognition of the fact that people are given an incentive to give out money, ignore real figures and be dishonest, knowing full well they will all get paid while the customer, who is the victim at the end of it, will have to carry the can.  Is there not a way of looking at all of these laws, not in isolation, in respect of how they impact on the perception of the general public?  We should examine how they can be tightened and modernised for our times.  A lot of what happened in the banking crisis is beginning to happen again and no one seems to mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#W00500","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The Chairman has asked us to address some very big questions there.

We consult on what it is possible to do within the limits of our resources and also in terms of what people who have made submissions to us suggest.  Turning to some of the Chairman's points, for instance on naming and shaming, in all of the recommendations we have made on things like the financial sanctions imposed by regulators, we are very clear in saying sanctions must involve a public statement of the detail, including naming the entity.  We are very conscious of the issue of transparency and publicity.  The range of powers we are proposing here need the oxygen of publicity.  We are absolutely committed to that in our recommendations.<\/p> <p>  We do not exclude from any of our work the possibility that we would identify work that needs to be done in addition to the recommendations we make.  Often, in consultations following publication of our initial consultative document, if an issue is raised that we have not identified in our initial document, we make those proposals.  On the regulation of those who are giving advice on debt and where people have fallen into debt, our report that was implemented in the Personal Insolvency Act of 2012 recommended that those who are giving advice on debt need to be regulated.  We are very clear.  There may well be deficiencies in regulation.  We are very conscious that in the lead-up to the banking crash there were issues around poor regulation and poor internal governance in banks.  They have already been identified, including in the banking inquiry.  We would not in any way be complacent about regulation.  I refer also to the proposal on deferred prosecution agreements.  In the United States, these can be done privately; in effect, a deal is done privately with a district attorney there.  We think that is unacceptable.  The only proposal we would make would be for such an agreement to be made openly in court, where all the terms and conditions have to be approved by a judge.  We certainly would fully approve of any provision that would involve the publication of whatever arrangements might be put in place. <\/p> <p>  In terms of issues around what can or cannot be said about pending investigations, as it happens, under the presidency of Ms Justice Laffoy, the commission is examining the issue of contempt of court and the scope of that law.  We certainly would understand a need for reform and recommendations in that area.  That is something on which the commission is currently conducting an inquiry.

We should not be afraid to go there.  I accept the separation of powers, but if we cannot exchange views between one another on how powers might be operated better for the people whom we represent, how can we make the law better?  I do not mean exchanging views in an open public forum where we challenge each other, but perhaps the Law Reform Commission is the body to consider how we should do our work or what laws need to be changed.  I would welcome it doing so.<\/p> <p>  My final point concerns those who regulate their own profession such as solicitors, barristers, accountants, the regulator of banks or any other regulator.  Regardless of what happened in 2008 and the resources and legal framework with which they had to work, it would not have cost the regulators one cent to put up their hands and say, \"Stop, there is something wrong here,\" but they did not do so.  As I have seen, nobody is penalised.  That is what is sad about the laws of the country.  Our constituents tell us that the law applies to them but that it does not apply to those on high, the elite, as they might describe them.  I would like to see a lot more done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Protected disclosures were mentioned.  The protected disclosure legislation is great, but is it not amazing that in most cases an individual whistleblower will tell us that he or she is sorry that he or she came forward.  The law has to be strengthened.  If we cannot learn from our mistakes, we will learn nothing.  I think all of that, to a degree, rests on the shoulders of the delegates.<\/p> <p>  Financial fines were mentioned.

I would like to hear their views on two issues.  There was an interesting discussion on the banks and banking licences.  We know that a licence can be revoked, but the reality is that some banks are too big to fail.  Therefore, the consequences of revoking a bank's licence in the morning would be calamitous for customers and everyone else.  I was interested in what Mr. Tom O'Malley had to say about penalties other than financial penalties.  In the United States there is a special prosecutor who investigates large-scale cases.  Is there a need to have here a special prosecutor or for a regime of that nature to deal with potential future financial scandals or white collar crime?  Should we focus on that issue?<\/p> <p>  The Chairman spoke about whistleblowers and referred to Jonathan Sugarman.  We have raised this issue on numerous occasions at this committee.  On the tracker mortgage scandal, it is a source of frustration that cases will probably end up in court.  Whatever about the procedures of the Central Bank of Ireland and the number of people who have received redress under its direction, I received figures yesterday which showed the cases of 1,200 people who had gone through the system were with the Ombudsman as they felt they had been failed by the regime the Central Bank had put together with individual banks.  I have no doubt that when the Ombudsman has completed the investigations, a number of the people mentioned will go to court.  We are familiar with cases in which Bank of Ireland employees were completely shafted by the bank which employed them and left high and dry by the regulator and the Central Bank.  A class action is important.<\/p><p>In terms of accountability, I have always been of the view that unless one gets whistleblowers from the financial institution, where somebody speaks up, it is very difficult to prosecute.  Has the Law Reform Commission considered, as part of the body of work it has done on whistleblowing, the whistleblower reward scheme that has been considered by Britain and is in place in America?  There have been some quite interesting results, particularly the high awards for whistleblowers who get paid a portion of the amount that is recovered by the financial institution.  Recently, a US whistleblower was awarded $30 million, which gives an idea of the amount recovered on that information.  Quite recently another whistleblower refused the $8.5 million that was awarded to that individual from the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and asked instead that the money would be given to the shareholders of the financial institutions.  It is not always the case that the incentive is the reason to do it, but in that case, the individual stated that while the incentive was one reasons for coming forward, that person believed the sanction was still too light.  I am sorry for going off on a tangent.  In the witnesses' view, is there a role for such a whistleblower reward scheme to be introduced in respect of financial criminality and inappropriate financial conduct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#Z00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Deputy Pearse Doherty's first question was about the special prosecutor.  We certainly discussed the question of the allocation of prosecution functions when we were drawing up the report.  In America, for example, they have the concept of the special prosecutor, usually however in a more political context, such as when a senior politician, including perhaps the President, is under investigation.  When it comes to white-collar and corporate crime, generally speaking they would not necessarily have special prosecutors but they do have prosecutors who are specialised in the field.  Let me give an example, a great deal of white-collar and corporate crime is prosecuted in the southern district of New York, because that is where many of the major financial districts are located and therefore, both the prosecutors and the judges who operate in that particular area have tremendous expertise in areas such as insider trading and areas that are very complicated and so forth.<\/p> <p>  One of the things we have to realise when considering translating that into this country, is that the real problem is not so much a question of prosecution, it is very often the question of investigation, in that the investigation of these offences takes time, as we saw with the banking cases, for example.  The enormous amount of documentation that will be assembled as a result of those investigations could run to millions of pages of documents and will take time either way.  Therefore what I would suggest - I think this is accepted fully by all the law enforcement agencies in this country - is that one needs specialisation in the field.  I think under the Constitution it is possible to have a prosecutor other than the Director of Public Prosecutions and Article 30 of the Constitution would provide for that.  Given the scale with which we are operating and given that the number of large-scale offences of this nature that must be prosecuted probably will be rather small - I hope I am not being too optimistic - I think it is far better to stay with the Director of Public Prosecutions because that office has an enormous amount of expertise right across the board.  What experience has shown is that while it is all very well sometimes to talk about appointing special prosecutors, it is a very specialised area in itself and one does need experienced people.  Therefore the better idea at present is to leave the prosecution of serious offences within the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is a specialised section within that office to deal with this area but it may need further resources as time goes by in order to deal with more of those offences. <\/p> <p>  In respect of the Deputy's second question, the idea of rewarding people for being whistleblowers, is not one we had thought about in the course of our deliberations.  It is obviously something, as members can appreciate, that must be treated with great care to ensure it does not give rise to other issues.<\/p><p>When one starts to give people big money for doing that kind of thing, the temptation to do wrong and to make false allegations and so on can be very strong.  I am talking off the top of my head in a personal capacity and certainly am not speaking on behalf of the commission but were there to be some reward, I would not have any moral objection to it.  I would, however, be anxious that the rewards would be kept modest and should not be at a level at which they would provide the temptation to engage in what might be false allegations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551189600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Perhaps the better step would be to protect the whistleblower to a far greater extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#BB00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551189600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1551189600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#BB00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551189600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 4.11 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
