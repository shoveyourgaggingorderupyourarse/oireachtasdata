Our work is entirely to provide the science to support policy decision-making both by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Animal Health Ireland in the area of animal health and welfare, as well as public health.  The centre is fully funded by the Department and is located in the veterinary school at University College Dublin.  I also chair the scientific committee of the European Food Safety Authority, where we do similar work in providing the science to support policy decision-making by the Commission.<\/p> <p>  I will glean key components from my presentation.  The programme is very much informed by ongoing research.  Our focus has been on two questions as to what the constraints to eradication are and what the practical solutions are to address those constraints.  We focus on the three areas of cattle, wildlife and the overall programme, including seeking to glean lessons from international experience.<\/p> <p>  On page 3 of the statement provided, there is a graph that compares the situation in Ireland with the four countries of the UK.  The green line shows there has been an ongoing fall in the incidence of TB in this country over time but certainly not to the point of eradication.<\/p> <p>  On page 4, one can see the fundamental question that I want to address today, which is whether we are doing enough to successfully eradicate TB from Ireland by 2030.  I am sure members will remember that 2030 is the target year that was set by the Department.  <\/p> <p>  Prior to the recent introduction of badger vaccination, it is my view, which is one that is widely shared, that we did not have the tools to eradicate TB.  It was very much a control programme that focused on how we could ensure TB remains at low levels while identifying and addressing the constraints to eradication.  Essentially, we did not have a full toolbox of what was required.<\/p> <p>  Badger vaccination is now in place and with ongoing roll-out, it certainly is an important addition.  It is my view, however, and there is very robust evidence to support this, that even with all current strategies plus the new badger vaccination programme, it will not be sufficient for us to achieve the eradication of TB by 2030.  There are three reasons for me to make this statement.  First, ongoing national research has identified a number of issues that are of ongoing concern.  Some of these are technical and some are not.  The non-technical ones include programme fatigue, the commercial realities of trying to keep commerce going while we seek to eradicate, as well as limited industry engagement.<\/p> <p>  The second piece of evidence comes from international experience.  Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the UK have had long-term TB eradication programmes, mainly in the presence of wildlife.  Other countries have had problems but these four countries have really serious problems and two of them have made substantial progress.  The last known case of TB to exist in Australia was in 2002 and that was in buffalo, and before that TB was found in cattle in 2000.  New Zealand is also making very substantial progress and I am more than happy to talk about that in greater detail.  Lessons learned from those two countries suggest that there are fundamental differences between key components of the programme here versus those countries that were successful and they particularly relate to cattle controls and industry engagement.<\/p> <p>  The third piece of evidence comes from work that has recently finished.  We have been working closely with Wageningen University in the Netherlands.  That work was undertaken to assess and answer the question of whether we can eradicate given current controls plus badger vaccination.  Central to this work is a concept with which members may not be familiar but which is important in terms of the argument that I want to put forward.  I refer to the concept of the reproduction ratio.  In terms of the way that diseases work, the reproduction ratio is the number of secondary cases for every primary, which means there is a threshold.  In other words, if we can get the reproduction ratio or \"R\" to be less than 1 then we can move towards eradication but if \"R\" is more than 1 then we cannot do so.  Therefore, for the threshold \"R\" must equal 1.  The work that is being done, as part of that study, looks solely at current controls without badger vaccination and it would suggest that as \"R\" sits between 1.07 and 1.16, essentially we are not eradicating.  When we add badger vaccination, we tip below the threshold but only just.  The estimate that we have got is \"R\" equals 0.93 to 0.97 or just below the threshold for eradication, and that is all current controls plus badger vaccination.<\/p><p>If we continued with the current controls plus badger vaccination, the fact that \"R\" is just below 1 means we are looking at an eradication time of between 60 and 90 years.  A couple of things suggest that the figure of just below 1 is a little bit optimistic.  First, it is based on national averages and we know that some parts of the country will be higher than others, which would mean we would not eradicate it in some parts while it would be easier in others.  As we shift from culling to vaccination we will, by default, end up with more badgers and a higher density of badgers makes it more challenging for a vaccine to work.<\/p><p> We are at a critical decision point, which was not the case one year ago, five years ago or ten years ago on account of the fact that badger vaccination was not on the table.  If we are genuinely interested in eradicating TB very quickly, say by 2030, we need to think hard about the scope and intensity of control measures.  This is important in terms of both time and the cumulative costs.<\/p><p> On page 8 of my presentation, figure 2 relates to a different programme, the programme for bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, but the message is the same.  It shows the number of persistently infected, PI, animals at different points in time.  In 2013 the BVD eradication programme started and if there had been no PI retention at all, we would have followed the green line and we would have had no BVD in the country now.  However, we followed the yellow line between 2013 and 2016 and, as members will see, it never gets to zero.  If that had continued, we would never have eradicated the disease.  We are mirroring the purple line.  There were issues of PR retention between 2013 and 2016 but it has progressively been addressed, though there were an extra three or four years of costs in the process of eradication.<\/p><p> I want to focus on the additional measures we should consider.  I am re-presenting the science from research done by our group and by many other groups and it is my view that there are three fundamental areas on which we need to focus.  One is to adequately address TB risk from wildlife and the badger vaccination programme is fundamental to this.  Most of the work involved in this is monitoring as we need to ensure it works.  If it does not work, we need to know why.  These are all active areas of research.<\/p><p> I am aware that deer are an important concern for this committee.  It is important to understand the epidemiological role of deer.  They get infected but we need to know if they get infected as a spillover host from infected cattle and badgers or if they are a maintenance host, where the disease self-sustains in deer populations.  Most worrying, we need to know if they are a maintenance host with a spill back to cattle, like badgers.  I have given examples from various programmes.  In some countries, deer act as a maintenance host, such as Spain.  The most interesting example, however, comes from Michigan, where white-tailed deer are a maintenance host for TB, although it was a man-made problem.  They acted as a spillover host, picking up the infection from cattle, but hunters in that state were leaving large dumps of silage and hay over winter to keep the deer numbers up to facilitate hunting in the spring.  This artificially increased the numbers and encouraged aggregation, which is why deer are now more than a spillover host in Michigan.<\/p><p> Data are sparse in Ireland.  The epidemiological role played by wild deer, particularly sika and sika crosses, is uncertain but we have some evidence.  The first piece of evidence is the expansion of the area, though we do not know about density and I understand work is currently being done on that.  In most parts of the country the percentage of infected deer is actually very low, though the numbers are much higher in Wicklow.  My assessment, which is shared by all the scientists with whom I work, is that in most parts of Ireland there is no evidence to support the view that deer are a maintenance host.  In Wicklow it is different and in the hotspots in that county we do not know whether they are a maintenance host.  Higher TB prevalence has been observed but this does not provide conclusive evidence that TB is self-sustaining in local deer populations, nor of the relative contribution compared to cattle and badgers, if it is self-sustaining.<\/p><p> My paper presents my thoughts on this matter.  I have spoken about this in great detail with a colleague in Michigan and with colleagues here.  There are possibilities but it is not easy.  In Michigan the methodologies are not directly translatable.  In areas of concern such as Wicklow, it is important that deer are managed so that they do not end up as a maintenance host.  Density and aggregation are things to look at in this context.  When deer are removed, it is important that their scientific value is maximised so that we can understand their role in this.<\/p><p> A new methodology has come on the scene in the past few years, known as whole genome sequencing, which seeks to understand what the genome is.  There is now an opportunity for us to understand the direction of spread.  Cattle and deer are infected but is it that cattle infect deer or the other way around?  Whole genome sequencing offers us that opportunity and that work is just starting here in the Republic.<\/p><p> The second important area is additional risk-based cattle controls, which the committee discussed in December.  In countries such as Ireland, it is not possible with the current technology to guarantee its herd is free.  A risk-based approach is used internationally so we identify a herd as low-risk or high risk.  Herds can be at risk for up to ten years but it depends on the risk factors that are involved.<\/p><p>There are two main drivers for this persistent risk, one is infection in the locality and the second is infection in the herd.  I wish to focus on the latter in particular, which is due to residual infection that is present in animals but not detected using current tests.  There are several studies showing that this is a significant problem.  Work that we have done, and work from Cambridge, based on modelling studies, would suggest that between 10% and 25% of herds at release still have infected animals present.  That was based on Great Britain, GB, data.  <\/p><p> We have not done similar work here but what we have done has shown that herds definitely are at increasing risk for an extended period.  We have been able to disentangle, not completely but to some extent, that residual infection is a very important part of that.  We have done work recently to create a picture of the level of movement of cattle in Ireland as part of ongoing commerce.  The data are instructive, indicating for example, that there were 1.3 million movements, or movement events in 2016.  This refers to trailers, not animals, a trailer could have one animal, ten or 100, and the distance travelled by those vehicles was enormous but that is beside the point.  There is ongoing \"churn\" or recycling of infection where we are not clearing all infection from herds at the point of derestriction.  We have substantial movement of cattle.  There are two issues connected with the fact that herds are being released and there are still infected cattle, one technical and one legislative.  Technically, we do not have the tools that will provide us with 100% guarantees of freedom.  Human doctors do not either.  Second, as the committee is aware, under the relevant legislation in the EU, Council Directive No. 64\/432, as soon as herds have had two clear tests they are free to trade.  That is not sufficient to mitigate risk.  By comparison with my home country, Australia, for herds to move from point of derestriction after infection takes eight years.  Here it takes four months.  That is a huge difference.  How do we reconcile that with ongoing commerce?  The only methodology available internationally to cope with the problem of residual infection and ongoing movement on the one hand, and on the other, ongoing commerce, which has to keep going, is the concept of a risk-based approach.  That is that herds move progressively from high risk to low risk with the opportunity over time for us to gain increasing confidence that they are free and that happens while there is ongoing testing.  The problem is that while we are doing that, we have to be careful not to put other herds at risk.  The approach that has been proposed and which I have spoken about for years, and I appreciate it was discussed in December, is the concept of the high-risk herds being treated very intensely to reduce risk and the concept of risk-based trading.  That is a process of allowing trade as much as possible while minimising the potential for high-risk herds to transfer infection to low.  That approach was the centrepiece of the Australian programme.  That is important because the whole country was under risk-based trading.  In New Zealand it is also a key component but there are very few infected herds there.  The process is that farmers of a particular risk sell cattle to herds of equivalent or higher risk and source from herds of equivalent or lower risk.  <\/p><p> It is fair to say in summary that TB is widely considered a Government problem in Ireland.  That is in fundamental contrast to international examples of success.  The UK struggles with very similar problems as ours but the problem is a lot worse there.  Australia and New Zealand, however, are the only other two countries in a similar situation and they have been very successful.  The story there of industry engagement was fundamentally different.  Industry representatives and government have been very involved in genuine and regular, open and honest engagement and building a trusting environment where real issues can be addressed together.  In New Zealand, I note  the programme is run by a non-government organisation.  As part of that industry engagement, which involves joint decision-making, cost-sharing has been a key component.  In my submission I highlight several models of cost-sharing that have been used and I highlight the TB stakeholder forum, a very important initiative here, seeking in part to make a bridge to genuine industry engagement.  I also highlight Animal Health Ireland, which seeks to do that in an Irish context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Simon More","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Professor More for a very informative presentation.

He has studied TB eradication in this country in great depth.  We want to be sure we do not eradicate the farmer while we are trying to cure the problem.  On the cost-sharing between Government and industry, farmers have been paying for TB testing for several years.  It is not an insignificant cost at farm level.  When farmers agreed to pay for the test, the breakdown was 50:50 with the Government - I am open to correction on that.  Before we agreed to pay for testing, there was a levy paid on all animals but we abandoned paying that and moved to paying for the tests.<\/p> <p>  The professor spoke about residual infection.  Is he questioning the testing undertaken here and its failure to find all reactors or is it impossible to have a test that can identify residual infection?  If the test is leaving residual infection that is a serious indictment of the testing regime.  Would the Professor expand a bit on that?  Is there a test that is better at identifying residual infection?  <\/p> <p>  Professor More mentioned the lack of information about deer.<\/p><p>There are figures which show that TB was present in up to 16% of cattle in some parts of Wicklow.  The reality is that farmers in some parts of Wicklow have stopped keeping bovines because they could not escape the disease.  <\/p><p> There is an inconsistency in what Professor More has said.  In most areas of Ireland there is no evidence to support the contention that deer act as a maintenance host for TB.  I cannot understand why deer in Wicklow are treated differently to deer in Tipperary or elsewhere.  In Tipperary, my county, there have been a few very bad outbreaks of TB over the past three years.  A large proportion of them have occurred adjacent to forestry.  I am most definitely convinced that deer are playing a part in this.  Whether cattle are infecting deer or deer are infecting cattle does not matter, in my opinion.  Deer are playing a part in the spread of the disease; they can pick it up from cattle and they have the ability to spread the disease over vast distances.  While the professor made reference to cattle movements, deer travel large distances across the countryside and any farmer near forestry who experiences trouble with TB will not be convinced that there is no link.<\/p><p> There was a focus on bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, and the failure to take out permanently infected, PI, animals.  It was suggested that such an approach was bordering on criminal, and I agree with that.  However, there was a lack of legislation when we started testing for BVD.  Keeping PIs in place should not have been tolerated.  Farmers are now counting the costs of that.  We were told that the programme would last for three years, and that if we partook in a voluntary year at the beginning we would only have to tolerate it for two years.  It has now been in place for six or seven years, and there is no end in sight.  It is adding a cost to every calf that is born, and the farmer is carrying that cost. <\/p><p> The focus of the presentation we heard was that we need greater risk-based cattle control.  That sent a shiver up my spine.  The Department will be putting extra controls on cattle movements, which undoubtedly will put extra costs on the system.  Again, the farmer will carry the can for that.  Departmental officials appeared before this committee on a previous occasion.  Professor More stated in his presentation that herds are at risk for ten years after a TB outbreak, and that the risk factor for those herds persists.  If that is the case, and a black mark is going to be placed against a herd that has had TB in the last ten years, there will be a huge impact on cattle trading.  Whether it is a calf, a weanling or a store, there will be a screen up in the mart stating that the herd the cow came from had cases of TB in the last six months or two years or whatever it is.  That will practically discriminate against herds and put some farmers at a huge financial disadvantage.  If that is the weapon we are going to try to use to eradicate TB, it will cause huge financial hardship and I cannot see how any farmer could agree to allow a system like that to operate.  <\/p><p> Returning to the first point I made, on residual infection, the professor is an expert and I do not doubt his expertise for a minute.  I have heard him speak in many different forums over the years but if farmers are doing a test with which we are not happy, as it is leaving reactors after it, we are not dealing with the hub of the issue.  Professor More is an expert.  He spoke about how Australia managed to eradicate TB, and given how much wildlife there is in that country, that was a very significant achievement.  Did Australia operate the skin and blood test, as we do here, or had it an additional weapon in its armoury which helped it?  Putting in extra controls for up to ten years on cattle movement and placing black marks against different herds does not seem practical to me.  Brucellosis was not mentioned in the presentation.  We eradicated that disease by very extensive testing using accurate tests.  I was a farm leader before coming into this House and remember strongly defending at a meeting at parliament the idea that post-movement testing be kept in place for another three years.  I said that it was essential, even though there were others at the table who did not agree.  Brucellosis was finally eradicated.  We were in that place a couple of years earlier, so we relaxed the testing regime and ended up back at square one.  We were confident, with brucellosis, that we had an accurate test and that we were making progress.  It was eradicated and we have even got to the stage where we have stopped testing for it in our herds now.  It was a major achievement.  If we had a test that left an element of residual infection afterwards, the idea that it might eradicate a disease baffles me.  The ten-year restriction on herds is not practical, in my view.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#G00300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Professor More for his very illuminating and learned paper.  A few months ago, in 2018, veterinary officials made their presentation, and I suggested that we would be talking about this in 2040 and 2045.  I was wrong; I will be long dead, as will many others.  We will still be going about this issue in 2060.  The professor might be familiar with the River Shannon.  People spoke about draining that river back in the 1950s, coincidentally at the same time the TB eradication programme commenced.  There is a better chance of the Shannon being drained than TB being eradicated.  We have already spent the guts of &euro;8 billion on this, and the Department indicated recently it would take another billion euro.  The Department is wrong.  Britain leaving the EU is going to cost &euro;12 billion.  We will far exceed that sum by the time this scheme is completed.  The reason is obvious.  The professor has identified it very clearly.  Other people have skirted around the issue but he did not.  The programme in place was merely a containment programme.  It was never supposed to eliminate the disease.  This vindicates a view I heard back in the 1970s, when I was at college.  The programme was never going to rid the system of TB.  On the vaccination of badgers, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must run off and get permission from the National Parks and Wildlife Service to vaccinate a certain number of them.  There is no widespread vaccination of badgers; it is very controlled.  Am I correct about that?  I thought I heard evidence from the Department on the last occasion that it could only carry out so many such vaccinations with the approval of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  That attempt to deal with the disease went down the drain.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill is correct.  The vaccine programme produced false positives and false negatives.  There were also residual cases where TB is not detected in the herd at all.  There is no chance this programme will eradicate it.  There was a better chance of winning the EuroMillions last week.  Ordinary people are looking at this and wondering why we are spending so much money.  Deputy Cahill has said that it has cost the farmers a great deal of money, but a great deal of State money has been spent on this as well.  <\/p> <p>  Can the professor tell us how Australia eradicated bovine TB?  The professor is from Australia, where there was last an outbreak in 2002.  It has a different system, but it also has very large amount of animals, along with possible vectors, carriers and hosts.  Are we sure that the potential carriers are the cattle themselves, along with badgers and deer?  Is that the extent of the potential carriers in our system, or is there something hidden that we perhaps do not know about?  I know about the concept of the reproduction ratio - I studied it once - but with the number of secondary cases, even with the vaccination, the ratio is barely below one.<\/p><p>I do not know where this will end.

Anything that comes from Europe is usually strangling legislation so I am very worried to hear Professor More say that.  Will he explain this risk-based approach system?  Is it a system where those in the higher risk category sell from one to the other and do those with lower risks sell to each other?  What way does that work?

Is the witness advocating that the only way to tackle this is to go straight in with a scheme or system modelled on the compulsory national BVD eradication programme?  Could a parallel be drawn with that which could produce an earlier result, so that I could see this eradicated before I die rather than when I am well gone?

The paper mentions the possum that was the main spreader of tuberculosis in New Zealand in particular, and a vaccination programme seemed to work very well.

It is a different animal and a different country or environment so how successful could it be in reality if we are to trap and vaccinate the numbers of badgers that would make a difference?  It would have to be done in other parts of the country at the same time and over a sustained period.  Has a study been done on the costs involved in trying to get that to happen?<\/p> <p>  Around my area we have much forestry and many deer.  When I was doing my research, I noted that the first time a badger was found to be infected with TB in Ireland was in 1974 and it took 20 years of study to determine that badgers were spreading the disease.  We are now looking at deer and in some cases it is and in some cases it is not.  It seems inconclusive.  I hope we will not have to wait 20 years to come to a conclusion in that respect.<\/p> <p>  In different parts of the country there seems to be different strains of TB.  If there are different strains, would it be one of the reasons this disease could be carried more by certain wildlife in some areas than others?  What research has been done into this?  The accuracy of testing, which has been mentioned, has always bothered me and many farmers around the country.  The TB test could be positive but when the affected animal goes to the factory, there may be no lesions and the reading is found to have been a false positive.  Nevertheless, the farmer's land is placed on lock-up, as it were, and he or she cannot sell animals or anything else.  Professor More seemed to indicate that in many cases there are cases where a positive result is not indicated despite the presence of TB.  In the countries where there were successful eradication programmes, is there a different or better method of testing?  Is there a more conclusive test?<\/p> <p>  There was mention of movement of cattle and two clear tests.  If there are two clear tests, a farmer may move cattle and begin to trade again.  The witness has pointed out the possibility of false positives as a danger and that there should be a longer period involved.  How much longer would that period be?  There was mention of ten years, which is more than the lifetime of most of the animals.  There must be something within reason so what kind of period would work?  The risk to trade and movement is interesting as there are some closed farm systems with bovine fare that are kept, finished and sent to the factory but they cannot leave the farm.  It is something I know that concerns farmers who are neighbours of those farms.  Wildlife does not know what is a closed system and it will cross these farms.  There are issues and we would like to get to the bottom of how suitable such systems are if we are serious about eradicating TB.  Deputy Penrose alluded to this but there are many people in the farming community who do not believe we are serious about eradicating TB in the country.  At this stage, we have had generations of people in the TB eradication industry.  Large amounts of money are being paid in what was a containment policy up to now that was sold as being an eradication policy.<\/p> <p>  There was mention of Australia and New Zealand as success stories.  What level of success can be seen in other European countries?  I know Britain has major problems but other parts of Europe may have a similar climate and a similar type of wildlife problem, so how successful have those countries been in eradicating the disease?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#J00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I hope I will be able to answer every question but if I do not, please let me know.  I thank Deputy Cahill for his questions.  I preface my responses to all these questions in terms of what I see my role as.  It is not just my role but it is the role of scientists, and we are trying to give our best understanding of the position.  I suggest my role is much easier than my policy colleagues, as that is what members of the committee would do.  We are just trying to clarify the facts.  I want to be very clear that I am not trying to suggest that the situation is hopeless.  Based on all the evidence I have put together and much work by much people, if we are to realistically shift towards eradication, we need to do much more.  We must be very focused for all the reasons I outlined.<\/p><p> To reply to Deputies Cahill and Kenny on the accuracy of the test, the tests being used here are really no different from those being used elsewhere.  The tools we use here are the tools available.  It is important to remember that the gamma test was invented in Australia at the very end of that country's programme but it never really used it.  However, it has been very helpful to us subsequently.  These are imperfect tests.  I will give an example, which I gave recently in a Johne's disease implementation group, IG, because we have the same problem there with tests, mainly of men.  If we get a prostate test done, we know that when we come out of that the result may be negative but that does not mean that we definitely do not have it.  It could be early.  There could be many reasons.  There are also big problems of false positives with the blood test used for prostate.  We are using these imperfect tests and TB is no different.  Mention was made previously of false positives and false negatives.  There are not many false positives but there are these false negatives.  Fundamentally, what we are trying to do is find a way forward despite the imperfect tests.  That is why, for example, we know that the skin test does not pick up all of the infection, and it is not very good at early infection.  The gamma test was introduced because it is much better at doing that, although it throws up false positives.<\/p><p> To be honest, the problem we face with TB is no different from most animal health or indeed human health issues where we are trying to do the best we can with tests that are imperfect.  That is the reason different countries have used this concept of risk-based trading, and I will come back to Deputy Penrose's issue in a moment, to provide some more detail.  Are there better tests or better weapons?  The answer is \"No\".  I do not believe we will get a better diagnostic test.  There is none that I am aware of on the horizon.  No test will ever be 100% effective.  It would be very rare for a test to be that effective.  We are, therefore, trying to use the other models to help us.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill spoke about the model of cost sharing and the fact that farmers pay 50%.  I do not dispute that.  What concerns me is that the methodology of cost sharing we use here creates resentment inasmuch as farmers, quite reasonably, do not want to pay that and they have no real say in where this programme is going. The percentage is important, and I have given some detail on that in the paper.  If I could use the New Zealand story as an example where an agreement was made about the percentage that would be covered.  There would be an envelope around all of the programme costs and industry will pay, say, 50%.  It is a little bit more; I think it is 56%.  It does not really matter.  However, in terms of every decision made, 50% of the input comes from farmers.  If they have a good year and the costs go down, the cost to farmers goes down too.  If they seriously need to ramp things up, the cost to farmers goes up.  Farmers are absolutely central to the entire process of decision making.  They know it is within their grasp that they can eradicate so they are willing to do that, whereas here it is fair to say there is no connect.  It is a point of huge resentment but farmers have no say.  It does not matter whether things are good, bad or indifferent, they will be charged the same amount.  That is the issue.<\/p><p> In terms of the question as to why deer in Wicklow are different, I am not sure I can answer that.  We work with biological systems and it is not always entirely clear.  However, based on international experience, we know that as we aggregate species and get increasing contact between deer and between deer and infected species and as we increase densities, those things are drivers for shifting from a spillover to a maintenance host.  We are working on first principles.  The fact that 16% are infected does not necessarily mean that they are driving the problem.  We do not know if that is the case.<\/p><p> Deputy Kenny noted that it took 20 years to clarify the role of badgers in TB.  The way it worked was that infection was found in badgers but that means absolutely nothing until we clarify the role badgers are playing.  Two large and very fine studies were done in the past 20 years, from the late 1980s.  In east Offaly and then the four-area project, badgers were removed from swathes of the country.  Essentially, they were comparing cattle plus badgers versus cattle only and they found that the level of TB fell significantly in areas of cattle only, indicating that the only explanation was that badgers were very much driving the problem.<\/p><p> With deer it is more difficult.  While it may be possible to remove all deer, it would be hugely resource intensive to do so.  We have an opportunity to use a completely different methodology now that has only emerged in the past couple of years, namely, whole genome sequencing.  That helps us to understand directionality and while it has only just been introduced, this methodology will help us.  I do not know whether it will help us to clarify quickly the epidemiological role of deer.  Ireland could benefit from discussion with colleagues in the United States in particular, who have sought to clarify the role of deer in their cities.  One of the beauties of science is that we work internationally all the time so we know those folks.  They were very helpful to me in developing this paper.<\/p><p> On the issue of extra controls, the sole context in which I am saying this is based on lessons from the bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, story on the graph.  It is important for us to be realistic.  It would be wrong of me to say that what we are doing is fine when I do not believe that is the case.  It is absolutely fine for control.  However, in terms of eradicating the disease, to reply to Deputy Penrose, we are close to a ratio of one post the badger vaccination.  That is over the whole of the country and not just defined areas.  The aim is to vaccinate over the whole of the country.  This modelling is based on a coverage of 40%, so 40% of badgers would be immune at any point in time.  If we could drive that coverage higher, that would drive this value lower.  However, we thought 40% was probably realistic given that badgers are being born all the time and they need to be vaccinated, etc.<\/p><p> Regarding brucellosis, I appreciate Deputy Cahill's comment that the test was much more accurate.  We had another great tool whereby if we got the brucellosis diagnosis wrong, we found out very quickly.  We do not have that with TB.  It could sit there.  I was involved in the final cases of TB in Australia and it was at that point that we could disentangle everything that was happening.  Currently in Ireland, everything is happening simultaneously and it is very difficult to disentangle what is going on.  However, in Australia, with the very final cases it was possible to show the importance of residual infection.  One of the final cases was what we call in Australia a clearance sale, which is a farm shutting down.  They distributed to 40 farms over two states and one could trace all of those cattle.  One could not do that here because there is so much happening in terms of TB.<\/p><p> Deputy Penrose asked if it is possible to eradicate TB.  There are international examples of success.  The story in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and other European countries, which I will come to in a moment, is that it is all different.  The problems in Australia were mainly with respect to cattle control.  They had two wildlife species that worried them.  One was feral buffalo, which were a maintenance host.  However, feral buffalo lived in a different area from feral cattle.  Nonetheless, they eradicated TB from feral buffalo by eradicating feral buffalo.<\/p><p> The other one was feral pigs.  There are 26 million feral pigs in Australia, a little more than the number of people, and TB was being found in feral pigs, which are just like wild boar here.<\/p><p>They quickly realised that feral pigs were eating infected cattle carcasses.  However, once those carcasses were dealt with under the programme, there was no maintenance of infection in feral pigs.  If there had been such maintenance, I do not think TB would have been eradicated.  In New Zealand, it is completely different.  It has almost eradicated TB from cattle but large areas of the country have very high population densities of brush-tailed possums, a feral Australian species.  Authorities in New Zealand are moving from trying to eradicate TB in cattle to trying to eradicate it in possums.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny asked about the experience in various European countries.  I appreciate the examples, which are important.  TB is re-emerging in Spain, France and Germany having been present at very low levels.  It is becoming increasingly problematic in Spain and particularly in France and is also beginning to re-emerge in the Alps in the very south of Germany.  It is primarily present in badgers and possibly deer in France, in deer in Germany, and in wild boar and various species of deer in Spain, although I suspect there is also cattle involvement in the latter country.  I know from our Spanish colleagues that the issue of cattle controls has become increasingly important there.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny's question on closed systems highlights a very reasonable concern, namely, whether a risk is posed to, for example, large feedlots from neighbouring herds.  A study by one of my colleagues, Mr. Jamie Madden, who is present in the Visitors Gallery, is beginning to address that issue.  That highlights that we work very closely with our policy colleagues to provide the science to help support policy decision making.  This issue has been identified as a concern and we will now seek to determine whether a risk is posed.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked for how long restrictions should be in place.  Ten years sounds like a long period for restrictions.  I am not sure I have a direct answer to the question.  The fundamental problem is that we need to be able to cope with trade while also coping with TB eradication.  Under risk-based trading as employed in Australia, it took eight years to get from the point of de-restriction to when a herd could be freely traded.  In the interim period, the cattle could be traded with many different herds, but that had to be very carefully done.  However, it might not be an appropriate system for Ireland.<\/p><p> Deputy Penrose asked how risk-based trading works.  In Australia, there were two layers of risk-based trading.  One layer was a state-based system.  It only took a few years to eradicate TB from the south of Australia.  Tasmania had a risk status, then Victoria, then South Australia and so on.  There was an area-based status.  One could not sell cattle from a herd in a high-risk state to a farmer in a less risky state.  There was state-based direction of movement.  There was also movement within states.  If one had been released from restriction four years previously and was, therefore, medium risk, one could buy from herds of equivalent or lower risk and sell to herds of equivalent or higher risk.  That was to ensure that any trade in stock did not set back the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Simon More","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>How did that affect farm sustainability from a commercial point of view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#L00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>That is a very important question.

It was a little akin to a cost-benefit analysis because there is a significant amount of effort involved in pre-movement testing.  We looked at whether it would be of assistance in picking up more breakdowns.  Our view at the time was that pre-movement testing would only be useful if implemented in a very targeted way, essentially focusing on high-risk herds.  That was the conclusion of our study.  I wish to make two broader points.  In terms of first principles, of course, it would be useful for animals moving from a high-risk herd to be tested at appropriate times.  Six months is probably an appropriate timeframe because it takes time for the infection to develop and return a positive test result.<\/p><p> I would like to digress slightly, if I may.  I have concerns that in Ireland we make a lot of animal-based decisions.  When we have an infected herd, we are essentially saying that if we do certain things, this group of animals is safe but that another group is not so safe.  I would have concerns that we are really stretching the ability of our tests to do that.  If we were to move to a risk-based situation, it is much safer to work at herd level and to say that all of the animals in the herd are of equivalent status whereas pre-movement testing looks at the individual animals.  Let us say an animal is infected.  The probability for picking up infection with a skin test is, on average, 50% but it will generally be higher later in the course and much less if it earlier in the course.  Everything helps but the fundamental question is whether we are doing enough.<\/p><p> On whether there are any other options apart from risk-based systems, to be honest, based on all of the evidence that I have, I cannot see how we can eradicate the disease within a reasonable timeframe without a really robust risk-based system, which would probably need to include trading, unless we get a better test.  On deer, the question was asked as to whether there is evidence anywhere of infection drifting from deer to cattle.  I spoke at length about this with my colleague from Michigan, Dr. Dan O'Brien, who has been extremely helpful.  He works for the wildlife department there and has been very involved in its TB eradication programme.  I asked the same question of him.  The authorities there are very confident that white-tailed deer in Michigan are a maintenance host which spill back to cattle.  They found evidence of TB in deer populations where there could not have been cattle involvement.  I do not think we would ever get that here in Ireland because deer and cattle coexist.  Our best hope is probably whole genome sequencing although the organism that causes TB is problematic.  In terms of whole genome sequencing, if an organism is passed from A to B, for example, the organism mutates as it shifts across.  If I know the direction of mutation, I will know it has moved in that direction.  Most organisms change quite frequently but the organism that causes TB might only change once every two years according to experts at UCD, Professor Stephen Gordon and Mr. Joe Crispell, who are leading this work.  That makes the work very difficult but nonetheless, as I have highlighted in my paper, there is work from New Zealand and just published work from the USA that would suggest that we are starting to get evidence about directionality that will help us.<\/p><p> Deputies asked how the disease is transferred.  It can probably be transferred in lots of different ways but the way that is most likely is through the sharing of aerosols.  In order for the organism to establish infection most effectively, it must be what is called a droplet nuclei, which is the way it is presented when an animal or person breathes out.  If an animal breathes out and if it has the infectious material, when a nearby animal breathes in, the infection is in a form that allows it to go all the way down to the lowest parts of the lung.  My expert colleagues believe that one might only need ten organisms to establish infection if it is presented that way whereas one might need 10,000 or 100,000 organisms for it to establish by way of ingestion.  It is really an issue of risk.  It is my understanding, based on best principles because we do not know everything about TB, that sharing pasture and other close contact, particularly when there is an opportunity to share aerosols, is probably the most effective way for the disease to spread.  We certainly cannot say, including for badgers, that sharing pasture or cattle grazing near a latrine is not possible but it is probably an issue of how frequently it occurs, the dose of the organism that is present and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Simon More","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Professor More for that.

I will need to revert with clarification, but I will offer my best understanding.  I believe it was first identified in deer in the 1970s, and it quickly became clear that it was in populations.  It was not necessarily at high levels - my understanding is that TB in white-tailed deer has never been at a high level - but there was no explanation other than it being self-sustaining in deer.  Once that was clear, the questions changed.  If we know that it is self-sustaining in deer, we can investigate whether there is evidence to support the view that a farm being close to deer is risky.  If that is the case, it provides some evidence of spill-back to cattle.  To be sure, though, I would like to seek clarification from our Michigan colleagues and revert through the clerk.<\/p> <p>  I will make a further point that might be useful.  It is a story that relates to the issue of industry engagement.  The Australian programme started in the 1970s and made rapid progress from the south heading north.  It got to the Kimberleys, country where not all of the cattle can be found.  In the north west, it is difficult country to muster.  The programme was run by what were called the \"Canberra bureaucrats\".  The scientists and bureaucrats in Canberra decided that, from that point forward, they would have to start depopulating properties.  The property owners in the north were incensed, and quite reasonably so.  The whole programme stopped.  For six months, there was no action at all.  Eventually, the federal agriculture Minister stepped in and said that, from that point forward, producers - farmers - in the industry would be involved and the decision-making board would comprise 50% farmers and 50% bureaucrats.  The latter were concerned and wondered whether the farmers would make the hard decisions.  A key turning point for Australia was when the Minister said that, from then on, if the board comprised 50% farmers, 50% of the costs would be shared by them as well, a subject that Deputy Cahill mentioned.  That was not the case previously.<\/p> <p>  What happened was interesting.  The programme fundamentally changed, becoming much more ruthless.  The farmers realised it was their money.  While they were much more compassionate towards their own, they realised that, if they were to rid the country of TB, they could not only make easy decisions.  They had to make the hard ones as well.  The same happened in New Zealand.  From that point forward, it became a genuine partnership between industry and the Government.  It was a fundamental turning point in 1984.  They eventually eradicated TB in cattle and buffalo in 2002.<\/p> <p>  This is not just a question of risk-based trading.  Rather, it is about the whole package.  We need to sit everyone down, collectively pay and collectively make decisions, which has not been the case to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Simon More"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>In Professor More's opinion, is Ireland being TB free by 2030 achievable or pie in the sky?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#N00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>It is a huge ask.

Private veterinary practitioners, PVPs, play a central role in Ireland's agrifood sector, our largest indigenous industry.  Veterinary practitioners are the gatekeepers of animal health and welfare in Ireland.  There are approximately 1,000 food animal veterinary practitioners providing services to the agrifood industry countrywide.  They do so under four key pillars: provision of services to animals in need of veterinary care; on-farm risk assessments and advisory services; animal welfare; and public health.<\/p> <p>  Every farmer has a relationship with a vet established over time and documented in the ER1 form.<\/p><p>A recent survey by Animal Health Ireland shows that 93% of farmers are very satisfied with the scientific advice and recommendations given to them by PVPs.<\/p><p> Vets are renowned as problem-solvers in the variety of on-farm situations that can occur.  PVPs have a proven track record in their ability to communicate with farmers, whether it involves passing on difficult messages or transferring knowledge.  The relationship between a farmer and his or her vet is based on a long-standing trust built over many interactions, both formal and informal.  The vet is in a unique position to understand farm management systems and local relationships, geographical and personal, that can have an impact on disease management success.  Livestock farmers value this resource which is available locally in every parish in Ireland.<\/p><p> Vets play a central role in veterinary public health and food safety.  Healthy animals provide quality safe food.  The vets' role in maintaining herd health on their clients' farms ensures Ireland&rsquo;s place as a leading exporter of high-quality safe food.  Vets are also the gatekeepers and stewards of antibiotic usage on farms and continue the drive towards relative reduction in use through herd health programmes, disease prevention advice, vaccination and knowledge transfer.  The 200% increase in vaccination use over the past decade, combined with a static usage of antimicrobials despite an expanding animal population, is an indicator of vets' role in disease prevention measures on farms resulting in better public health outcomes.<\/p><p> PVPs are a fundamental part of operating the eradication programme on Irish farms.  TB is a zoonotic disease capable of being transmitted from animals to humans, either directly or as a foodborne disease.  Members of many families in Ireland have historically suffered from TB, commonly known as consumption.  Thankfully, TB in humans in Ireland is now a relatively rare occurrence thanks to the major reduction in TB in cattle, among other measures.  In addition to the human health benefits of controlling TB in cattle, an eradication programme is also essential to facilitate trade.<\/p><p> Veterinary Ireland is a committed stakeholder on the TB stakeholder forum which is currently having discussions on disease control policy options to eradicate bovine TB by 2030.  Achieving officially brucellosis free status in 2009 was a major milestone and demonstrates what can be achieved when all stakeholders work together using sound scientific principles.  The veterinary profession facilitated this process through implementation of the animal health computer system, AHCS, on the ground in 2004.  Each herd test delivers an on-farm audit of bovine animal traceability.  This auditing service is provided to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine by PVPs without financial support.  The AHCS allows real-time tracing of high-risk animals, preventing further disease outbreaks in destination herds.  In addition, vets provide disease management and biosecurity advice to farmers on a regular basis.  This reduces the likelihood of disease outbreaks, including TB.<\/p><p> Approximately 600 members of the veterinary profession are employed on a part-time basis by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to provide meat inspection services to the agrifood industry, ensuring our meat can be exported to markets all over the world.  These temporary veterinary inspectors also provide surveillance for the TB programme and Beef HealthCheck.  Our members look forward to working with all stakeholders to continue the progress towards TB eradication and initiatives to achieve this goal in a timely manner.<\/p><p> Veterinary Ireland would like to take the opportunity to thank the joint committee for its interest in the significant changes made by the Veterinary Council of Ireland to the code of professional conduct for veterinary practitioners in December 2017 and the implications of these changes for the practice of veterinary medicine.  Veterinary Ireland highlighted its concerns on this issue in its submission to the joint committee dated 25 January 2018.  The effect of the changes made unilaterally by the outgoing Veterinary Council of Ireland was to effectively deregulate the ownership of veterinary practice and by extension the practice of veterinary medicine.  Veterinary Ireland would welcome the support of the joint committee in ensuring that we maintain the current high standards of veterinary practice and that lay corporate interests are not allowed to undermine this proven system for the delivery of veterinary services to farmers and the public.<\/p><p>This system has stood the test of time and is well regarded.  At present, veterinary practitioners provide a 24-7, 365-day-a-year service to all parts of Ireland.  Current practice is community-based, with an ongoing empathy with clients and their animals.  This service is provided by vets who are part of the fabric of the community.  Lay corporate ownership and control of veterinary practice would have profound implications for the future provision of veterinary services in Ireland.  These would include monopolisation by corporate bodies leading to a narrowing of competition, increased fees and a reduction in credit terms to the public, as well as insufficient out-of-hours cover in rural areas and significantly increased fees for provision of these services.  Vets employed by corporate bodies will be constrained to use only the drugs and services of vertically integrated corporate groups that own pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, referral hospitals and crematoria.  This can compromise vets' professional discretion.  Vets will be required to work to protocols established by corporate bodies to maximise returns.  Investigation and treatment regimes will be dictated by management to maximise profit.  This can compromise ethical standards.<\/p><p> The veterinary profession in Ireland has a largely unblemished record in the provision of a first-class veterinary service to the Irish public.  It also underpins a world-renowned agrifood export industry worth more than &euro;13 billion annually, based on high standards of animal health, welfare and food safety.  This successful formula should not be endangered by the radical changes that will come about should lay corporate ownership and control of veterinary practice be permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation.  We have had a very detailed discussion on TB.  I do not have much else to say on the matter.  I see that there is a control programme for Johne's disease.  I have serious concerns about this control programme.  I refer to the tests we talked about earlier and the practice of leaving reactor animals on farms.  I have no confidence in our current test for Johne's disease.  I accept that putting a code of practice in place at farm level can greatly reduce the level of the disease.  In order to control the number of animals affected, however, we had better gauge the level present in a herd.  The test does not stand up to scrutiny at all.  I refer also to the number of false positive results.  The accuracy of the testing for Johne's disease is a serious issue.  We have to get serious about reducing the level.  I accept that the code of practice at farm level can improve the situation.<\/p> <p>  The ownership of veterinary practices is a subject we have covered on a number of occasions here.  It has been 12 months since we discussed it.  I would like the witnesses' views the current situation regarding corporate ownership.  Have practices been bought by corporate entities?  I fully agree with the bullet points Mr. Murphy has outlined.  Corporate ownership definitely will not improve services in the less viable areas.  There will definitely be cherry-picking of the most profitable practices.  Where does this stand at the moment?  At the time, many questions were asked at this committee about whether it is legally possible for veterinary practices to go into corporate ownership.  How has this progressed?  Does Veterinary Ireland have comments or suggestions on what could be done?  The topic that jumps out from Mr. Murphy's presentation is corporate ownership.  We have discussed this at length on three or four occasions and I would like an update on it.<\/p> <p>  Animal Health Ireland has definitely provided a forum for focusing on different diseases.  I am repeating myself, but the BVD eradication programme definitely left farmers with a sour taste due to the time it is taking to get rid of a disease whose elimination should have been fairly straightforward.  I accept that the soft options taken have definitely added to the length of this eradication.  If we are going to get serious about diseases, we cannot allow reactor animals to stay on farms when they are clearly identified.  That practice was absolutely ridiculous.  The point on somatic cell count is well made.  We have made huge progress on it.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I would like to raise is the use of intramammary antibiotics on farms.  There is a lot of talk of severely restricting this in the future.  I would like our guests' views.  Is our animal health sufficiently advanced where mastitis is concerned that we can afford to reduce use of intramammary antibiotics or even eliminate it?  Would that have a spillover effect on somatic cell count?  It has been a tool that farmers have used for generations at this stage and it has worked extremely well.  There is definitely a consumer reaction to the use of antibiotics at farm level.  What would be the impact of restricting usage of intramammary antibiotics on dairy farms?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#O00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation.  I wish to ask about the TB eradication programme.  The questions are somewhat similar but from a slightly different perspective, given that the witnesses are very much the foot soldiers on the ground in regard to TB eradication.  One issue concerns the average length of time for a reactor to be removed from a farm, which is about four weeks.  That seems to be quite a long time.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses in respect of that.<\/p> <p>  What is their view on vaccinations?  Do they believe the vaccination of wildlife will work?  How will it work?  Is it a doable or sensible programme that can be applied in a uniform fashion across the country?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made in the presentation to the significant level of work done by veterinary practitioners in rural areas and for the farming community in general.  That must be acknowledged.  I remember Pat Gallagher in Mohill and Tim Mulligan in Arva and others who were characters in their own right in rural areas.  They were people on whom there was a dependence in rural areas in difficult times and while they have been replaced by more modern veterinary practices, there is still a sense that people are dependent on their vet.  If anything goes wrong on the farm, one lifts the phone and rings the vet and he or she is there.  There is no messing.<\/p> <p>  A neighbour of mine said recently that he brought his dog to the vet and the dog got more tests done in half an hour than one would hope to get in three years in a hospital due to the waiting times.  That type of service must be acknowledged.  I share the fears outlined by the witnesses about the corporatisation of the service.  We see that in other sectors also, for example, in the pharmacy sector.  Boots and other chains of chemist shops have come into the market.  I do not think that would be a positive development for the agricultural community.  It would be very negative if the sector were to go down that route.  I support the call made by the witnesses to ensure it does not happen.  It is essential that we would maintain the type of relationship people in rural areas have with their veterinary practices.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to veterinary work in factories and various other locations around the country.  How do vets get those contracts?  How does the system work?  I have heard some annoyance from vets that they do not get as much work in factories as was the case previously.  They feel that it is boxed off for some but not for everyone.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on how the system works in the various factories.  Some younger vets might like to get a share of it but they do not seem to get it.  Why is that?  I would welcome if the witnesses could shed some light on that.<\/p> <p>  Going back to TB, I seek the views of the witnesses on the herds that are in the closed systems, where it is known they have TB and yet they are left there to be finished or brought to the factory without being traded outside of that.  I would also like to get the views of the witnesses on the accuracy of the testing.  More and more farmers are pointing to deer as a factor in the spread of TB.  If animals go down in a test, the reactors are taken away and a couple of months later everything is okay but there are still deer in the vicinity that are not taken away.  Are they maintaining the infection and spreading it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#P00100","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from Veterinary Ireland here today.  I thank the witnesses for taking the time to come before us and for their presentation.  I am interested in their perspective on Professor More's commentary and any thoughts they might have on it in terms of the efficacy of the current eradication programme and the risk-based approach which he believes is required.  He suggests it was the primary reason for the success in Australia and New Zealand.  Such an approach would give rise to grave concern.  The movement element of it would give rise to great concern among the farming community.  I put a question to Professor More on the 30-day pre-movement test.  What are the views of the witnesses on the benefits or otherwise of that?<\/p> <p>  Last year we discussed the ownership of veterinary practices and the deregulation of ownership.  I would welcome an update on the experience in the past year of how that is unfolding.  We discussed Veterinary Ireland's concerns in that regard, which are well grounded.  This is an issue in which the committee has taken an interest.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made in the presentation to the fact that approximately 600 members of the veterinary profession are employed by the Department on a part-time basis in the inspection services for meat exports.  In recent days the Department has issued a call for private veterinary inspectors to indicate their interest in carrying out inspection roles at airports and ports in the event of a hard Brexit.  Has the Department had any consultation with Veterinary Ireland in advance of making that call?  Last summer the Department had indicated its intention to employ 300 veterinary inspectors within the Department to meet its requirements and be prepared for a hard Brexit.  It later downgraded the number to 116 veterinary inspectors.  As far as I understand, currently, the Department has no contingency in place in terms of in-house staff.  I would be interested in the perspective of the witnesses in terms of the demands on veterinary practices.  It is already a stretched profession.  Do the witnesses feel there is sufficient capacity within the private sector?  In the next week or two we hope that Brexit will, at a minimum, be delayed but in the event of a hard Brexit, do they believe there is capacity to meet the Department's recent call for tenders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#P00200","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the contribution the witnesses make to the local rural economy from an agricultural point of view.  I have a follow-on question based on what Deputy McConalogue said about the call for vets to become part of the Border surveillance system in the event of Brexit.  What are the implications of Brexit from a TB testing point of view?  Vets are contracted to do TB testing for farmers at specific times of the year.  A time is set out and nearly every farmer knows at this stage when he will have a TB test.  What effect will it have on TB if vets leave their practice and become involved in the inspection control work?<\/p> <p>  We heard much commentary from Professor More, and we dealt with the matter before Christmas as well.  What percentage of a vet's time is spent on TB testing?  Is the figure available?  In some cases a vet could spend a full day or a half day on a farm.  The job of a vet is a busy one anyway.  I noticed smiles on the faces of some when I asked a question previously about the target of TB-free status being achieved by 2030.

I will respond in the order in which the questions were asked.  In response to Deputy Martin Kenny, the average length on farm is four weeks.<\/p><p>My understanding is that this is because of valuation.  If there is more than one reactor, the farmer has the right to have it live-valued by an independent valuer and has the right of appeal.  That accounts for some of the time.  Deputy Cahill might be able to account for some of the other delays.  The Department can appeal the valuation as well.  When the test has been read within the 72-hour period, we have between 48 and 72 hours in which to upload it onto the system.  If we stray outside that timeframe, which is in our contract, it goes down as a black mark against us and we have increased inspection levels as a result.<\/p><p> Deputy Kenny asked whether the vaccination of badgers would work.  The studies we have seen are based on research done in Ireland by Professor More and others, led by the Department and UCD.  Those studies suggest that vaccination is as good as culling.  That is why it is intended to use it instead of culling.  Obviously, we have not conducted any research of our own.  We have to look at the peer-reviewed science and use it as a guide when determining what is scientifically correct.<\/p><p> A question was also asked about the issue of feed lots.  As some farms have restricted status, they do not need to have multiple tests if they have reactors.  Such farms generally finish a lot of cattle indoors.  They might have grazing.  It is my understanding that they are not allowed to have breeding herds.  They must have biosecure fencing, which means electric fencing that is 3 m from the boundary.<\/p><p> The observation that wildlife does not respect boundaries is a valid one.  We have not seen any research with regard to neighbours.  We are not aware of any such research.  I think Professor More mentioned that such research is just starting.<\/p><p> Deputy Kenny also asked about the accuracy of the testing.  As Professor More has said, no test is 100% accurate.  Tests are basically judged on sensitivity, which is the ability to pick up infected animals, and on specificity, which is the ability not to take out false positives.  The skin test, which is used worldwide, is highly specific.  Approximately two animals per 1,000 are false positives.  In other words, they show up as reactors but do not have TB.  That is quite important.  Depending on the studies one reads, sensitivity can vary from below 50% to up to 90%.  I think those variations account for animals at different stages of the disease.  As Professor More mentioned earlier, it is not as good very early in the infected stage as it is when an animal is heavily infected.  As the disease progresses in an animal, it gets clinical TB and might end up getting thin.  When its immune system is affected by the disease, it does not have the same ability to respond.  The reactor lump that one sees on an animal's neck is an immune response.  When the animal's immune system is reduced, the ability of the test is affected.  Of course there are other factors that depend on individual cows and on the level of infection.  There are other disease states that might affect immunity.<\/p><p> While the test is quite good, it is limited when it comes to individual animals because its effectiveness drops to approximately 70%.  There is a difference between finding an infected herd and finding an infected animal.  If there is TB in an average herd of 70 cattle, it can be identified that the herd is infected but it might not be possible to identify all the animals within the herd that are infected.  Animal testing varies between individual animal testing and herd testing.  The animal screen that we do is a herd test.  It looks primarily at identifying which herds are infected.  The Department then comes in with the interferon gamma testing to try to identify more individuals within the herd that are infected.  The interferon gamma test, which is a blood test, has a higher level of sensitivity.  This means it will find more infected animals within the herd, but it has lower specificity, which means there can be a false positive rate of up to 10%.  As a screening test, it will take out many more false positives than the skin test.<\/p><p> People think the factory test is the definitive one, but in fact it is approximately 33% sensitive only.  It takes time for an animal that has been infected to develop a lesion that is visible to the naked eye at a glance.  We are not talking about testing the glands; we are talking about a vet cutting the glands and seeing whether there is an actual lesion there.  That is actually the least sensitive test.  Some of the false positives mentioned during Professor More's presentation can be attributed to the fact that it is too early in the lifetime of the disease for a lesion to have formed, or the lesion is too small to be seen with the naked eye.<\/p><p> Deputy McConalogue asked about the efficacy of the current programme.  As Mr. Murphy has outlined, there was a significant human health element in the TB programme when it started because of the levels of TB in the human population.  Those levels reduced rapidly in the early years of the TB programme, which was long before my time.  The programme then became as much about trade as anything else.  When we joined the EU, we signed up to guidelines providing that we must have a certain level of TB control to trade with our European partners.  Third countries have their own TB testing requirements.<\/p><p> As Professor More has rightly said, the notion of eradication does not become possible until the reproductive ratio goes below one.  Vets have known for many years that is very difficult to get the reproductive ratio below one because of various external factors like cattle movements, fragmentation of farms, herd mixing and the presence of deer and other wildlife.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Geraghty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Mr. Geraghty has said that we need to get the reproductive ratio below 1.

Basically, it is an epidemiological matter.<\/p> <p>  We have a very good control programme at the moment.  When the animal health computer system was introduced in 2004, it gave the Department full traceability of all animals and allowed for much faster tracing of animals that were sold from an infected herd.  If such animals can be traced forward, they can be tested before they get a chance to spread disease in a herd.  This also allows back-tracing for lesions, etc., to take place.  It all ties in with the aim of the tagging.  The animal health computer system is the glue that binds it all together.  As part of each herd test, we actively manage and fix any discrepancies on the system.  It is part of our contract to fix these discrepancies or account for discrepancies on the system in real time, before the test is reported within 72 hours.  That has allowed us to bring our level down.  The fairly significant progress that was made between 2004 and 2014 has allowed us to talk about eradication now.  It is unfortunate that the programme all those years ago was called an eradication programme, because we did not really have the ability to put in place an eradication programme until we reached the level we are at now.<\/p> <p>  We have been asked whether the current programme is capable of eradicating TB.  I concur with Professor More that if we continue to do everything we are doing at the moment, we will eradicate it.  However, the science indicates to us that it will probably be 2060 or 2070 before that happens.  It is a question of whether the programme should be ramped up in order to achieve eradication more quickly and, if so, what the ramifications of that would be.  As vets, we are primarily scientists, so it makes perfect sense to us to ramp up the programme to try to get rid of a disease more quickly.  When we speak to other stakeholders around the table, however, we realise that there is a cost-benefit element to this.  It is a question of who will meet the cost of imposing severe restrictions on certain farms.  Will those farmers be compensated?  The representative bodies will have their say on that.  I sit on the TB forum on behalf of Veterinary Ireland.  When these issues have been discussed at that forum, proposals such as risk-based trading and herd classification have been severely resisted by farm organisations in general because there is no clear path setting out how farmers will be compensated for the immediate losses they will suffer if such restrictions are introduced.<\/p><p>It makes sense for us to try to contain disease where it is and then to eradicate it.  It would have to work better in practice before bringing it from a reproductive rate of 1.16 to just under one.  We have not seen the cost-benefit analysis yet.  An independent study is being commissioned by a forum to see about cost-sharing and such.<\/p><p> The Deputy's second point was about the risk-based approach, which makes sense.  On the difference in testing animals and testing herds, once a herd is infected, rather than leaving animals in a herd undetected because the test is imperfect, it is important to realise that the herd is infected.  It is then de-restricted but it is still higher risk.  If we treat it on a herd basis then we have a better chance to take necessary steps, especially with herds with chronic TB, and to do something for biosecurity.  The recommendations from the forum include biosecurity advice for farmers for those herds and the use of the pre-movement tests, which would help in those isolated cases of herds with chronic TB or which have been recently infected, to try to prevent the spread of TB from those herds into the 97% of herds that do not have TB.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about the time spent testing for TB.  We are talking about average figures here.  Some 7 million tests are done in Ireland on approximately 1,000 batches of 7,000 cattle per annum.  There are approximately 100,000 herds, which is approximately 100 herds per veterinarian.  That is two herds of 70 per week per vet  working in cattle practice.  I know that individual vets do much more than that while other vets do less than that.  It was a central part of veterinary practice for a long time.  Veterinary practices over the past two decades have diversified and expanded into companion animals, retail sales, herd health advice and some vets do factory work.  It is of relatively lesser importance to veterinary practice than it was but it is still important.  If one looks at costings in the Department papers, one third of veterinary jobs could be financially affected by that, which would reduce service.  The main issue that large animal practice has in Ireland with regard to TB testing is that it fills the quieter times of the year because we are a seasonal calving and lambing country, unlike our European colleagues with year-round systems.  We need many vets from now until 1 May and maybe again in November and December.  There is not a lot to do in the rest of the year, which is the main issue in Ireland, if there was not TB testing and temporary veterinary inspector work.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill asked about Johne's disease.  The sensitivity of the test and its ability to find positive animals is much lower than our TB skin test.  That is widely known.  It is quite high for false positives, at more than 90%.  When we are testing for Johne's disease, we are looking to find an infected herd over a period of five years rather than infected animals.  Once one has determined which herds are infected, one concentrates, through management, on reducing infection in those herds with the veterinary risk management and action plan.  In negative herds, one concentrates on trying to give best advice to prevent them from becoming infected by buying in the organism.  It is a difficult disease to manage once it is in.  In 2005, we estimated that approximately 18% of Irish herds were infected with Johne's disease.  From our initial figures from the pilot programme that Animal Health Ireland, AHI, did over the past five years, it is now 27%, so it is expanding.  The current programme is quite good at helping individual farmers with infected herds to contain it within their herds.  The problem we have with it as a programme is that we feel that there is a threshold above which it will be impossible to reduce the level of Johne's disease in Irish herds to a negligible amount over ten to 20 years.  Much of the increase from 18% to 27% can be accounted for by dairy expansion.  There was a lot of movement and trade.<\/p><p> We believe that now is the time to take the hard decision.  A study from Teagasc for AHI a couple of years ago determined that a programme that would work and deliver the action needed to reduce Johne's disease in the national herd would cost approximately &euro;13 million a year.  Unfortunately, less than &euro;1 million a year is allocated so while the programme we have is good for individual farms that are infected, we have concerns about the prevalence at a national level.  We support the programme because any reduction in Johne's disease is good but it may not reduce the national prevalence and may miss that threshold time opportunity that we have.  I will let others answer the other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Geraghty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I think Mr. Geraghty said that the test was approximately 70% accurate.

At present, four practices in Ireland have been purchased by two British corporate bodies, which have purchased two each.  There is strong anecdotal evidence that between 40 and 100 practices have been assessed and would be at what is called a pre-purchase stage.  The Veterinary Council issued a statement on ownership that anybody could own a practice.  It subsequently put that under review and then deleted it from the code of conduct pending further discussion.  We surveyed our members and found that approximately 86% of our members do not want lay incorporation involved in veterinary practices.  The proponents of lay corporate bodies being involved in practices made the case that young vets would benefit significantly from continuing professional development, better working conditions and better relations.  There was a debate in Mullingar and those young vets, who have their own Progressive Veterinary Network, voted by 86% that they did not want lay incorporation of veterinary practices.  The Veterinary Council is resurveying our surveys.  It has also belatedly consulted with other stakeholders.<\/p><p>The general gist is roughly 80% to 85% by all parties who voted to reject any proposals for lay incorporation.<\/p><p> I did their survey yesterday.  It is being carried out by an independent company.  I was amazed at the structure of the questions they were asking.  The first significant question they asked was whether I was opposed to corporate ownership of veterinary practices.  I did not really know how to answer it, so I said \"No\".  The next question they asked was, \"Why are you opposed to lay ownership-operation of veterinary practice?\"  It is a completely different question.  Ownership is one matter and ownership and operation is completely different.  While a case can be made that the legalities around ownership of veterinary practice are strong, our legal advice would be that one would have to put up a fairly ebullient case to convince anybody that one cannot own what one wants to own.  However, what is clear is that lay corporate bodies, under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, cannot operate veterinary practices.  They cannot prescribe drugs.  It would be doubtful if they could have any input into management.  They cannot, according to section 58, invoice, nor can a drug company supply drugs to a limited lay-corporate body.<\/p><p> Probably the main two points that would be made by the protagonists of lay incorporation are first, that young veterinaries would like it - that has been absolutely flattened; and the second would relate to the capacity of these vulture funds to invest large amounts of money in infrastructure and better conditions.  Those can be achieved within the present structure by ultimately giving corporate status to existing practices that are veterinarian owned.  If there is an ideal solution to emerge from all this when all has settled down, I would hope that we would have the sense for all the reasons we enumerated in our report some of which have been validated even recently - I am sure the committee will be aware of costings for night services and other matters in the new systems - to realise that the solution would be that veterinaries would be given an overdue incorporation status which is available to all others involved in services industries.  It would allow practices to be able to harvest some money - I am sure farmers would understand this - to invest in their practices and would be able to provide such services as MRI and CT scans and advanced equipment, which a corporate body, possibly, if it was going well, would be able to supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551139200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Deputy Jackie Cahill took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I do not understand some of the points Mr. Neary made.

There is an ethical obligation on us to do it and not to let any animal suffer, but there may be no financial reward for doing it.<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of how the factory shifts are distributed.  There was always an open panel system.  Every young veterinarian in the country, including myself when I was young, got on a panel.  It was an open system.  It was a good system.  Then, unilaterally, in 2012, the Department, as part of a public service embargo we would have to assume, decided that it was closing the panels.  Until such time as we reached agreement with the Department only two or three weeks ago, that embargo remained.  I would say the reopening of the panels will occur for young vets on an as-needed basis.  The reason for the as-needed basis rather than the open policy is the zero-hour legislation that will come in.  Anybody who went on the panel heretofore took his or her one shift a year or one shift a month and as vets left the panel, the others gradually moved up.  Some lads are 20th on a panel before they get a permanent shift.  The panels will be opened again but not to the extent where they are wide open because of zero hour legislation which would require that if they got no work, they would have to be paid some money.  The status on the panels, from 2012 to 2019, was as a result of that largely public service embargo.<\/p> <p>  I will just make a few comments from an age perspective on the TB scheme.  Sometimes we forget the progress that has been made.  Mr. Geraghty referred to it being a human problem.  I remember once early in life, an old man spoke to me in Kilbegnet, Creggs.  He said that people really do not understand the progress that had been made with the TB eradication - it probably never should have been called an \"eradication scheme\" - or TB testing scheme in that his job in the early 1950s, as he was one of the few in the parish who had a shotgun, was to go his neighbours' place to shoot the cows who were emaciated and coughing blood.  When we are talking about the eradication of TB, except for an odd carrier case, we have never seen TB as it existed in cattle where it was a debilitating disease of considerable economic significance where those animals were infecting other animals and where the milk was also infecting people.  We should always be careful.  As Deputy Cahill referred to with the brucellosis scheme, one does not forget where one came from.  At one stage, we had the brucellosis almost eradicated.  When we statistically reached official brucellosis free, OBF, status, we stopped testing.  It came at the same time as there was a massive influx of southern cattle into the west for new beef incentives and we absolutely blew brucellosis back out of the water again.<\/p> <p>  Progress has been made.  I would remind Deputy Cahill, only because he was talking about it, about the risk-based assessment.  To my recollection, towards the terminal stages of the brucellosis eradication scheme there was a risk-based assessment.  As I recall, when I started first anyway, one had a red card, a brown card and a green card for one's cow, depending on her brucellosis status.<\/p><p>Those with red cards could only go into red herds, amber cards could only go into amber or red herds and green cards could go into any herd.  Even at that stage of brucellosis, movement was allowed from cleaner herds back to lesser herds but not from high risk herds to lesser risk herds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I do not remember that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#T00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I remember it.  Deputy McConalogue asked my opinion of Professor More's suggestion.  With regard to TB and Johne's disease, risk-based assessments must play a bigger part when there are no specific deaths.  We must assess the risk of the herd infecting other animals rather than relying on specific tests to identify particular animals and stating the rest of the herd is fine.  A herd analysis of risk must be done.<\/p> <p>  The 30 day pre-movement test after six months was mentioned.  My understanding of the outcome of TB tests done way back is that in the first year of having TB, four reactors put with four ordinary cattle are unlikely to spread it but if they are left together for a second year the spread occurs.  In other words, that is when the breakdown happens in the reactors and they become spreaders.  With regard to yearly tests as opposed to tests every six months, if a farmer buys an animal on a specific day, which is almost a year since that animal had been tested, and that farmer's annual herd test is not until almost the same time the following year, it means that potentially an animal bought in could go two years without a test.  This is a huge risk as it will have gone into a second year without a test.   There would be merit to having a pre-movement test of high-risk animals.  It would be of benefit.<\/p> <p>  With regard to residual animals and the two years in which they can potentially spread TB, the single greatest godsend for the TB testing scheme was the farmer payment.  The farmer payment means a test is guaranteed every year.  I remember having entire years off in the early 1980s.  In a particular budgetary year either 20% or 40% of the high-risk herds would be tested and the remainder of the herds would be left untested for that year, and the following year perhaps 60% might be done but others went untested again.  There was no hope TB would be reduced, never mind eradicated, so long that residual TB was allowed to reinfect.  At least now, when we have a test every year, most TB will be picked up at a point before the animal's ability to spread it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to how we will manage inspections at ports, we were consulted briefly - no, in fact, we were told it was happening.

They could then do the very same thing except they would have qualified vets.  My point is Veterinary Ireland's real opposition is to mass ownership of veterinary practices by the big guys taking over and pushing out the small guys.  Is that where the witnesses are coming from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#T02400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>The problem we have is not ownership, it is the autonomy of veterinary practitioners to practise veterinary medicine free from encumbrances from clients, corporate bodies or lay people who may have an agenda that does not meet our ethics.  It really is as simple as this.  It is autonomy to practice veterinary medicine in an ethically and legally correct way.  Vets want to maintain this for themselves.  There was a recent case in Germany where a Dutch pharmaceutical company bought a Dutch pharmacy.  The German pharmaceutical council took a case to the European courts and within the past four or five months a ruling was made that each state, if it sees good reason for a stance it wishes to take on human health, animal health or professional ethics grounds is within its rights to protect those professions.  This is used.<\/p><p>Since the Veterinary Practice Act of the 1800s, legislation has always protected the practice of veterinary medicine from lay corporate bodies and lay persons.  It is not a question of who owns the practice; our legal advice is that it does not really matter.

Forever more they will be unmotivated employees of a big corporate.  I am retired from practice, but the demotivation to which this measure will give rise in the profession bothers me, as do the economic consequences.  A vet will be paid to do a job until 5 p.m. and work a set number of hours per week, but most vets work beyond 5 p.m. and do whatever they have to do at any given time.  It is their practice, business and client who is also their neighbour.  I have often been dressed to attend a family event such as Holy Communion and instead had to go to section a ewe, getting blood all over myself in the process, but one just has to do it.  I am sure there will not be the same motivation if this measure goes through.<\/p> <p>  I have been over and back to England and seen what has happened there in large animal practices.  It has gone from being local to regional.  In the drive towards incorporation most companies kept the small animal part of their businesses but got rid of the large animal part by either closing it down or selling it to a group of fellows who might operate within an 80-mile radius.  There are herd health programmes and three-hour guarantees to reach an emergency case, but it has done away with sheep practices altogether because the fees for lambing or sectioning a ewe during the night mean that such services cannot be justified.  Many now get rid of animals in distress, rather than bring them to a vet.  There are huge animal welfare issues related to this measure.<\/p> <p>  I worked in an area which was very heavily populated with sheep.  I had to get up at 3 a.m. to put a lamb's intestines back in for &euro;15.  That is what we do because we are vets.  There are point to point meetings, shows and other gatherings where a vet is required to be, free of charge.  It is a system, of which we are very proud.  Our medical colleagues have diverged into out-of-hours services, but I would not like to see us go down that route, or the English route, in veterinary practice.  Our system is town and village-based and on a continuous, 24\/7, 365 days per year basis. which we should protect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Neary"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Mr. Neary has referred to the place vets have as part of the community.

We welcome the meat factory work that has opened up recently and want to see young vets coming on board and being part of the fabric of the community, as they have been in the past.  Deputy Cahill referred to what might happen to somatic cell counts.  We cannot just take antibiotics away; we have to have an integrated management system, where a small group of vets work with a farmer and know what is happening on a farm.  They know what the farmer is like and what his or her family situation is.  These management structures make it possible to reduce the amounts of antibiotics being used on a farm by using intramammary injections instead.  It does not happen as a single event.  There is a complete picture which involves managing a cow and a farm to reduce the amounts of antibiotics used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending and their presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019022600002#U00500","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551139200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 6.45 p.m. until 5 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 March 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Select Committee on Education and Skills","time":1551139200,"counter":105},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Roghchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 15:30<\/p><p>The Select Committee met at 15:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Kathleen Funchion, Catherine Martin, Joe McHugh (Minister for Education and Skills), Tony McLoughlin, Hildegarde Naughton, Jan O'Sullivan.<\/p><p>Teachta \/ Deputy Thomas Byrne sa Chathaoir \/ in the Chair.<\/p>","time":1551139200,"counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Business of Select Committee","time":1551139200,"counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#A00100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>In the unavoidable absence of the Chairman, I must call for nominations for the election of a temporary Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Clerk to the Committee"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I nominate Deputy Thomas Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#B00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>As there are no other nominations, I call on Deputy Thomas Byrne to take the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Clerk to the Committee"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551139200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Deputy Thomas Byrne took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I propose that we go into private session to discuss the arrangements for the meeting.

Schools will receive a 5% increase in capitation with an increase of &euro;10 million in school funding over the 2019-20 school year.  This is the first increase in the standard rate of capitation since the period of reduction in capitation rates that took place from 2011 to 2015.  We will be investing in improving outcomes for children with additional care needs, with &euro;4.75 million allocated to commence the implementation of the comprehensive SNA review.  School leadership will be supported with additional release days for teaching principals and the allocation of administrative deputy principal posts in special schools.  The Department's capital budget will be at its highest ever level, at &euro;941 million, in 2019.  This is an increase of more than 26% on last year.  More than &euro;670 million will be invested in schools, including investment in ICT, and more than &euro;150 million will be invested in the tertiary education and training system.  The Department's allocation includes a package of nearly &euro;99 million in measures in the tertiary education system.  This includes nearly &euro;70 million in funding arising from an increase in the national training fund levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#C00300","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>It may be more useful if we proceeded programme by programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#D00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#D00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>We will stick to programme A, which relates to primary, secondary and early years education.

Are there other reasons for it?  Is there a focus on projects that are necessary but more expensive?  Does it relate to site costs in urban areas?  What are the reasons for the higher capital budget when the outturns do not seem to be appreciating at the same rate?

Will the Minister tell us how many students will be moved from prefabs to permanent accommodation in 2019 as a result of the capital budget?<\/p> <p>  The Minister's capital budget provides for extra funding for school laboratories and physical education, PE, halls.

In respect of the figures we were given, I understandably took a look at those which went down rather than up for 2019.  One of these is subhead A7, which relates to the salaries, wages and allowances of non-teaching staff in primary and post-primary schools.<\/p><p>There has been considerable concern about secretarial and caretaking staff, particularly those who are not paid directly by the Department.  Will the Minister clarify if they are included in this statistic or if there is a separate allocation on account of the fact that they are paid directly by the school?  They are in a much less advantageous position than others working in the same school.<\/p><p> There is a 2% reduction in the allocation for teacher education, which seems to be mostly continuing professional development, CPD, and related to the running of education centres.  Will the Minister explain why there is a reduction?  There is an increase of 15% under subhead A15 for primary and post-primary infrastructure.  As it includes temporary school premises, can the Minister say if there is still widespread use of prefabs and whether there has been a significant increase or decrease in the length of time students have to spend in prefabs while waiting for the provision of more long-term school buildings?  It is of concern to all of us that some children spend a large number of their school years in prefabs.  There is a policy to reduce the length of time they spend in prefabs, but how successful have we been in achieving this?  One needs prefabs when they are required for urgent use because the population in a given area is growing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#E01000","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Will the Minister increase capitation grants for schools in the next budget?

Our focus is on the capital programme for the period 2016 to 2019 which is for planned school projects, extensions and other construction works.  The Acting Chairman said there had been a reduction in the number of new school places throughout the country.  He is obviously aware of the pressures in his constituency.<\/p><p>Our guesstimates are made on a mathematical basis, using geographical information systems and in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the local authorities.  We try to identify where the pressure points will be.  My predecessor, Deputy Bruton, announced 42 new schools in places where we projected an increase in population.  When I was in Gorey two weeks ago, I met a number of primary school principals who were very anxious about the availability of secondary school places, not this year or next year but in three to five years' time.  There is an acute awareness of the pressure points in terms of where the next growth centres will be.  That is why it is important we keep all of our projections, estimates and data under constant review.<\/p><p> There was a point made about different standards and specifications.  In the past two or three years there has been increased emphasis on the environmental sustainability of buildings.  We are putting a stronger focus on ensuring the design of buildings is in keeping with environmental considerations.  Design teams now have to have such factors at the heart of their work.<\/p><p> On the use of prefabs, in 2018-19 there will be over 130 large-scale projects, or 38% of the 340 projects referred to, in addition to 280 smaller-scale projects and the additional accommodation scheme.  They will deliver 40,000 school places and provide for the replacement of over 600 prefabs, a key element of the prefab replacement programme.  I was asked how many students would be involved.  I will be happy to obtain the data for the committee at a later stage.<\/p><p> Another question concerned school laboratories, physical education halls and home economics facilities upgrades.  There is constant reconfiguration of internal parts of buildings, whether they are engineering rooms, art rooms or school laboratories.  With specific reference to PE halls, we are looking to the next ten-year capital plan.  We will introduce a pilot PE leaving certificate option in all schools by 2020 because there is weak infrastructure in PE hall provision throughout the country.  We are looking to move forward in that regard.<\/p><p> There is no point putting in place comprehensive PE infrastructure at secondary level if it is not done hand-in-glove in primary schools.  Throughout rural Ireland there are primary schools on the backs of hills that are not near community centres, parochial halls or parish centres.  We really need to focus on the sports infrastructure we want to provide at primary school level because the statistics suggest half of all girls drop out of physical activity when they reach the age of 12 or 13 years.  If we offer leaving certificate physical literacy or physical education classes when many of the target cohort have already dropped out, it will be a major challenge.  A body of work needs to be done in that regard.  Schools are being very creative and some have introduced sports in which we used to participate, including rounders and skipping, in addition to rugby, Gaelic football and soccer.<\/p><p> We need to keep a focus on the differences between physical education and physical activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#F00500","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>In the Revised Estimates 48 PE halls and 200 laboratories are provided for this year.<\/p><p>What is the procedure for getting one of these PE halls replaced or refurbished?

Not all secretaries fall into this complement.  We have 1978-79 solutions for some school secretaries.  When I go to primary schools and meet the secretaries, I find that they are very modest in highlighting the role they play.  However, they play an integral part of the school.  I met a school secretary in Drumshanbo in Leitrim yesterday.  The principal outlined all the work she does.  I am conscious that a body of work needs to be done there.

I am conscious that the day-to-day running of schools, including things such as oil, is a big issue.  The 5% increase in capitation was a start in the right direction.  I am conscious that it certainly is not far enough.<\/p> <p>  Improvements to the caretakers and secretaries grant were made in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 to enable schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers, to pay increases for cleaners and to implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  While there have been increases, I am conscious of the issue of the stability and certainty around the role of caretaking staff and some secretarial staff.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also made reference to replacement of prefabs.  I have been to many primary schools where some fifth and sixth class pupils have spent all their primary school education in prefabs.  Some of them are not in great shape but the schools are waiting for the new build or new extension to come along.<\/p><p>While much patience has been shown, sometimes that patience reaches a limit when it comes to trying to get the education environment in a good place.  We need to keep a strong focus on adapting the building suitability for autistic students and those with special needs, as is happening in some of the newer primary and secondary schools.<\/p><p> Deputy McLoughlin spoke about the capitation increase from last year and asked about next year's budget.  I am conscious that it was reduced by 11% in 2011, which was a big hit for schools.  While we have come back up by 5%, I acknowledge a body of work remains to be done there.  I discuss this with my officials weekly.  I re-emphasise - I know it is also coming from this committee - the importance of capitation.  We will look at that in the context of the next budget.<\/p><p> We will have an additional 950 SNAs this year, which will bring the cohort of SNAs up to about 16,000.  We have increased teaching staff by 372 this year.  That is part of an overall increase to the effectiveness of schools.  Yesterday in Scoil Naomh P&aacute;draig in Drumshanbo, the principal pointed out that the SNAs there keep the school moving.  That is how intrinsically linked they are to the school.  They do not work in silos and are very much part of that.  I am anxious to push ahead with the SNA recommendation.  We will look at a pilot in that area and I want to see more integration between the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  We will make that happen.  We will do a pilot in September.  We will look at key issues that were raised in this committee in my first week in the job about dealing with cases where a clinical nurse, a speech and language professional or an occupational therapist is needed.  We need to work in a more collective way on that.  That pilot will be the signalling post for how we develop in the future.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about school transport.  Anyone living in a rural constituency will know the phones start ringing in the last week in August.  There are issues.  In defence of Bus &Eacute;ireann, it has a mammoth task every year.  The numbers change every year with new people coming in and other people leaving.  Bus &Eacute;ireann obviously works within the rules and guidelines of the policy it is given.  I am working with the officials on the school transport area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has been very proactive in this area in applying more common sense in the area.  I know Deputy Funchion has raised this issue in respect of her constituency.  Sometimes local people can come up with a common-sense solution, but sometimes if the wall of policy comes up against them it can lead to unbelievable frustration.  I am very conscious we need to try to protect the integrity of certain parishes as best we can and the integrity of traditional school choice.  Sometimes the closest school might not be the traditional school of choice for many people.  When this change came in in 2012, it got rid of the closed school amalgamation rule.  It caused considerable upset in communities and I am working very closely with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#H01000","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Unfortunately I have to put this on the record.

We can see that they have been increasing in number.  The number provided is an estimated 15,950.  Does this figure come from the National Council for Special Education?  I am not querying it, but we still come across an awful lot of cases in which children, for whatever reason, may have to switch schools during school term, for example, at this time of year.  It could perhaps be down to there being some blockage in the system or a lack of common sense when it comes to dealing with these issues.  The children are told that if they switch school, they will not be able to have a special needs assistant until September.  Does the Minister have any information on this matter?  There are also cases in which the provision of a special needs assistant is recommended in the various reports people receive from psychologists, but the SENO overrules that recommendation.  Sometimes I wonder about the power SENOs have in making these decisions.  A number of professionals in the medical world might say a child would benefit from having access to a special needs assistant, but then the SENOs will say \"No\".  They never seem to have to give any detailed reason to a parent for the refusal, which can be quite difficult.  In our area there are two SENOs; therefore, there is not much wiggle room to speak to anyone else about the issue, but it still comes up.  Even though we have heard - it is a welcome development - special needs assistants are increasing in number, it seems there are still issues in certain areas.  Can this matter be raised with the National Council for Special Education?  It might not even have to do with the number of special needs assistants available; it could have to do with a breakdown in the system.  I wanted to take the opportunity to ask about this issue.

As we are dealing with the programme that covers salaries, I will call out the elephant in the room - pay inequality.  I am aware of the ruling of the European Court of Justice in recent weeks.  I would say the Government was pleased with it.  On the issue of age discrimination, it indicated that it was based more on the date of entry into a position, but that is a technicality when we all know that the vast majority of new entrants are young people.  It is young teachers who are continually being sold out.  The arrangement worked out by the Government in September which will take effect soon does not address the fundamental underlying issue, that is, the concept of equal pay for equal work.  Unlike his predecessor, I ask the Minister to recognise that principle.  Yesterday I read with interest the news of the job-sharing scheme for teachers.  Perhaps it is a necessary move, but it fundamentally misses the point as to why over 90% of schools are struggling to recruit teachers.  The reason is pay discrimination.  One cannot have partial equality, which is what seems to be envisioned by the Government's approach.  One cannot have a situation where everyone is equal but some are more equal than others.  That is how young teachers feel.  Therefore, I really urge the Minister to commit to recognising the principle of equal pay for equal work.  Recruitment and retention are issues because of the cost facing graduates of pursuing a two-year professional master's in education degree.<\/p><p>They are also a problem because of the working conditions, the initiative overload, with document after document and change after change coming in, the quality of resources, the facilities in the schools, the need for a supplementary panel and, needless to say, the class sizes.<\/p><p> Another point is the superannuation section under this heading.  In recent years we have approved substantial Supplementary Estimates every year to deal with unexpected expenditure and every year we bring this up.  Has the Minister managed to sort out this anomaly?  I would be grateful if he would provide an update on plans to develop a sustainable superannuation forecasting and funding model and a timeline for its completion.<\/p><p> Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Thomas Byrne brought up the issue of PE halls.  I know the Minister said he was conscious of the fact that there is weak infrastructure.  I would like a little more light shed on this because since my election to the D&aacute;il, I have asked for an audit of all schools so we can establish exactly how many schools do not have PE halls.  However, every time I table this question there is a refusal to answer it.  Yes, there is one in my constituency but there are others.  I just do not understand how PE can be rolled out fairly and equally when there are students without PE halls, so I ask again for that audit.<\/p><p> I welcome the funding being allocated to well-being, following our own report on positive mental health in schools, including the funding for ten additional education psychologists.  Does the Minister have plans to increase these numbers in the future?<\/p><p> Finally, while the Minister is here, I wish to bring up the recent call for geography to be restored as a core subject in the junior cycle curriculum.  I welcome that he is reviewing the dropping of history.  I really plead with him to review the decision to remove geography as a core subject too.  We have students outside Leinster House every Friday.  We have a movement for climate strike across the world led by Greta Thunberg on 15 March.  Our students get it.  Geography is crucial in educating our students on one of the most urgent issues facing humankind, and it is shocking that this Government would move to remove geography as a core subject.  I ask the Minister to reconsider, as he did with history, the removal of geography and to please restore it as a core subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#K00900","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions and observations.  I will start with Deputy Funchion's queries.  We covered transportation but I will give her a few figures.  She asked about the amount of money involved yearly.  The cost of the school transport scheme in 2018 amounted to &euro;200 million.  This is an increase from over &euro;171 million in 2011.  The main reason for this increase in cost is the provision of special educational needs transport, which now accounts for over 50% of the total cost of the scheme.  I am quite conscious that many of our very vulnerable young people have to travel large distances to get to the appropriate school.  This is very evident when I visit mainstream schools and special schools.<\/p> <p>  The number of children on special educational needs, SEN, transport has increased from 9,200 pupils in 2013 to more than 13,000 pupils in 2018.  This is reflected in the increase in classes as well.  The number of special classes has gone from 475 to about 1,500 this year.  The cost of the provision of SEN transport has increased from just over &euro;60 million in 2011 to &euro;106 million in 2018.  Lastly, for the purpose of the public record of the committee, the main cost of contractors providing SEN services rose from around &euro;42 million in 2011 to &euro;73 million in 2018.  The cost of the provision of school bus escorts has gone from &euro;15 million to &euro;29 million in 2018.<\/p><p>That is not where the complication is.  As the Deputy correctly identified, the complication relates to school transport and getting children to a traditional school of choice or a school that respects the integrity of their area.  That is mainly a matter for primary level.  The changes we are seeking to make relate to second level schools.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to special needs assistants and complications there and used the term \"blockage in the system\".  The people who come to my constituency office are waiting for a diagnosis report.  I want to get away from that as do the members of the committee.  We all want the same model whereby the school is profiled rather than to have one-to-one special needs assistance.  One of the key recommendations of the SNA review was around the stigmatisation and alienation children in fourth, fifth and sixth class feel with one-to-one SNA provision.  That is at one level.  The Deputy was talking about the more complex area.  I want to focus on the pilot project we will commence in September to see how we can take a more integrated approach to identify a young person's needs at preschool level rather than to require parents to go through the hardship and difficulty of dealing with matters at the first point of entry into primary school.  A great deal of the knowledge, data and intelligence the system has at preschool should determine what happens at primary school.  It is about reprofiling the schools whereby the school does not rely on demand-led, one-to-one assessment or diagnosis.  We need to get away from that system.<\/p><p> I hope through our vigilance at political level, we can consider how to take a more joined-up approach, including to the training SNAs need.  Even where children have complex medical needs, parents want their children to be in a mainstream setting.  They want that choice and we should be able to afford it to them.  However, it will require the training of SNAs.  We do not have a higher training authority for SNAs currently but that will go hand in glove with the pilot project.  It will ensure the experience SNAs have built up over the last two decades will be taken into account where they seek to retrain and equip themselves with the skills needed for more complex cases.  They will be afforded the opportunity to do that.  Many SNAs want certainty.  Trying to find a job is difficult.  I hear from my colleagues nationally that even though we have 16,000 SNAs, representing a 45% increase since 2011, that uncertainty continues to exist because the SNA follows the student instead of working under a whole-school model which provides greater long-term certainty.  That is the place I want to get to.  With the committee's help, there will be other areas in which we can work together.<\/p><p> Deputy Naughton raised the matter of DEIS schools.  DEIS schools were selected on a geographical basis.  As a result, geographical areas which did not fall into particular socioeconomic categories were completely left out.  I have received a lot of representations from schools which are not in the DEIS programme.  Whereas in the past DEIS status was somewhat of a stigma and schools were questioning whether or not to enter the scheme, we have the opposite situation now.  Schools that have DEIS status want to maintain it and those without it want it because they see how it contributes to the development of the individual child.   We have collected all the data and will be ready at the end of the first quarter of 2019 to carry out a demographic and socioeconomic analysis of the country with a view to putting in place a more gradual and targeted approach to DEIS.  It will require a great deal of work to ensure we meet the needs of the most vulnerable in schools.  It is a matter of different DEIS bands for some schools while other schools see value in home-school liaison.  There is a meal programme and other extra resources to address class size, for example.  All of these provide added advantages for a school.  One of the things I will make an integral part of the three-year plan for the Department is bridging the gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools.  It is already happening to an extent, but there is more we can do to advance the process.<\/p><p>The other thing is to look at progression.  We are very lucky in where we have got to in the space of ten years.  For example, staff at Larkin Community College in Dublin city centre tell me they now have an 80% progression rate to diploma, apprenticeship and higher and third level education.  It represents massive progress at that DEIS school.  A lot of schools are aiming to replicate that achievement and I want to look at a more targeted approach to help them.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin referred to new entrant teachers and equal pay for equal work.  I am on the public record as saying there is unfinished business in this regard.  Obviously, we are working within the parameters of the public sector stability agreement.  I am conscious of the fact one creates that vulnerability in a staff room setting where some people around the table for a cup of tea are getting less money than others to do the same job.  It is a negative of which I am conscious.  The unions are working on this and it is something I have discussed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  I am also conscious that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has been through this in the context of the recent nurses' strike.  I want to create a pathway whereby we have done work prior to the end of 2020 to bring about this resolution.  There were changes in 2011 to the grade at which primary and secondary school teachers came into the system.  It is about acknowledgement of the higher diploma in education for secondary teachers and of the post-graduate certificate of education which primary school teachers hold.  I want to continue to work within the framework of the public service stability agreement to see how we can move towards a place in the next round where this is eliminated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#L00200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Towards equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Can I clarify that the Minister means the next round of pay talks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Yes, at the end of 2020.  It may be that there are things that can be done within the existing framework.  Obviously, I respect collective bargaining.

However, I am conscious of the fact that they took a reduction.  To acknowledge the higher diploma and primary teaching qualification will cost &euro;43 million.  These are the figures we are looking at and must work with within the existing mechanisms.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin referred to the job-sharing scheme yesterday.  Education and training boards worked with that scheme in the 1970s and some secondary schools have engaged in job-sharing on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis more recently.  It will not address the big issue of teacher supply, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00500","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00600","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I am under no illusion there.  If there is a maths teacher in a base school on 12 hours and the whole school is looking for seven hours, common sense can be applied and joined-up thinking can be engaged in.  Principals who spot that opportunity will go for it.  Having spoken to them, I know it is about timetabling.  If there are distances involved, the teacher has to be compensated for the time spent travelling and the interruption to his or her day.  Where teacher approval is being granted by the Department, officials have to ensure the teacher does not have to travel during the day.  It should be about going to one of the schools on one day and the other on another day.  I re-emphasise, however, that it is not a solution to the teacher supply issue overall, albeit I encourage principals to work on it.  I know they will.  Deputy Martin also mentioned recruitment and retention which is a big issue.<\/p><p>Looking at the new courses, especially the masters courses we introduced this year in Mary Immaculate College, and at other courses at undergraduate level, it takes time to do that.  As a strong advocate of returning to education, I am also conscious that it is very difficult for somebody who is in the circle of paying bills and mortgages to go back to it full-time.  We increased the funding for student support this year as well.  I am conscious of the retention issue.  There are initiatives within the teacher supply consortium that is up and running, but I wish to examine ways of trying to address the issue that there are a number of teachers in the south east of England and in the United Arab Emirates.  We must be practical in the conversations we have with them.  It is not necessarily to encourage them because many teachers are waiting for the prospect of getting a job.  It is the not knowing, certainty around that and when interviews are held.  I am doing a piece of work with my officials on that.<\/p><p> The Deputy spoke about initiative overload.  That is something I am hearing about from the staff room.  A great deal of change is happening, much of it good.  The schools I visit around the country are doing the well-being part very well.  They are considering creative ways.  They are doing the social inclusion part.  Teaching is happening in a very holistic way in schools.  Central to the way teaching is taking place today, from my observations, is the dignity and respect piece in the school setting, that is, the way teachers respect young people, young people respect teachers, respecting the whole school environment, having parents and the community front and centre and the integration of business not just within secondary schools but also within primary schools.  We can learn a great deal from what is happening in schools for developing our policies.  The well-being policy is working very well.  It is trying to get students in touch with their issues and to be honest and upfront about the challenges they face.<\/p><p> The Deputy spoke about the audit of all schools.  A piece of work was done a number of years ago on an audit of all school buildings.  Secondary schools are probably in a better position than primary schools.  It is a big piece of work.  I emphasised that there is a weakness in this infrastructure and we must try to find a way of doing it.  If we were to use the full &euro;8.4 billion on building gymnasiums in all 4,000 primary and secondary schools, it would not be enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#N00700","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>How many second level schools in Ireland do not have a PE hall?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#O00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I can get the Deputy that number.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#O00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#O00400","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to funding for well-being.

There has been a big change in the way we look at history in the last four to five years.  I believe 2016 contributed to that.  There is a yearning to find out more about our past.  That is the motivation I had for the history review.  It will only be a history review.

If we look at Ennis - the Acting Chairman mentioned Gorey - we must keep this under constant review.  From my empirical data and conversations with colleagues, planning permission applications are coming in fast and furious.  To use Gorey as an example, if there is an increase in the number of housing estates and the amount of development there, then the school must have a plan for the next five to ten years.

Are more planned for this year?  I refer particularly to the tourism sector, where there is still a lot of reliance on people coming in from outside to work in the sector.  I know there are apprenticeships in that area and that there are also some very good training programmes.  I am aware of one in my own constituency, provided by the Limerick Enterprise Development Partnership, LEDP, which is run through the ETB.

I will respond to Deputy Catherine Martin ar dt&uacute;s.  On female participation, the Deputy pointed to the positive aspects and asked why this is happening.  We have to be in the realistic space as well; we have a lot more to do there.  A number of reports have highlighted that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is still low, which is reflective of the traditionally low levels of female employment in the craft sector.  I have had preliminary discussions with a number of officials in SOLAS on this issue.<\/p><p>Sometimes in life, the things that are staring us straight in the face are the things we may take for granted.  In my own county, SOLAS is looking at the traditional craft sector to see what it can do in respect of apprenticeships.  SOLAS offers a bursary to craft employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices but the uptake by women is still very low.  To provide a few more figures, at the end of 2018 there were 341 female apprentices registered, more than double the 2017 figure of 151.  That is the positive aspect to which the Deputy alluded.  While this is welcome, it is also important to address issues influencing the low level of recruitment of women in the craft sector.  SOLAS has completed a review of the pathways to participation in apprenticeship for under-represented groups, including women.  Areas highlighted for action include setting targets for female participation, considering extending the craft employer bursary to other apprenticeships with less than 20% female participation, and a specific focus on female participation as part of the Generation Apprenticeship national promotional campaign.  Women now feature prominently in all aspects of the national promotional campaign, where there is a specific focus on encouraging women and girls to consider apprenticeships as a means of launching or developing their careers.<\/p><p> We will be doing the career guidance review in the coming weeks and a number of suggestions have been made through this committee on career guidance.  We have a body of work on how we can support career guidance teachers more in terms of the information they have.  The information available at junior certificate and leaving certificate level is critical, including information about different industries, apprenticeships, a higher diploma or higher education.  We have to be aware than an information vacuum can exist.  This is not the fault of the career guidance teachers.  There could be one career guidance teacher for a whole school and he or she is not going to be able to develop individual career paths for every student.  We must address how to make that information more accessible to the student cohort.<\/p><p> I am aware that they do something very collaborative in Limerick.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan might be able to shed more light on that.  I only found out about it from my trip to Limerick.  They bring together the third level institutions, the ETB, SOLAS, all the different stakeholders and the young people in a single environment once a year.  That type of information sharing is so important.  Returning to Deputy Catherine Martin's question, the future skills forum is also contributing to this dissemination of information.  It is done on a regional basis, which is critical.  When I was in Drumshanbo yesterday, I came across two more potential apprenticeships there, one in the area of beauty and healthcare and the other in organic farming.  They are really tapping into the possibilities around tourism as well, which Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned.  <\/p><p> On the National Training Fund and the human capital issue, from January 2020 a new ring-fenced funding line, the human capital initiative, will be established within the National Training Fund to invest &euro;60 million per annum from the accumulated surplus over a five-year period.  This ring-fenced allocation will total &euro;300 million over the period from 2020 to 2024.  It will form a key part of the strategic response to Brexit and other challenges.  Deputy McLoughlin mentioned funding for apprenticeships.  I acknowledge the role played by all the different service providers in this area.  The 2019 budget allocation for apprenticeship training is &euro;142 million, which represents an increase of over 16% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;122 million.  The 2019 allocation is apportioned between SOLAS, which is allocated &euro;105 million, and the HEA, which is allocated &euro;37 million.  It will support an apprenticeship population forecast to be in excess of 18,000 by the end of 2019, and new registrations forecast to be in excess of 7,000 in the same year.<\/p><p>The findings of a recent study that appeared in<i>The Irish Times<\/i>showed that multinational companies held in equal esteem graduates from higher level institutions and universities and from apprenticeships.  We have to ensure we continue to send the message to young people that the race for points to go to university will not be a perfect fit for all students.  The great work being done in promoting apprenticeships is central to the conversation.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised an issue about funding from the European Social Fund.  I remember that the applications for funding from some Youthreach programmes had not been submitted in time.  I have raised this matter with my officials and efforts will be made to try to ensure we will not have to wait for a Supplementary Estimate to be presented.<br\/><br\/>The Acting Chairman raised an issue about the provision being made for the payment of pensions.  A great deal of work goes into coming up with figures for how many teachers will retire, but the reason we had to present a Supplementary Estimate for &euro;144 million was insufficient money had been put aside in the initial Estimate.  I am confident that the Department will be in position this year because of the new increased baseline figure of &euro;1.35 billion.  My three predecessors in the Department since 2011 evaluated correctly the figures for the numbers who would retire, but the resources were not available in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the reason the Department had to prepare a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#S00700","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>What the Minister has just said is that the Department knew how many teachers would be retiring but did not provide for it in the Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>No, the Department estimated the numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>It did not provide for them because it had to present a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The Department had to have a conversation with the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform to obtain sanction to incur the expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00500","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Therefore, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned funding that was less than expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019022600002#U00600","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>It was not a question of sanctioning funding that was less than expenditure; it was a case of meeting expenditure within the available resources.

The allocation for each scheme is determined as part of the annual Estimates process.  The NTF is included as an annexe to the published Estimates of the Department and such funding has been included in the overall expenditure ceiling for the Department of Education and Skills since 2011.  This means that overall expenditure from the fund cannot be increased even where receipts increase, without a corresponding drop in voted expenditure.  The surplus remains available for investment in education and training programmes to meet skill needs.  Prior to 2012, income from the National Training Fund levy had fallen from a high of &euro;413 million in 2008 to &euro;299 million.  However, since 2012, receipts from the NTF levy have increased annually due to improved employment levels.  The accumulated surplus in the fund has been critical in maintaining expenditure levels, particularly in the provision of training for the unemployed in a period when receipts were falling.  It is considered prudent to continue to maintain an adequate surplus in the fund to meet demand in future years and while the surplus represents a very significant sum, it would only cover seven months NTF expenditure at current levels.  The surplus remains available for investment in education and training programmes to meet skill needs.<\/p> <p>  I alluded earlier to the reform of the National Training Fund.

The Law Reform Commission is a statutory research and advisory body.  While our title says \"law reform\", we cannot actually do law reform as this is a matter for the committee members as legislators.  We are delighted that the committee has taken an interest in this particular report in the context of the committee's discussion on accountability in banking.  We are highly conscious that the committee has previously taken a great interest in the work of the commission, most recently in the detailed scrutiny it carried out on the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017 that was related to the previous work of the commission.  We thank the committee for the great interest it has already shown in our work.  We try to include draft Bills or schemes of Bills in our reports, which we hope the Government and the Oireachtas will find helpful.<\/p><p>We place great emphasis in our written opening statement - I will not go through all of it given the time constraints today - and take very seriously the consultative process of how we put together programmes of law reform, under which we carry out most of our work, and in the consultative process on the fourth programme of law reform, considering both the issue of the powers of financial and economic regulators and the related issue of corporate criminal liability.  Many of our consultees indicated that it was important to examine both of these areas.  We recognise that the committee is particularly focused on financial services and on the role of the Central Bank.<\/p><p> In the consultations that we held on the fourth programme, other regulators were also mentioned as being important as to the systemic risks to the State that might arise in the future.  Our report includes not just issues relating to the Central Bank and its powers, but also other sectoral regulators on which we note there have been a number of policy documents, including the 2013 document Regulating for a Better Future and the 2017 document on measures to improve Ireland's accountability on the issue of financial and economic regulation and white collar crime, as it is sometimes described.<\/p><p> We take consultation as a very important part of our work and receive a tremendous amount of input in that respect from Government offices, relevant interested parties and NGOs, in the analysis that we carry out.  That was certainly the case with this particular report, to include the context of the 2016 annual conference where we focused on this particular area.  We heard from a number of national and international speakers with expertise in both regulatory powers and in corporate criminal liability.<\/p><p> We recognise that in the choices we make in a report there are number of possible options in looking at many of the complex issues.  We are very conscious that this is a matter that must be moved on to the Government and the Oireachtas for final decision on whether to implement the recommendations of the commission.  <\/p><p> The banking crisis that emerged in 2008 and the activities of banks that led up to that was certainly a context and background to this report.  We are very conscious also that a number of studies have been done, notably by the banking inquiry that was carried out in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We looked at that in how we analysed the issues that needed to be addressed.<\/p><p> We are also very conscious of some of what the former Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan described as \"egregiously reckless risk-taking\".  We recognise that there were issues that needed to be identified in order to examine what further reforms might be needed.<\/p><p> We acknowledge that there have been quite a number of significant changes enacted since 2008 both at national level here in the Oireachtas and at EU level with the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We also note in our report a number of reforms that had previously been made, for example in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, had been used effectively in criminal prosecutions.  We do not propose or comment on particular cases or their outcomes but we note that in the report.<\/p><p> There are more than 200 recommendations. I am informed by our maths experts in the research team that there are, in fact, 202 recommendations but I will not go through all of them.  I will focus on a number of the key recommendations here.<\/p><p> On the proposal for a corporate crime agency,  we have looked at the extent to which financial and economic regulators have sufficient powers in their regulatory toolkit in order to make sufficient financial sanctions and make regulatory enforcement agreements or settlements.  We also looked at the issue of egregiously reckless risk-taking and what reforms might be done in the criminal law in that area.  We also looked at the role that deferred prosecution agreements, DPAs, or in effect the suspension of criminal prosecutions, play and the extent to which these DPAs might have a role to play in the overall context of ensuring accountability.<\/p><p> In considering the first of those proposals, that being, on a corporate crime agency, we are conscious that the Government's 2017 paper, entitled \"Measures to Enhance Ireland's Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework\", made a number of important recommendations, some of which are being acted on now.  One recommendation was on the establishment of a corporate enforcement authority as a replacement for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, as a separate entity rather than as a unit within the parent Department.  The LRC's proposal on a corporate crime agency is separate from that.  Our proposal would see a corporate crime agency with power to engage in prosecutions that did not fall within the remit of any of the regulators, be it the Central Bank, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, ComReg or the proposed corporate enforcement authority.  Under the relevant Bill, which is under pre-legislative scrutiny at the moment, the corporate enforcement authority would be limited to enforcement of the Companies Act 2014.  The LRC's proposal is that the corporate crime agency would have a wider remit.<\/p><p> We understand from the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny of the corporate enforcement authority Bill conducted this month by another committee that the review group on anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures is engaged in a review of our recommendation.  We also understand that the group is to make its own recommendations later this year.<\/p><p> The associated proposal in the LRC's report was that there ought to be a continuation of the dedicated unit on corporate crime that is already established in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It has dealt with prosecutions post 2008.  The LRC recommends that the unit work closely with the proposed corporate crime agency.  It is important that the committee be aware that the LRC recommended strongly in its report that, based on experience of poorly resourced agencies, the corporate crime agency and the dedicated unit in the DPP's office should be properly and fully resourced.  This matter is outside the remit of the LRC and we cannot carry out that kind of economic analysis of what sort of resources would be required, but we emphasised this recommendation in our report.<\/p><p> I will not go through all of the powers that would be found in a full toolkit of regulatory powers for financial and economic regulators, but of the six core ones mentioned in our submission, we speak in particular about the power to impose administrative financial sanctions and emphasise that, in order to ensure that it would meet constitutional requirements, it must be subject to court oversight and approval.  This would be similar to the Central Bank's current powers in terms of what can be imposed as a maximum sanction of &euro;10 million and-or 10% of turnover for companies and a maximum sanction of &euro;1 million for individuals.  In addition, all financial and economic regulators should have the power to enter into regulatory compliance agreements or settlements.  This would include the power to impose financial sanctions, put in place consumer redress schemes and agree to put in place corporate compliance policies.  The committee will be aware that the Central Bank already has these powers.  We make some recommendations on how we believe they could be improved, particularly in terms of the investigative process, but we also recommend that other regulators, such as the competition commission and ComReg, be given those powers as well.  We have made recommendations on the process by which inquiries are conducted by the Central Bank.  Their efficiency could be improved comparable to what has been put in place in the Medical Council's fitness to practise process.<\/p><p> Regarding the use of criminal law in this context, the former Governor of the Central Bank referred to the need to have in place appropriate criminal law enforcement mechanisms to deal with egregiously reckless risk taking.  The LRC examined two related aspects of this, namely, the extent to which the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 should be amended and whether there was a case to be made for the introduction of an offence specifically called \"reckless trading\".  The LRC came to the conclusion that it would be appropriate to amend the Act in order to provide that there should be an explicit reference to recklessness in that context.<\/p><p>That would mean, for example, in the context of the offence of false accounting under the 2001 Act, that it would occur not only where the accounts were fabricated knowingly and intentionally - the current law - but also where it was done with subjective recklessness, namely, where the defendant consciously disregarded a risk that the victim would be deceived by the false accounting.  On the 2001 Act, the commission concluded in its chapter dealing with reckless trading that it would not be appropriate to put in place an offence of reckless trading on the basis that it would either be an offence that would not be enforceable in practice or that it would have a potentially chilling effect on legitimate risk-taking.  <\/p><p> On the other aspect of powers to take a criminal prosecution, the commission examined whether a statutory deferred prosecution agreement, DPA, should be introduced.  This is a procedure whereby a prosecution can be suspended or put in abeyance by the prosecution, pending compliance and subject to compliance with strict conditions set out in the deferred prosecution agreement which would be a published document, rather than a private agreement.  The commission recommended that there was a case to be made for introducing deferred prosecution agreements, subject to the control of the Director of Public Prosecutions who would work closely with financial and economic regulators in determining whether a DPA was suitable in a particular case.  We recommended that the model that had been in place in the United Kingdom since 2013 under legislation which required court approval for any proposed DPA was the preferred model.  There is a DPA model in the United States, with which members will probably be familiar, but it is not on a statutory basis.  It is not subject to court approval and is at the discretion of a relevant prosecutor.  Therefore, the commission concluded that it would not be an appropriate model to use.<\/p><p> Another issue that arises in the context of criminal law in respect of corporate liability is due diligence.  The committee might be glad to know that this is the last of the main issues on which I will address it today.  The commission recommended that for most corporate offences of a regulatory type, it would be appropriate to have in place a due diligence defence.  For example, where an organisation has put in place suitable risk management procedures, this would be a defence.  If an organisation does not have in place suitable risk management policies and procedures, it would mean that there would be a conviction.  The purpose is for this approach to fit with the approach taken by a lot of the regulators to encourage organisations to put in place the resources required to have a sufficient risk management appetite, whether in the context of financial services or any other aspect of economic activity in which the corporate entity would be engaged.  The commission considered, taking account of all of the literature in this area, that it would be appropriate to have the defence in place for most of the regulatory type offences for which regulators had responsibility.  It would not be appropriate as a defence in the case of a fraud offence because it would involve either intentional or knowing behaviour or, if the commission's recommendations were to be implemented, reckless behaviour.  It would be illogical and inconsistent to say that if an organisation had policies and procedures in place to prevent it from doing something intentionally, it could be a defence.  We also recommend, in the context of organisations taking legal advice, that it could be taken into account but only in sentencing.  In other words, it would not be a defence in a prosecution.  <\/p><p> In the context of a related issue, sometimes referred to as officially induced error, the question is whether, if a regulator in the financial and economic area gave advice which seemed to indicate that everything was in compliance with the legislation, it would be a defence.  The commission was of the view that the matter would have to be dealt with on a case-by-case or factual basis.  If the facts of the case established that there was so-called officially induced error, in which instance it was reasonable to rely on the advice of a regulator, and that the advice had been authoritative and applied, it would either be a defence or prevent a prosecution from proceeding.  We note that the Supreme Court, in a decision last Thursday, appeared to indicate that such a defence would be available in an appropriate case, but in the particular circumstances of the case before it, it did not apply.<\/p><p> What we tried to do was insofar as we could take account of international best practice in the review of literature carried out by the research team on behalf of the commission in developing the report which was published last October.<\/p><p>The international literature from the OECD, the EU and those with expertise in this area indicates that administrative financial sanctions and the power to enter into regulatory settlements are key parts of a good regulatory toolkit.  While the commission suggests that the criminal law reforms which are proposed in the report do not in any sense guarantee that the issues which have arisen in the past can be prevented in the future, it recommends that they could provide an element of deterrence in terms of the risk-taking that has been referred to by the former Governor, Professor Honohan, in the past.  We recognise that it is up to the Government and the Oireachtas, including this committee, to determine whether all of these recommendations ought to be implemented.  On behalf of the commission, I welcome the committee's interest in this area.  My colleagues and I will be very happy to take any questions that members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their publication on this issue and their numerous other pieces of work.  Mr. Byrne mentioned the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017, which I have sponsored.  This simple Bill, which was drafted by the Law Reform Commission, only requires a number of tweaks so that it can be updated on foot of relevant legislation that has been passed since it was published.  I hope it will progress through the committee at a future point.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask Mr. Byrne about the commission's approach to some of the matters he has raised.  I have brought legislation on reckless lending before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission considers that an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, as opposed to the introduction of a stand-alone offence of reckless lending, would be sufficient.  Although I have listened to what Mr. Byrne has said, I do not understand the approach that is being taken.  I ask him to explain to me whether there needs to be a victim.  If the offence the commission is suggesting were to be introduced by means of an amendment to the theft and fraud Act, would there need to be a victim?  Can Mr. Byrne explain why the commission is not in favour of what has been done in Britain and Australia and what has been suggested by the former Governor of the Central Bank?  I refer to the proposal to make reckless lending in itself an offence, as opposed to making an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#L00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I can certainly start to answer the Deputy's question.  I am sure Mr. O'Malley will have something to say about this issue as well.  An amendment to the 2001 Act would not be necessary.  I referred in my opening statement to a victim.  The way in which the current offence is defined means it does not necessarily have to be the case that an actual loss needs to have occurred.  Deception does not necessarily have to involve a loss.  The potential for a loss is the relevant factor.  In particular, that might arise in the context of activities where it could not be established that there was a loss.  I was indicating in the context of the amendments that in cases of what might be defined as deception for these purposes, it would be sufficient to establish that there was a conscious disregard of the risk of causing a loss or creating a profit.  This would be sufficient to establish a defence.<\/p> <p>  The commission examined the provisions in the UK and Australia in detail.  We recognise that the former Governor, Professor Honohan, made a suggestion with regard to the UK offence of engaging in reckless activity that might cause a bank to fail.  It focuses specifically on a banking failure.  The commission examined that suggestion in detail.  I would like to comment on the detail of that offence.  It appears that there would be a very high burden on the prosecution to establish how it could be that a particular act or series of acts by senior managers within a bank actually caused that bank to fail.  The commission felt that this was a particularly high burden in the context of this particular offence.<\/p><p>It may very well be that that offence would be suitable, but in the analysis that the commission carried out, it felt that the burden on the prosecution would be quite a high one.  In relation to the Australian example, there certainly is an offence that describes itself as reckless trading but it would appear that in practice in Australia, insofar as that provision is used, it really is related to circumstances where there is intentional or knowing fraud.  Therefore, while it appears to address the question of reckless trading, in practice it appeared to the commission, insofar as we could see what was happening in Australia, to be related to intentional or knowing behaviour.  That is the reason, in a sense, that we came back to looking at the 2001 Act, which is quite wide in scope and, therefore, would address many issues, obviously in the banking context but also in wider contexts where one might not necessarily be talking about a banking failure.  That was the analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I will put it in the context of our past experience although we are dealing with future law which cannot be applied to the past, lest anyone think I am suggesting anything else.  The majority of the public believe that what happened in Anglo Irish Bank was reckless and there was reckless lending.  The layperson believes that and I certainly believe that.  I also understand that we do not have any law against reckless lending in itself so one cannot suggest it was a crime because there was no law against it.<\/p> <p>  Would the definition proposed by the Law Reform Commission in terms of conscious, objective recklessness be sufficient to ensure that individuals could be prosecuted if another institution engaged in a repeat of the activities evident in Anglo Irish Bank, for example?  That is the test I would put to any insertion of reckless lending into primary legislation.  Could we prosecute?  Could we jail the bankers in the future if they continue to do what they did in the past?  In my view, as I said to some of them, they should have been jailed for what they did, but it was not a crime and that is our fault.  That is the fault of the establishment, the people who did not pass laws to make those actions a crime.  We are now proposing to make such actions a crime.

The commission does not generally comment on individual cases but we have noted in the report that a number of situations did arise where prosecutions under the existing law, which requires intention or knowledge, led to convictions.  What we suggest, although it is very difficult to always predict exactly how a law will work out, is that it would be useful to include in the definition of what amounts to fraudulent activity the concept of subjective recklessness in the criminal law, namely, the mental element or <i>mens rea<\/i>of offences.  Therefore, while it is impossible to predict what exactly might happen in the future, the commission felt that it would be appropriate to include that concept of subjective recklessness.  The word &quot;reckless&quot; would by definition then be included in the mental element of the offence.  Mr. O'Malley will be better able to talk about the detail of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I agree with that, but one comment I would make is that when one analyses a lot of the cases that have come before the courts here and elsewhere - there have been a number of prosecutions over the years arising from the matter mentioned by Deputy Pearse Doherty - one of the problems is that it can be quite difficult to affix responsibility to individuals within organisations.  If responsibility is diffused, as by necessity it is in a very large organisation, whether it is a commercial or public one, it can be quite difficult to affix blame to anybody.<\/p><p>It is difficult even to affix sufficient suspicion to a person to justify a prosecution to begin with.  While there is no magic solution to this, the best way forward, as Mr. Byrne said, is to include recklessness as a sufficient mental element for the crime.  In other words, the law as it stands requires the prosecution to prove that a person acted intentionally, which means it was his or her specific purpose to bring about a specific result, or knowingly acted in the sense that he or she knew exactly what was being done and still intended to bring about the result.  If that were broadened out to include recklessness, a higher standard of care or level of responsibility would be imposed on people to ensure they did not take unjustified risks.  That is what recklessness is about.  It is about the taking of unjustified risks.  The word \"unjustified\" is very important in that context.  As Mr. Byrne pointed out in his opening statement, a major challenge we have to meet and which everyone must address in the context of corporate regulation is to strike an appropriate balance between encouraging enterprise and legitimate risk taking on the one hand and ensuring wrongdoing is outlawed on the other.  Hopefully, the concept of recklessness we recommend will strike an appropriate balance.  Certainly, it is well worth consideration on the part of the Legislature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Why make provision under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act which provides for offences with victims on the other side?

Wrongfully seeking to make a gain for oneself, even if there is no identifiable victim, still comes within the definition of these particular offences.  The recklessness would be as to the nature of the conduct in which the person is engaging.

In this particular instance, the proposal the commission makes is that at all different levels of responsibility, there is a requirement that there be communication up and down.  The Central Bank's senior management proposal, for example, would identify particular roles and responsibilities.  The commission's proposal, which is related to so-called derivative liability or parasitic liability, provides that, regardless of whether one has an identified role and regardless of whether the Central Bank would impose a particular line of duty, if it can be shown that someone in a senior policy-making function in the organisation - whether he or she is called the chief executive officer, senior financial officer or corporate financial officer - has failed in his or her duties, he or she can be held personally accountable, as well as the corporate entity.  The two of them are complementary.  The commission's proposal on derivative liability would ensure that in a particular instance where everybody except the chief executive officer has taken a particular role and responsibility, the CEO of the organisation would still be held accountable under the derivative liability proposals of the commission, even if for some reason he or she had persuaded everybody else to take on particular roles and the CEO had not taken on a particular role.

I appreciate that the recommendations that are being put forward by the Law Reform Commission add to our toolkit and strengthen our hand in relation to ensuring that criminal activity in institutions or at an individual level can be prosecuted, which will hopefully act as a deterrent.  That being said, I still believe the measures are quite weak.  I accept the witnesses have spoken about individual accountability but we are currently able to prosecute individuals who should have acted or taken notice or for whom alarm bells should have rung in relation to their specific functions within a financial institution.  I am only a layperson but the problem as I see it is that their activities are not illegal.  This goes back to the fact that if we had a banker before us, we could say he or she should not have done this or that but there is no sanction in the law for doing it.  There was nothing wrong with a banker going to a hotel down the road and giving a cheque to a developer for &euro;230 million without any proper scrutiny as to whether that was appropriate or if it would make the bank go bust.  We are told that despite &euro;1 billion having to be returned to individuals in the tracker scandal, there was really nothing wrong in it.  The problem with holding individuals to account is that if we continue to say that the practices that are happening or could potentially happen in the future are okay, what is the point?  If an individual accepts responsibility for something and says that it was his or her call, so what?  It can be described as an administrative error and every bank made the same administrative error but that is just coincidence.  I appreciate that this is a step forward but I am not convinced.  When I look at two of the major financial scandals we have had to endure in the past decade, namely, the collapse of some of the banks and the way in which lending operated, I am not convinced that the introduction of the measures outlined would result in more bankers being jailed as a result of their conduct.  Likewise, I do not know whether anybody would go to prison or would even be sacked.  Nobody has been sacked and a number of people have even been promoted within the banks following the tracker scandal.  I am not sure that this cuts it, but I appreciate that it gives extra teeth.  We are ten years on from the scandal.  While we have changed laws and increased regulation, that fact that we have still not dealt with individual accountability in financial institutions screams loudly about the establishment and how it is protecting institutions.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that, but I would like to hear the witnesses' response to see if they can convince me that I am wrong and that this report is the bee's knees.

I am not saying this is the last word; perhaps other criminal offences could be thought of.  We must remember this gets down to a very basic policy question about the reach we wish to have in the criminal law, as opposed to other aspects of law.  One of the constraints under which the Oireachtas operates when it comes to defining new criminal offences is that under the Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights, every criminal offence must be clearly and specifically defined.  There is a right to fair labelling and fair warning so that a person can know in advance precisely what is permitted by law and precisely what is prohibited by law.  Therefore any criminal offence that is created must be sufficiently clearly defined so that a person can look it at advance and say, \"If I do this I am within the law; if I do that I am outside the law.\"  I am not suggesting that the kinds of issues the Deputy is raising could not be accommodated within a properly defined criminal offence; I am just saying that is one of the challenges that will always have to be addressed.  It is purely a matter of fairness as much as anything else.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the previous point, as opposed to the one the Deputy just mentioned, as a general policy for deterring criminal conduct on the part of people working in the financial sector, which is really what we want to do, the combination of the corporate offence and the personal liability that might attach to individual officers and so on should be quite effective.  I say should be quite effective in the sense that obviously the only penalty that can be imposed on a corporate entity, in effect, is a financial penalty, a fine, whereas of course if dealing with human defendants who are convicted of offences, clearly the penalties can be much more onerous through imprisonment and so forth.  One would hope that the combination of these two - that a company may be very severely punished with a financial penalty and that individuals within the company may find themselves suffering deprivation of liberty as well as deprivation of property - should be fairly effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Justice Laffoy for her opening statement and for the work the Law Reform Commission is doing on the matter.

One could say there are different proportions when Ireland and Iceland are compared.  On the other hand, there have been a number of significant prosecutions and convictions.  In looking at this very wide-ranging issue, the commission recognised that there was the issue around corporate liability and personal liability of senior managers, and then also the kinds of tools that regulators in the financial and economic sector need in order to have effective preventive measures in place.<\/p><p>We also recognise that this is very much a complex jigsaw and that, as has been said before, since 2008 there have been quite a significant number of reforms in the financial services area and additional powers given to the Central Bank in order to monitor the extent to which activities now being carried out by banks are prohibited by law.  Going back to something like the situation that arose before 2008, it was quite clear from the analysis the commission carried out that there were two issues there.  One was that the regulator was operating under what was called a principles approach to regulation, which was in effect light-touch regulation.  Furthermore, the resources the Central Bank had were very limited in terms of being able even to use the powers it did have.  Those are certain matters regarding whether the system is effective, the resourcing of that system and the capacity to implement those powers in practice.<\/p><p> From that point of view, regarding the effectiveness of the reforms that have already been enacted and the proposals being made to fill the gaps in regulators' powers, I appreciate that many people were very unhappy about the length of time it has taken to address the tracker mortgage scandal, for example.  Equally, however, the Central Bank could not have put in place the examination it did put in place or the requirement to enter into a tracker mortgage redress scheme for consumers and to pay them back the money that had been taken from them if the Central Bank was just going into banks and telling them that morally, they should pay the money back.  The Central Bank had to be able to tell them that breaches of the legislation had occurred, that offences had potentially been committed and that if they did not pay the money back, other powers could be used.  In this context, those regulatory powers have been applied and put into place.  The question is the extent to which there should be individual accountability in terms of criminal prosecutions.  This is of course very important but we now have examples, which we never had in the past, of situations in which very senior people, including chief executive officers, have been prosecuted and convicted.  The cost of these prosecutions is very high.  By comparison, I think the international literature points to the role of the regulatory powers and the presence of a very clearly well-resourced financial regulator now in the Central Bank, including the proposals the Central Bank itself has made regarding the senior manager accountability offence that it proposed in its report last year.  Again, we do not address that in our report because the Central Bank had already made that proposal.  All those different elements of that jigsaw, including what we would see as the need to tidy up the issue of corporate and senior manager liability as a general principle, are very important from a preventative point of view.  They might not guarantee that the kind of collapse that occurred previously would not happen.  Regarding resourcing and the granting of effective powers, however, the literature the commission has looked at internationally shows that those kinds of powers, such as financial sanctions and the ability to require regulatory settlements to be entered into, are extremely important and quite effective and, from a citizen's point of view, possibly the most efficient methods of ensuring-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Really.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#R00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>-----that redress is actually given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Mr. Byrne thinks financial sanctions are adequate to prevent this from happening again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#R00400","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>We are also saying that that is one part of the puzzle.

In its 2005 report the commission certainly recommended that this could be used.  To complement that, one would look at the kind of approach that was taken in the tracker mortgage instance where, in effect, one had the regulator imposing results for a very large group of people.  That might very well have been done through a class action.  I do not want to denigrate in any way a class action but these are very complex pieces of litigation to put together.  I would not say that class actions are not part of that overall measure but it was dealt with by the commission in a separate report.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide whether or not to implement that.  I am conscious there is a Private Members' Bill proposing that.

When there is a large fine - even if it is &euro;10 million, although I do not think there has yet been such a fine - nobody in the street knows about it, but one would certainly know if one's bank was closed for one or two weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#T00600","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>There was such a provision in the Intoxicating Liquor Act which I think is still in place.

They can include the consumer redress schemes that we saw with the tracker mortgage scandal.  They can also include situations where a requirement would be imposed on the entity, including the senior managers, to engage in reformed procedures to ensure what has been identified as a problem is, as far as possible, not repeated in the future.  The regulators have that capacity.  We recommend that the full range of that capacity should be explored by a regulator in deciding if an entity is capable of being rescued in the sense of being able to comply.  The regulator should be able to oversee various steps and ensure that they are implemented in the future to fix the problem.

In our work on this committee, we often come face to face with the failure of that law and we wonder why and how we can improve the law that we have.  The work of the commission is very important because it informs us and so on.  This exchange is the opportunity for us to test the layman's view of this against the commission and its view of the law.<\/p><p>Senator Paddy Burke raised a point regarding Jonathan Sugarman.  We can mention his name because it has been publicly aired here.  He abided by the law and said that he was obliged to tell the Central Bank, which he did.  Had he been listened to, we might have had a different outcome.  We cannot say that we would have, but we might have.  The biggest law that was broken was that approximately &euro;65 billion of taxpayers' money had to be put in to rescue the banks.  Arising from that, many people of the country were forced into poverty and legal exchanges with the banks to save their properties, which they thought they would never have to do.  We will not get specifically into Jonathan Sugarman's case but when we pursued the Central Bank about it, it said that, by law, it could not tell us what actually happened, if anything, to the complaint made by Jonathan Sugarman.  I would say one measure should be to take that law and change it.  The Central Bank should be allowed to name and shame in the context of the outcome of a complaint process against the bank.  That is the first thing and I think it is simple.  It is perhaps will not be so simple when the witnesses get at it but it is simple enough from a layman's perspective and gives transparency.<\/p><p>The law states that once the Garda has an investigation, this House cannot discuss the particulars of that investigation.  It may be an investigation about how public money was spent.<\/p><p>All an agency, a Government Department, the HSE or whatever has to do if it has been accused, and an investigation is undertaken here, is inform the Garda.  Once that is done, game over, we cannot pursue our work.  The law has to be changed in respect of giving the public information about issues relative to investigations or the investigations themselves.  There is a need to give some sort of comfort to the people involved that the investigations are ongoing, we know about them, we are conducting them and there will be an outcome.  One issue that was being dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts has gone on for 15 years.  We are told it is being investigated but I have no idea whether it is.  That is unfair.  They say it is because the law prevents them from telling people anything.  This all feeds into the public perception of the mainstays of the State such as the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the Garda.  It is creating a difficulty and respect is being damaged.  I am suggesting that these minor things might change it.<\/p><p> I refer also to accountants and their profession.  Their titles are displayed after their names and we can see if they are members of certain organisations.  This information is displayed to give them some standing and show they are okay.  It is the same with solicitors and barristers.  They are members of groups that give them a particular standing and give comfort to the client.  However, it sometimes happens that the legal representative and the accountant come together with a client, who relies solely on them, and go to the bank manager to ask for a loan, whereby they misrepresent the figures in order to attain the biggest loan possible.  The customer then complains to these organisations for barristers, solicitors or accountants and nothing ever happens.  A great number of farmers are now saying to us they wanted to get &euro;500,000 for a milking parlour or whatever and put forward the cost of a litre of milk at 29 cent, say.  The accountant told them that would not work and suggested that using a figure of 35 cent or 40 cent per litre might get them their &euro;500,000.  That is not a victimless crime; the victim is the client applying for the money.  I cannot understand why no one is held to account when that is exposed.  There must be a law somewhere that needs to be tightened or updated.<\/p><p> It is the same as what Deputy Pearse Doherty said about the tracker mortgages.  The banks must think we are all really naive to believe that on the same day in every bank, the decision was made about trackers and that it was just coincidence.  Whatever laws are controlling all of this have to be modernised in recognition of the fact that people are given an incentive to give out money, ignore real figures and be dishonest, knowing full well they will all get paid while the customer, who is the victim at the end of it, will have to carry the can.  Is there not a way of looking at all of these laws, not in isolation, in respect of how they impact on the perception of the general public?  We should examine how they can be tightened and modernised for our times.  A lot of what happened in the banking crisis is beginning to happen again and no one seems to mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#W00500","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The Chairman has asked us to address some very big questions there.

We are very clear.  There may well be deficiencies in regulation.  We are very conscious that in the lead-up to the banking crash there were issues around poor regulation and poor internal governance in banks.  They have already been identified, including in the banking inquiry.  We would not in any way be complacent about regulation.  I refer also to the proposal on deferred prosecution agreements.  In the United States, these can be done privately; in effect, a deal is done privately with a district attorney there.  We think that is unacceptable.

We should not be afraid to go there.  I accept the separation of powers, but if we cannot exchange views between one another on how powers might be operated better for the people whom we represent, how can we make the law better?  I do not mean exchanging views in an open public forum where we challenge each other, but perhaps the Law Reform Commission is the body to consider how we should do our work or what laws need to be changed.  I would welcome it doing so.<\/p> <p>  My final point concerns those who regulate their own profession such as solicitors, barristers, accountants, the regulator of banks or any other regulator.  Regardless of what happened in 2008 and the resources and legal framework with which they had to work, it would not have cost the regulators one cent to put up their hands and say, \"Stop, there is something wrong here,\" but they did not do so.  As I have seen, nobody is penalised.  That is what is sad about the laws of the country.  Our constituents tell us that the law applies to them but that it does not apply to those on high, the elite, as they might describe them.  I would like to see a lot more done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Protected disclosures were mentioned.  The protected disclosure legislation is great, but is it not amazing that in most cases an individual whistleblower will tell us that he or she is sorry that he or she came forward?

I would like to hear their views on two issues.  There was an interesting discussion on the banks and banking licences.  We know that a licence can be revoked, but the reality is that some banks are too big to fail.  Therefore, the consequences of revoking a bank's licence in the morning would be calamitous for customers and everyone else.  I was interested in what Mr. Tom O'Malley had to say about penalties other than financial penalties.  In the United States there is a special prosecutor who investigates large-scale cases.  Is there a need to have here a special prosecutor or for a regime of that nature to deal with potential future financial scandals or white collar crime?  Should we focus on that issue?<\/p> <p>  The Chairman spoke about whistleblowers and referred to Jonathan Sugarman.  We have raised this issue on numerous occasions at this committee.  On the tracker mortgage scandal, it is a source of frustration that cases will probably end up in court.  Whatever about the procedures of the Central Bank of Ireland and the number of people who have received redress under its direction, I received figures yesterday which showed the cases of 1,200 people who had gone through the system were with the Ombudsman as they felt they had been failed by the regime the Central Bank had put together with individual banks.  I have no doubt that when the Ombudsman has completed the investigations, a number of the people mentioned will go to court.  We are familiar with cases in which Bank of Ireland employees were completely shafted by the bank which employed them and left high and dry by the regulator and the Central Bank.  A class action is important.<\/p><p>In terms of accountability, I have always been of the view that unless one gets whistleblowers from the financial institution, where somebody speaks up, it is very difficult to prosecute.  Has the Law Reform Commission considered, as part of the body of work it has done on whistleblowing, the whistleblower reward scheme that has been considered by Britain and is in place in America?  There have been some quite interesting results, particularly the high awards for whistleblowers who get paid a portion of the amount that is recovered by the financial institution.  Recently, a US whistleblower was awarded $30 million, which gives an idea of the amount recovered on that information.  Quite recently another whistleblower refused the $8.5 million that was awarded to that individual from the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and asked instead that the money would be given to the shareholders of the financial institutions.  It is not always the case that the incentive is the reason to do it, but in that case, the individual stated that while the incentive was one reasons for coming forward, that person believed the sanction was still too light.  I am sorry for going off on a tangent.  In the witnesses' view, is there a role for such a whistleblower reward scheme to be introduced in respect of financial criminality and inappropriate financial conduct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#Z00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Deputy Pearse Doherty's first question was about the special prosecutor.  We certainly discussed the question of the allocation of prosecution functions when we were drawing up the report.  In America, for example, they have the concept of the special prosecutor, usually however in a more political context, such as when a senior politician, including perhaps the President, is under investigation.  When it comes to white-collar and corporate crime, generally speaking they would not necessarily have special prosecutors but they do have prosecutors who are specialised in the field.  Let me give an example, a great deal of white-collar and corporate crime is prosecuted in the southern district of New York, because that is where many of the major financial districts are located and therefore, both the prosecutors and the judges who operate in that particular area have tremendous expertise in areas such as insider trading and areas that are very complicated and so forth.<\/p> <p>  One of the things we have to realise when considering translating that into this country, is that the real problem is not so much a question of prosecution; it is very often the question of investigation, in that the investigation of these offences takes time, as we saw with the banking cases, for example.  The enormous amount of documentation that will be assembled as a result of those investigations could run to millions of pages of documents and will take time either way.  Therefore what I would suggest - I think this is accepted fully by all the law enforcement agencies in this country - is that one needs specialisation in the field.  I think under the Constitution it is possible to have a prosecutor other than the Director of Public Prosecutions and Article 30 of the Constitution would provide for that.  Given the scale with which we are operating and given that the number of large-scale offences of this nature that must be prosecuted probably will be rather small - I hope I am not being too optimistic - I think it is far better to stay with the Director of Public Prosecutions because that office has an enormous amount of expertise right across the board.  What experience has shown is that while it is all very well sometimes to talk about appointing special prosecutors, it is a very specialised area in itself and one does need experienced people.  Therefore the better idea at present is to leave the prosecution of serious offences within the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is a specialised section within that office to deal with this area but it may need further resources as time goes by in order to deal with more of those offences. <\/p> <p>  In respect of the Deputy's second question, the idea of rewarding people for being whistleblowers, is not one we had thought about in the course of our deliberations.  It is obviously something, as members can appreciate, that must be treated with great care to ensure it does not give rise to other issues.<\/p><p>When one starts to give people big money for doing that kind of thing, the temptation to do wrong and to make false allegations and so on can be very strong.  I am talking off the top of my head in a personal capacity and certainly am not speaking on behalf of the commission but were there to be some reward, I would not have any moral objection to it.  I would, however, be anxious that the rewards would be kept modest and should not be at a level at which they would provide the temptation to engage in what might be false allegations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Perhaps the better step would be to protect the whistleblower to a far greater extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#BB00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551139200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1551139200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019022600002#BB00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551139200,"counter":404,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 4.11 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Thursday, 7 March 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Standing Committee on the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands","time":1551139200,"counter":405},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 16:00<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 16:00<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Aindrias Moynihan, Joe O'Reilly, \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv,* Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile.

It is a gap that we are going to have to analyse over the next period in terms of the real demand for particular specialties.  The question the Chair asked is very valid on how many social workers we need in those areas.  It is not just a question of Galway, on which Mr. Mac Aodha Bhu&iacute; focused.

It is a very insightful question because it speaks to the difficulties we have had with the Irish language.  Mr. &Oacute; Coile&aacute;in has correctly spoken to the difficulty that has existed, which is that there has not been an Irish language strategy in the health services.  This is the first proper Irish language strategy for the health services.  It has to take in all of these concerns and join up different parts, including health business services, HBS, which is the body that looks after recruitment in the HSE.  We still have to identify the needs and gaps upon which we have all touched.  It is more advanced in the western Gaeltacht than in other Gaeltachts.  That is not to say that others such as Mr. &Oacute; Coile&aacute;in and Ms U&iacute; Theighne&aacute;in have not been doing their best to fill those gaps.  We have to analyse and see what exactly are the demands for the delivery of services through Irish.  We have to look at whether the demographic is growing or reducing as per the population.  We have to fill those gaps and that needs to be done systematically, working with HBS.  That is part of the strategy over the next five years.

As the committee will know, we are already involved with the GPs, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, as part of the GP contract negotiations.  That will form part of the discussion in that regard.

We looked at all of the work that they were doing.  We decided then to target all of our resources to where they would have the most impact.  The strategy is as a result of all of that work.<\/p> <p>  Previously, our team was working to regional managers, almost individually.  This is the first time we have a national team together under one manager and under one budget led by Mr. Mac Aodha Bhu&iacute; and reporting to myself and Mr. Connors, who is on the national HSE leadership team.  That is a big step forward.  It means that there is much more visibility for the language.  We will get buy-in for what we are doing.  The strategy has been approved at the highest level in the HSE.  We are at that starting point now and we will keep engaging with the public as we go on with this.  As we have said a number of times here today, it is a first step in a process and it is an advance on the previous stage.<\/p> <p>  There was an attempt in 2015 to do a new scheme but that coincided with the introduction of the hospital groups and the community healthcare organisations.
