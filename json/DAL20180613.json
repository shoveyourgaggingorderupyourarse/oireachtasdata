Every case is unique.  There will be some cases where voluntary care is the most appropriate response and others where it will be necessary to have a more formal arrangement using a court order under the Child Care Act 1991.<\/p>  <p>  Voluntary care is an important option open to Tusla and may be used to help struggling parents and protect vulnerable children.  Voluntary care is also utilised where parents require some form of short-term respite, or where a parent may be ill or seeking treatment for a particular condition.  Its application in these circumstances is particularly useful.  Approximately one third of children in care at any one time are cared for under a voluntary arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that voluntary care is based on parental consent.  The child's parent or guardian is entitled to have an input into the care that their child receives and they have the power to withdraw their consent if they are not satisfied with the care their child is receiving.  Important, it also makes it easier for struggling parents to entrust the care of their children to Tusla when they need help.  Voluntary care can facilitate a co-operative relationship between parents, Tusla, and caregivers, and this can be positive for the child and their family. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla introduced new practice guidance last year on the use of voluntary consent for admission to care.  This provides social workers with clear definitions of voluntary consent and the process for determining capacity to give consent.  Timely and understandable informed consent sets the stage for social work services and assists with providing all involved with an understanding of the process and associated realistic expectations.  The guidance also stresses that consent to a voluntary arrangement should only be sought if it is fair and proportionate in all circumstances, which is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300003#A00700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>As of January 2018, 32% of all children in care were placed under a voluntary care order.

It should only be sought if it is clear that reunification with the child's parents or guardians is possible.<\/p>  <p>  Under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, we made a commitment to review and reform the Child Care Act 1991.  My Department has initiated that work and engaged with Tusla and other State agencies.

The cases were identified during an analysis of adoption records that were transferred to Tusla by the former adoption society, St. Patrick's Guild.  As the information that an incorrect birth registration has taken place is life changing, the State has a responsibility to reach a high level of certainty that this has happened before it contacts the individuals concerned.  This threshold has been reached in the case of the 126 St. Patrick's Guild files.<\/p><p>We are all aware of the seriousness and sensitivity of this issue.  People have the right to their identities.  They have the right to know of their true origins and, where we have clear evidence, we have an obligation to tell those affected.  Some may know, but for others, it will be entirely new and difficult information to receive and absorb.<\/p><p>There will be a social worker-led process of making contact with those affected who can be identified.  This includes the birth mother, the person who was incorrectly registered - the child - and the people who participated in the incorrect registrations and subsequently raised these children as their own.  Each of the 126 cases has been assigned to an experienced Tusla information and tracing social worker and work has commenced on tracing the individuals concerned.<\/p><p>  I emphasise that the process will be measured, sensitive and carried out at the pace of the individual affected.  There will be no sudden phone calls or unannounced visits to people's doors.  The process of offering contact and supporting those affected will be handled carefully and take account of the requirements of the individuals.<\/p><p>I am confident that Tusla is prioritising these cases and committing the necessary resources.  However, I reiterate that the only information available at the commencement of the process was contained in records that were in most cases more than 50 years old.

If this marker had not been present, it would have been difficult to identify even the 126 cases.

It is something they realise only during the course of their pregnancies or, in the case of some people to whom I have spoken, only when they have turned up to register the birth of a child.  All of sudden, they realise that the form has a space for &quot;mother&quot; and a space for &quot;father&quot; and that one cannot simply cross out &quot;father&quot; and have two mothers.  I was contacted by Leanne when she and her partner, Nile, to whom she is married, needed to get a passport for their baby.  Eventually, they had no choice but to put just one of the parents' names on the birth certificate.  They were not able to register both as parents.  That has an ongoing impact and as time goes on, it will present real difficulties.  Leanne sent me the following:<\/p><blockquote>Nile and I created our baby together.  We went through the process that every couple do with the intent of creating a human.  I willingly signed up to love and care for someone for the rest of my life.  Is this not what makes a family?<br \/><br \/>This month we celebrate gay pride.  The theme is &quot;We Are Family&quot;.  How much of a slap in the face is this to all same sex parents out there?  Instead of celebrating our first pride as a family, we'll be marching and protesting for our rights.  Again.<br \/><br \/>I hope all my friends and family will join us.

Many of these people are my friends and I am concerned as much about those who have been couples with children for years as I am about those who are about to have children.

Unfortunately, a lot of people out there have been asking questions and been told over a long period that commencement was about to start, albeit some issues were identified.  The Minister will therefore forgive a certain scepticism or wariness until we see what the plan is.  While I accept there are real technical difficulties, it is vital that the Government takes whatever steps are necessary to put this in place given the passage of three years since elected representatives in the House passed the Act following the endorsement by the people of marriage equality.

This was prior to the marriage equality referendum and it was called \"The Voices of Children - Report on Initial Research with Children of LGBT Parents\", published in 2010 by Marriage Equality, an organisation I helped to found.  It is a terrific document still and it describes how children felt at not being acknowledged and recognised as families.  Having said that and having consulted with the people to whom the Deputy is also speaking, including those who have written to me and a number of my friends, it may be useful to do some additional research on children's perspectives as the children of LGBT parents and on the impact it has on them.

In that regard, I understand that methodological matters are currently being finalised.  Given the volume of records involved, we must first judge the likely incidence of cases that can actually be identified through this analysis.  I will then be in a position to judge the next steps.  Records which are not in the custody of either Tusla or the Adoption Authority cannot be included in the analysis at this stage as the State does not have possession of them.  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 is the statutory mechanism necessary to bring these records, estimated at about 50,000, into the custody of the Adoption Authority.  I am meeting colleagues from both Houses this afternoon to explore how we can progress this legislation as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The extent to which children were simply placed with couples and their births registered as if they had been born to them is but one of the major issues that we need to examine.

One of the reasons for this, apart from the fact that trawling through 100,000 records will be a significant and labour intensive job, is that from a research perspective we should take this one step at a time to see if the methodology being developed will work to help us uncover evidence of the illegal registrations.

People like her, with few resources but with an open heart and a will to find answers through DNA testing and so on, have been able to give people answers when they were told there was no information to be had in other quarters.  We need to tap into resources such as DNA.  Mandatory counselling should be provided to support people in this process and a method to reach out to affected people and those who will be affected must be put in place early on in the process.  We should not wait for that.  It requires not just urgency; it requires a beefing up of resources in those areas as well as in record searching and in extending the scope.

If that is the case, engagement with stakeholders could be critical.  At the meeting I held with stakeholders - and the Deputy will be aware of this because she has also spoken with them - a number of related issues and concerns were raised such as falsified addresses and dates of birth by birth mothers, the importance of baptismal records, the use of obviously false addresses on records and the potential to identify trends.

The Government is committed to supporting parents in caring for young children at home in a range of ways.  Within the remit of my Department, a number of schemes provide support to parents whether they work full time, part time, or stay at home.  For example, from September of 2018 all children aged from two years and eight months will be entitled to access two years of free pre-school through the Early Childhood and Education, ECCE, programme.  Some 114,000 children are expected to benefit this September, many of whom will be children of stay-at-home parents.  The current targeted childcare schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments or medical cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents.  A universal childcare subsidy is available to all parents of children under three, regardless of whether parents are working or not.  The affordable childcare scheme, ACS, which is under development will make childcare subsidies available on the basis of family income and will be available to stay-at-home parents.  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents.  A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per month is available to all children.  Budget 2018 increased the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,200 per year.  There has also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years.  Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016.  In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.  Currently, my Department is also drafting a cross-Government early years strategy.  The strategy will include a range of measures to support families given the fundamental importance they play in shaping children&rsquo;s outcomes.  I look forward to updating the House on those developments later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300010#H01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1528886100,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

All proposals are expected to have a strong professional development and-or coaching and mentoring component.<\/p>  <p>  Four applications were made from County Kildare: For&oacute;ige - the Strengthening Families programme for Kildare\u00a0and west Wicklow; County Kildare Leader\u00a0partnership - Mojo project to support young men; Kildare Youth Services and Curragh and Newbridge Garda youth diversion project; and Kilcullen community childcare\u00a0and education centre - breakfast and afterschool service expansion.<\/p>  <p>  Each individual application\u00a0has been\u00a0assessed against the transparent criteria outlined in the guidance document.  The outcome of each application will depend on the quality and proposed impact of the initiative outlined in the application form, the ability of the measure to support diverse innovations across a range of community, contexts and practice areas and the number of quality proposals received.  All the applications received under this funding measure have been\u00a0assessed by an expert evaluation panel assigned by the Department.  Our aim is to notify applicants\u00a0by the end of this month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300011#J00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1528886700,"counter":106,"content":"<p>The Minister outlined the four applications from County Kildare and I will briefly touch on them.

It works and we must be able to extend it and provide it in other locations.<\/p>  <p>  The application from the Kildare Leader programme is for the Mojo project.  Young men aged between 18 and 24 are getting involved in it with an open mind as it does not have the stigma attaching to HSE-run projects.

One of the principal goals of the 2018 early years and school age capital programmes, as in previous years, has been to assist childcare providers in creating new additional places where demand for those exists.  The decisions in respect of the 2018 capital funding programmes were delivered to providers on 1 June, following a thorough and impartial appraisal process overseen by my Department.  A total of 398 individual services throughout the country have been offered funding as a result, to a total value of &euro;6.87 million.  A total of &euro;3.87 million of that amount has been allocated for the creation of new early years places in 85 separate projects.  This funding will result in the creation of a total of 1,950 new places nationwide - 697 of which will be for zero to three year-olds, and 1,253 of which will ECCE places.  In addition, &euro;750,000 has\u00a0been allocated for the creation of new school age childcare places in 45 separate projects.  This funding will result in the creation of 807 new places in school age services.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 capital programmes\u00a0generated\u00a0extraordinary demand within the sector.  As a result, only applications of the highest quality were successful on this occasion.  However, services that narrowly missed out on funding have been added to a short capital reserve list.  Those will be considered for funding in the event that any of the successful applicants are not in a position to use their funding.  I am pleased at the level of interest in developing early years and school age places.  I would like to continue this type of capital funding in 2019 and beyond, in order that we meet the demand for places in the coming years.  I will carefully consider the level and quality of sectoral demand for all strands of funding, as well as all constructive feedback on this year's programmes in the development of capital funding for 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300011#J00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1528886700,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply and I welcome the recent grant approvals.

As Members may be aware, Standing Order 59 deals with matters that are <i>sub judice<\/i>.  This is drafted in such as way as to protect the ability of Members to discuss issues of general public importance, even in circumstances where there are proceedings before a judicial tribunal.  However, in paragraph 3 it clearly stipulates that &quot;a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the D&aacute;il to encroach on the functions of the Courts or a Judicial Tribunal&quot;.  It also places an onus on Members to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might, in effect, prejudice the outcome of proceedings.<\/p><p>My predecessors have ruled on this issue previously and in certain circumstances have allowed very limited discussions on matters of public importance, which were being examined by judicial tribunals.  In applying Standing Order 59, a delicate balance is to be achieved between, on the one hand, a matter of general public importance to be raised, and on the other ensuring that there is no overt encroachment on the work of a judicial body.  It is a balancing exercise that must be conducted on a case-by-case basis, which respects the role of parliamentarians to discuss matters of general public importance, the rights of persons appearing before a tribunal to a fair hearing and the ability of a tribunal to complete its work expeditiously and in accordance with due process.

He was a very popular Member of these Houses and a legend in GAA administration.  He was chairman of the Limerick county board, and this could be Limerick's year in many ways; the team is doing very well so far.  Mr. Kiely was enjoying the hurling this summer.  He was also a former chairman of the Munster council.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.  We will have an opportunity at a later stage to give longer tributes.  <\/p>  <p>  The Irish public has been genuinely shocked at the CervicalCheck scandal and the treatment of the women at its heart, in terms of non-disclosure in particular, which has resulted in women being forced through the courts.  Without the bravery of Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and others we may never have known the full extent of what transpired.  The drip-drip release of information from the Department of Health, the HSE and CervicalCheck via the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Health compounded that sense of shock and anger.  Promises were made, perhaps in haste, in terms of a redress scheme that has not fully been realised, support packages, and mediation which would avoid the necessity of people going to court.  We learned this morning that a fourth very ill woman is in court at the moment on this very issue.  We were also promised a scoping inquiry that would conclude at the end of June.  The progress report produced by Dr. Gabriel Scally will add to that anger and frustration, particularly regarding the manner in which documentation was released by the various bodies, namely, the Department of Health, the HSE and CervicalCheck.  More than 4,000 documents were released over two days between 6 June and 8 June and documentation was provided in a format that was essentially unsearchable according to Dr. Scally.  He stated it was disappointing and unclear why documents that originally were prepared in electronic format were not available to the inquiry in that format.  <\/p>  <p>  Those factors will add to the anger and sense of shock that people feel already about this issue.  It should be remembered that the Minister himself was only told about the Vicky Phelan case very late in the day.  Indeed, we learned about the substantive and intensive negotiations and discussions between all the bodies for over two years on this issue.  There is a discernible pattern in this regard.  Dr. Scally is now saying that he will conclude his report by the end of the summer.  I have doubts as to whether he will, given the terms of reference and the amount of work he has to do.  The D&aacute;il is adjourning on 12 July, which I do not agree with.  I believe we should consider whether that is the best course of action.  Will the Taoiseach consider cutting to the chase by rolling the Scally inquiry into a commission of investigation?<\/p><p>At the current rate of progress, we are looking at a commission of investigation starting in November if we are lucky.  Putting Dr. Scally and his team on a statutory basis in the form of a commission of investigation might be the most effective way to give teeth to the investigation and to ensure there is no more messing, no more withholding of documentation and no more of the kind of stuff that has gone on so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300012#K00600","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528887900,"counter":119,"content":"<p>This is a difficult and emotive issue and has caused concern throughout the country, not just among people who have been affected and their families, but among women in general, and women, in particular, who avail of cervical screening.  I believe the Government has taken a lot actions in a swift manner.  We established a serious incident management team to go into CervicalCheck and deal with the issues there.  We established a scoping inquiry, asked Dr. Scally to do his work, and secured agreement on a cross-party basis for the terms of reference of the inquiry.  We secured agreement with doctors to enable women to have a free visit to their GP and a repeat smear test if they felt that was necessary or wanted that done for reassurance.  We have appointed a team comprising members of the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.  This team is going back over all of the old slides and smear tests of the women affected to make sure they are quality assured and to find out if abnormalities were missed and if there were abnormalities that should not have been missed.<\/p>  <p>  We have also put in place a package of practical supports for women and their families, extending from medical cards to access to experimental medicines, assistance with childcare and so on.  Delivery of that is still under way, and in each case it is a tailored package.  Public health nurses and others have met individually with women and their families to discuss with them what type of supports they want.  Because the supports are individual and tailored, it is taking time to put them in place, but that is very much under way.  In addition, we have accepted Dr. Scally's recommendation for a payment to be made to women right away to cover some of their expenses arising from dealing with his inquiry.  We have also confirmed the Government's decision to move to a more modern form of cervical screening using human papillomavirus, HPV, as the primary test.  That was planned anyway, but we are going to press ahead and become one of the first countries in the western world to do it.  <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally was appointed by the Government to do this work, and the terms of reference were agreed by the Oireachtas.  Should it be the case that anyone obstructs the work of Dr. Scally, they will also be obstructing the Government.  I want to make it very clear to any agency or public body, if it is not already, that we expect full co-operation with Dr. Scally and his team and will accept nothing less than that.  The Minister for Health met Dr. Scally in recent days to assure him that if he runs into any further issues, he has a direct line to the Minister to deal with them.  I note from yesterday's statement that while he expressed enormous frustration with the speed at which he received documentation and the format it came in, he said he was broadly content with the interaction he was having.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's suggestion of rolling this into a commission of inquiry, we would have to give that proper consideration.  One of the advantages of having a scoping inquiry is that even though it was only set up a few weeks ago, we already have a progress report, an interim report and findings and recommendations related to one of the terms of reference.  Those recommendations are in the process of being implemented.  While it is intended to have a commission of investigation once Dr. Scally has finished his work, it is important to bear in mind the consequences of such a commission.  If we had set up a commission of investigation set up, we would not have had that progress.  We would probably find that the investigation would run much more slowly and that, because of the statutory nature, everyone would have a lawyer.  We have found on a number of occasions that it takes months to set commissions of inquiry up and a year or two years before they complete their work and produce findings and recommendations.  The point of the Scally inquiry was to have initial an scoping inquiry to quickly find out as much as we could and do as much as we could before a commission was set up, because that will probably take more than a year if not two or three, as they always do.  Many women, unfortunately and sadly, do not have that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300013#L00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1528887900,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Martin, I wish to point out to leaders that Standing Orders set out that there is a definite time allowed for all these items.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300013#L00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1528887900,"counter":121,"content":"<p>There is also a time at which to be here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300013#L00400","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1528887900,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Yesterday, we exceeded the allocated time in every section.

The Taoiseach's own Minister did not know what was going on about this issue because he had not been told.  The Committee of Public Accounts had to drag fairly basic documentation out of the Department and the HSE.  Officials had been discussing this for two years, yet information could not be made available to the Oireachtas or the Minister until the committee forced it out of them.  We now have 4,000 documents that were sent over two days in an unsearchable format.  Does that not ring alarm bells?

It is appropriate that we allow him that time, particularly because he wants to engage individually with more of the women affected and their families.  Of course that is going to take a bit of time.  I have not spoken to him personally, but Dr. Scally has said to the Government that he believes that he can finish this work by the end of the summer.  We should allow him to do that.  This is a scoping inquiry, which will get to a lot of the facts and make a lot of recommendations, which we can then implement immediately.  We will then move on to the commission of investigation.  Even if we were now to decide to fold the work into a commission of investigation, we would still need a scoping exercise anyway.

Paragraph 46 of the December joint report states the agreement is \"made and must be upheld in all circumstances, irrespective of the nature of any future agreement between the European Union and United Kingdom.\"<\/p>  <p>  Paragraph 49 states that while it is Britain's intention to achieve these objectives through an overall relationship with the EU, which every Member will support, the UK will propose \"specific solutions to address the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland\" - or a backstop - should this not be possible.  If there was no agreement between Britain and the European Union on trade, there was some certainty for businesses on either side of the Border and for the people in Ireland that there would be as much alignment as possible with the rules of the customs union and Single Market.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's cast-iron guarantee is in tatters.  A paper was published by the British Government a couple of days ago which essentially took the backstop off the table and turned it into a UK-wide extension of the implementation period.

We have an extraordinary situation where we had something on the table that was a real and tangible political agreement, but that has been turned into something entirely different because of internal wrangling in the Tory party.  We have to hold the Taoiseach to account, and the best way to do so is the promises he makes and the benchmarks he sets.  He said this was cast iron.

We are in a very difficult place, however.  What will be the Government's approach at the June summit?

In December, a political agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union that gives us a number of guarantees and assurances - for example, on the common travel area, for ongoing PEACE funding for Northern Ireland and Border areas and with regard to citizens' rights - was reached.  I do not think anyone is doubting these at present.  They are all very much cast-iron guaranteed.  I also used the term \"bulletproof\" regarding commitments on the Border.  In addition, I said it was the end of the beginning and not the beginning of the end, that we needed to be vigilant and that we had to insist that the guarantees we were given were written into the withdrawal agreement.  That is where matters stand.<\/p>  <p>  In March, the European Union - all 27 member states together backed by the EU institutions - produced a draft text of the withdrawal agreement, including a protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland, that put in legal form everything we achieved and secured in December.  Last week, the United Kingdom Government produced a paper which represents a small step in the right direction but which I do not believe to be adequate.  It is at very best a partial solution to part of the problem.  It deals with customs, which is welcome, but not with regulatory alignment, which is essential to avoiding a hard border.  In many cases, perhaps not all, regulatory alignment will be required.  Even though it is not in the written text of the UK's amendment, it seems to imply that there would be an expiry date sometime in 2021.  This is not something we can accept.  The whole point of a backstop is that it implies it will exist unless and until there is a new treaty between the EU and the UK that makes it unnecessary.  That is where we need further movement and concessions from the UK Government between now and the forthcoming summit.  If we do not get it then, quite frankly, nobody will be able to say that sufficient progress has been made.  We will need to intensify the negotiations in the months ahead to ensure that happens.  What the European Union is very firm on is that we are not going to be in a position to discuss long-term issues, such as the new trading relationship and the new arrangements that will exist between the UK and EU, until such time as the withdrawal agreement and the backstop are agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300014#M00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1528888500,"counter":128,"content":"<p>The problem is that we have no legal framework.

The reality is - I think this is genuinely lost on the Taoiseach - that the British Government has essentially taken the cast-iron guarantee off the table.  In the paper it has written the British Government has restructured matters in order to write the North out of the script and turn what is a backstop or permanent solution in the event of no deal into an extension of the negotiating period.

We have to hold Taoiseach to account and the way to do so in the context of this issue is to encourage him to hold the British Government to account and to ensure that the latter does not resile on commitments it gave in December.  The Taoiseach and his European Union counterparts do this at the forthcoming summit.  While the Taoiseach says that this will happen, what real and substantial progress needs to be made - separate from what is in the paper published by the British Government - between now and the summit for him to be able to say that real and sufficient progress has been made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300014#M00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1528888500,"counter":129,"content":"<p>My priority is to secure the agreement and not to sell it.

Thankfully, we are not used to such events happening.  In the aftermath of what happened, I assisted other locals in organising a very large public meeting that was held in Cahersiveen.  It was attended by many public representatives and, very importantly, by our Garda superintendent, Flor Murphy, from Killarney Garda station and the local sergeant, Michael Murphy.  We appreciated very much their attendance because the locals want to work with the local garda&iacute;.  More than 500 people were at the meeting, which was a great testament to the concerns the locals have about the well-being of their area.  The area comprising Cahersiveen and south Kerry in general - including places such as Sneem, Castlecove, Caherdaniel, Waterville, Ballinskelligs, Portmagee, Valentia Island, Glenbeigh and Foilmore - is beautiful.  We want to protect it and make it as safe a place as it always has been for the people who live there and those who visit.  It is probably the most beautiful part not just of Ireland but of the western world and we want it to stay that way.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, as was identified at the meeting to which I refer, more resources are needed.  We had our own dedicated superintendent in the Garda station in question for many years.  We had more garda&iacute; available there for many years.  We had a second sergeant.  I welcome the fact the very able, capable and hard-working local sergeant will be assisted by another sergeant in the near future.  However, I want the second sergeant to be put in place as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Serious consideration should be given to putting a full-time superintendent back into south Kerry because the superintendent, Flor Murphy, has an amazing amount of work to do in the Killarney area due to the fact that it is so busy.  It is my humble opinion, and that of the locals, that having to cover south Kerry and Cahersiveen is too much of the workload for one person.  There is a great case to be made for putting a second superintendent back in the locality.  The people there deserve this.  On the night in question, 500 people turned up at the meeting.  I appreciate the fact that local garda&iacute; and the superintendent were present and answered all of the questions put to them.  The people want reassurance.  They want to ensure that their children will be safe.  I compliment the Garda because a number of raids have been carried out since the meeting took place and these have resulted in illegal drugs being found and confiscated.  We appreciate that very much.  In the past, we have been let down in the context of resources.  Garda&iacute; are doing excellent work but they need more assistance and more resources to be made available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300014#M00500","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1528888500,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I want to take a moment to add my words of condolence to the family of Rory Kiely, who passed away, and also to the family of Se&aacute;n Calleary, whom we lost last week.

There will be a time in the future when we will be able to give more lengthy tributes to those two men who gave great service to our country and our politics.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Michael Healy-Rae for raising this important issue, which I know is of great concern in south Kerry.  I agree with him that south Kerry is surely one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland and, indeed, the world.  I will long remember my days as Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport and being able to spend a lot of time in Kerry and experiencing the beauty of that particular county.<\/p><p> I am of course aware of the brutal murder of Mr. Robert Elston, who died after receiving serious stab wounds following an altercation in Cahersiveen on 23 May, and the Minister for Justice and Equality has briefed me on the matter.  I understand the Garda immediately mounted a full investigation that has led to an individual being charged and brought before the courts.  The Deputy will appreciate that as it is now a matter before the courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment much further on the matter.  However, this reprehensible act destroyed a family and has, understandably, left the community of Cahersiveen and wider south Kerry in complete shock.  I know the House will join me in extending our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr. Elston.  As the Deputy mentioned, a large public meeting took place in Cahersiveen on 5 June, with members of the community coming together to voice their concerns, particularly in light of recent events.  I understand members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were also in attendance to listen to the contributions.<\/p> <p> The Government remains committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources to tackle all forms of crime in our communities, including in south Kerry.  Approximately &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda for 2018, which will lead to investment in new equipment, whether it is information and communications technology, cars or other vehicles.  It also means we will have 600 more garda&iacute; than when this Government of Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independents came into office.  The manner in which those extra garda&iacute; are to be deployed is of course a matter for the Garda Commissioner and it is up to him to decide where superintendents, inspectors and garda&iacute; should be located.

That anniversary coincides with a visit from the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing, Ms Leilani Farha.  Ms Farha had one clear message, which is that Ireland is failing abysmally when it comes to housing.  The Taoiseach speaks of the republic of opportunities but this morning, the Ombudsman for Children speaks of thousands of children being denied the most basic opportunities.  The ombudsman described the position of almost 10,000 people in emergency accommodation, saying it was \"shameful\", which it is of course.<\/p>  <p>  There are no opportunities for those struggling to keep a roof over their head and there are certainly no opportunities for those with no roof over their head.  It is all about survival.  I have no doubt the Taoiseach will point to the Rebuilding Ireland report but Ms Farha clearly pointed out the lack of a coherent housing strategy.  The evidence of this has been stark and in the past four years alone, just 818 local authority were built, with 396 of those last year.  This happens because Fine Gael's ideology is to focus most of its efforts on the private market approach.<\/p>  <p>  A housing seminar hosted by the Simon Communities on Monday heard that, in total, the State had transferred over &euro;1 billion to private landlords in housing supports.  This is not a housing strategy but is a market-led approach designed to put the State at arm's distance from responsibility.  We have not enshrined the right to housing either constitutionally or legislatively.  It is not a far-fetched concept as 81 other countries have adopted the concept of a right to housing.  It does not mean that everyone could demand a house but rather that the State would be obliged to create strategies that would develop housing in a way that ensures affordable and accessible opportunities available to all.  It would change the narrative and the focus.  Instead of housing being viewed as a commodity, the Government would recommend housing first and foremost as a home.  This is not pie in the sky and Ms Farha is able to point to real working examples in countries and cities that have jumped on board with her recommendations.  Barcelona is foremost among these with the Barcelona manifesto.  Ms Farha has also worked in Portugal, which has implemented housing strategies that aim to eradicate homelessness by 2028.  Meanwhile, we are continuing a path that has proven not only to be ineffective but damaging.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that in the year since he took office, homelessness has worsened and housing has become increasingly inaccessible and unaffordable to both renters and potential purchasers?  Has the Taoiseach considered a constitutional or statutory obligation for housing that may be necessary to address what is an unprecedented housing crisis in the country?  Will he consider extending a formal State invitation to Ms Farha to visit in an official capacity and work with the Government to develop strategies that will prioritise the delivery of adequate and affordable housing for all?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300015#N00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1528889100,"counter":136,"content":"<p>It is a year tomorrow since my election as Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300015#N00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1528889100,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Where is the party?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300015#N00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1528889100,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I am not one for anniversaries or birthdays.

Part 4 of the Civil Liability Act 1961 sets out the procedure for fatal injuries actions taken by next of kin.  Such actions are taken to establish liability for a death that was caused wrongfully and, in some cases, to provide financially for the dependants of the deceased.<\/p><p>The law distinguishes between the measurable financial loss suffered by a dependant where the deceased was contributing to the income of the household, on the one hand, and compensation for mental distress resulting from the death of each family member on the other.  Compensation for mental distress, known as solatium, is capped by statutory instrument by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In 2014, that was capped at &euro;35,000.  However, where medical negligence in the provision of treatment to a pregnant woman results in the loss of her pregnancy, solatium is not available.  There is no compensation for a mother for mental distress on the loss of an unborn child.  She may recover damages only for any injury to her own health.  The other family members, including the father, are not regarded as having suffered any damage or loss.<\/p><p>According to section 49 of the Act, the law relating to civil wrongs applies to an unborn child for its protection in the same manner as if a child were born at the time, but only where the child is subsequently born alive.  A person can sue for injuries suffered as a result of wrongs done to him or her while in the womb or in the process of being born.  A person with cerebral palsy caused by difficulties in labour may recover damages under this rule but if those wrongs result instead in the death of the child, section 58 does not apply, nor does Part 4 of the Act.  One purpose of the Bill is to extend Part 4 to provide both recognition and a remedy where family members who suffer as a result of the loss of pregnancy caused negligently can have some recourse.<\/p><p>This is a simple Bill.  Where there is proven medical negligence, for instance, if a child is born with cerebral palsy, a personal injury claim can be made.  There have been many of those cases.  Where a child is born and dies subsequently, however, a fatal injury claim can be processed where there has been negligence.  What this small amending Bill will do is address the anomaly where there is proven medical negligence and the child is stillborn.  This is to allow the family to have access to modest compensation.  I propose &euro;75,000 in such circumstances.<\/p><p>I am bringing forward this legislation because of two people who are sitting in the Visitors Gallery, namely Derek and Mignon Underwood from Wexford, who approached me some time ago regarding their case.  In 2012, they lost their child, Conor, who was stillborn as a result of proven medical negligence.  It took them two years to fight their case.  The HSE admitted negligence.  It took another 21 months to deal with the matter.  We all know what we are talking about when it comes to the State Claims Agency.  It took 21 months, in a case where liability was admitted, for this issue to be dealt with.  In that scenario, it took four years of fighting.  In total, the family has been looking for justice following the loss of Conor for six years.<\/p><p>The Underwoods are not interested in this to obtain any form of compensation for themselves.  They went through the courts and won in the High Court.  It has been acknowledged that what happened to both of them was wrong and there was negligence.  The reason I am introducing this Bill, which we will call Conor's law, is to ensure that no family that finds itself in the unique circumstance I have described will ever have to go through what the Underwoods went through and fight the way they had to fight.<\/p><p> We must provide a legislative basis to deal with this anomaly in cases where medical negligence has been proven.  In that context, I ask the Government and other Opposition Deputies to support this short Bill.  Furthermore, I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could examine whether there is a mechanism whereby, through the Department of Justice and Equality, the Bill might be progressed in conjunction with other legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300019#R02400","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528892100,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892100,"counter":284,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892100,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S00500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528892100,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed)","time":1528892100,"counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Risk Assessment","time":1528892100,"counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S00750"},{"type":"question","time":1528892100,"counter":290,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[23590\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the main new risks identified in the 2018 draft national risk assessment compared with those in the 2017 assessment.

I would like to concentrate on one of the new risks that has been identified, namely, that of the economy overheating.  I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and we have discussed that matter at length.  I get a sense sometimes that economists who missed predicting the previous economic crash want to make sure they do not get caught out again and that they are getting ready to predict the next one.  As we ramp up our spending on construction significantly, there is no doubt there is a risk that this can have an impact in terms of overheating.  Will the Taoiseach indicate how much analysis has been done on the risk of not investing in the housing sector, where such investment is so badly needed, and in key infrastructure projects such as those outlined in Project Ireland 2040, including in respect of roads, hospitals and schools?  We have had the lost decade and we have to restore investment levels.  We will be taking a big risk if we do not make the necessary vital investment in key infrastructure in order to allow people to work and live well into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The economists to whom I refer also presume that we will continue the boom-to-bust cycle.  It would be a major risk if the spending decisions that are made have more to do with short-term spending strategies rather than key infrastructure projects.  We want to move away from that boom-to-bust cycle.  I would be concerned about commitments and promises from the Opposition.  We have examined Fianna F&aacute;il's proposals and discovered that they will cost &euro;1.5 billion for 2018 alone in terms of extra Government spending.  We must look to see how we can mitigate all these risks to stop us returning to the boom-to-bust cycle.  We do not want to return to the mistakes of the past, we want to ensure that we invest in key infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S01100","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892100,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Are Questions Nos. 1 and 2 grouped?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S01200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892100,"counter":295,"content":"<p>They are grouped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S01300","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892100,"counter":296,"content":"<p>The recently published draft national risk assessment is a comprehensive document.  We will not have time to discuss it at length but I would like to focus on one particular aspect, which rightly identifies the supply of housing as one of the most immediate domestic challenges facing the State.  Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledges that there is no easy-fix solution.  Unfortunately, we are dealing with legacy issues of past Fianna F&aacute;il Governments and the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government, which failed in terms of housing, and the absolute determination of the more conservative parties to stop building social housing and outsource it to the private sector.  The reality is that, by any yardstick, this Government has failed in the context of housing.  The Minister was asked about that earlier and he became very defensive when discussing the facts.  He might be able to throw figures out in terms of some modest improvements in home building but nobody can argue that the Government has not done anything near what is necessary in order to deal with the housing crisis.

The first is a general and quite political assessment drawn up under the supervision of Ministers and the second is a very focused and expert one drawn up by the emergency management services.  The striking thing about the risks identified in the general document is how often there is an attempt to say that everything is in hand or to avoid specifics.  For example, there is no proper quantification of fiscal risks and all we have to go upon are the anonymous briefings the Minister for Finance has been giving to journalists about how he is saving the nation from a reckless Opposition.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, surprisingly, the draft does not mention the impact of the current stated objective of the European Union in the negotiations.  Michel Barnier has stated that the European Union is offering a comprehensive free trade agreement but not continued membership of the customs union and the Single Market because these cannot be accommodated within the British red lines.  According to the Copenhagen study, this will represent a permanent loss of 4.3% of our GDP.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that according to the information available to him, the current offer of the European Union to the United Kingdom is in line with that and will therefore cost &euro;2,693 per person?  That is the impact using last year's figures so the impact will be bigger.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the other risk assessment by the Office of Emergency Planning, again, it is a clear representation of the threats.  It has been drawn up in line with the guidelines put in place by Deputy O'Dea over a decade ago and this format has been very effective to date.  Can the Taoiseach tell us if he has examined this risk assessment, which was completed last year, to ensure that sufficient resources are in place to meet the highest priority threats?  The overall emergency management plan created by Deputy O'Dea has been effective and the only change in recent times has been the increased prominence of politicians in press conferences.  Can the Taoiseach tell us what happened to the new emergency planning document?

It is a very broad canvas and it is difficult to ask specific questions on so many strategic issues.  We have other opportunities to deal with issues like Brexit and so on but I want to ask about two.  First, an area I am increasingly more concerned about relates to our commitments in regard to climate change, not only the physical impact - we have had two status red storms in Ireland during the past winter with very significant damage to us - but also because we will be subject to very serious fines due to not meeting our international commitments on greenhouse gas abatement.  We need to get serious about that now.  We have no prospect of meeting the targets unless we set out a clear strategy.  I am interested in the Taoiseach's views on how that matter is to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Second, external interference in our democratic process is an issue we raised yesterday but is one we should not let go off our agenda.  We need to have a robust mechanism to ensure that external forces do not manipulate any elections we have into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S01600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892100,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I will deal first Deputy Heydon's question on the very risk of overheating of our economy.  This is a very real risk but one which we should not over-exaggerate..<\/p><p>The enormous political challenge over the next couple of months, or perhaps the next year, is to break the cycle of boom and bust that we have had in Ireland for generations, the procyclical economic policies that slash taxes and increase welfare and spending when things are going well only to take it all away again when things are going badly.  We should do the reverse.  We should balance the books, start running a small surplus into the future and start paying down our debt so that when the economy slows down, as it inevitably will, or when there is another recession - that might be far away but it might happen - we will be in a position to increase spending and cut taxes, which is what should be done during a recession.  That was not possible in the past because of irresponsible economic policies and I am determined that it should not happen again.<\/p> <p> There were two features to the overheating that occurred previously.  There was a credit bubble, with excessive lending by the banks to the construction industry, in particular, and to people buying homes.  That does not appear to be the case currently.  I do not see evidence of a credit bubble.  Second, extra day-to-day spending was funded with windfall taxation from stamp duty.  It was a huge mistake by previous Governments to commit to extra current, ongoing spending across the board that was funded by a temporary windfall in taxation from stamp duty.  We must bear in mind the vulnerability of corporation tax receipts and not allow ourselves to repeat that mistake.  We are nowhere near that yet, but corporation tax revenues are buoyant and we should not make the mistake of using them, as they might not always be available, to fund long-term commitments.<\/p> <p> We should use the buoyant receipts from corporation tax for items such as investment in infrastructure, as Deputy Heydon mentioned.  He is spot-on in that regard.  We must increase infrastructure spending in transport, housing, schools, universities, healthcare facilities and climate change.  That makes both economic and social sense.  Our spending on public infrastructure is up 18% so far this year, and it will increase by another 25% next year.  We are tackling some deep social problems, for example, the social housing shortage and the general housing shortage.  We are also removing bottlenecks to future growth by investing in transport.  That makes good economic sense.  Continuing to increase our spend on public infrastructure, road projects and school projects will not cause overheating.  Other errors may cause that.<\/p> <p> In terms of the facts about housing that were mentioned by Deputy Cullinane, I will not go over the debate we had earlier.  We all acknowledge the housing shortage and the crisis that exists with homelessness.  I acknowledge that there are more people in emergency accommodation today than there were a year ago.  I am not in denial about the challenge we face in that regard.  However, one fact the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, did not mention in the debate earlier is the figures that have just been released on rents.  They show that rents increased by just 1% in the last quarter and by 1.1% in the previous quarter.  That is two quarters in which rent has increased by approximately 1% as compared with a year-on-year increase of approximately 7%-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300020#S01700","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528892700,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Rents are out of control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300021#T00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892700,"counter":302,"content":"<p>They are unaffordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300021#T00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1528892700,"counter":303,"content":"<p>That indicates rents are stabilising and that the policy of rent pressure zones is working.

It all depends on the type of Brexit, whether it is a hard Brexit or one where the UK stays in the customs union and is aligned with the Single Market.  There are many different scenarios and the period of transition, if there is one, will be important in that regard.  None of the many analyses I have seen to date indicates that even a hard Brexit would put Ireland into recession.  They indicate that in all the scenarios for Brexit our economy will grow more slowly than it might have otherwise and employment growth will be less than it might otherwise have been.  The issue is the opportunity cost as opposed to triggering a recession or a downturn.  However, we must be wise to even that possibility because it represents a major change in our economy and our trading relations.  That is the reason the Government is working so hard to ensure we continue to have the closest possible relationship with the UK after Brexit - that there is a transition period and that things change as little as possible after it.  That is where we are at the moment in the negotiations, but they are not easy negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The office of emergency planning has worked very well.  I have no difficulty crediting the former Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, with establishing it.  A great deal has been learned from the various emergencies it has handled.

We are also like-minded on many EU issues and we discussed how to further intensify our co-operation across the EU agenda. <\/p>  <p>  This is particularly important in light of the debate on the future of Europe, where both of us are positive and ambitious.  We both believe that we should implement agreed measures in areas that directly benefit our citizens' daily lives.  For example, we wish to complete the Single Market, the capital markets union and the banking union.  We want to rapidly progress the digital Single Market.  We also want to develop our relations with other parts of the world. <\/p>  <p>  Prime Minister Michel and I discussed the Brexit negotiations in advance of the June European Council and the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and all that flows from it - peace in Britain and Ireland, power sharing in the North and ever closer North-South co-operation.  <\/p>  <p>  I thanked the Prime Minister for his strong, ongoing support regarding our unique concerns and highlighted the need to ensure the commitments and principles agreed between the EU and the UK last December are translated into legal text of the withdrawal agreement. <\/p>  <p>  After Ireland, Belgium is one of the countries most likely to be adversely affected by Brexit due to its strong trading relationship with the UK.  We both agreed that we want the future relationship between the EU and the UK to be as deep, close and comprehensive as possible, while insisting that there be a level playing field, fair competition and that the integrity of the Single Market be protected.  <\/p>  <p>  The Prime Minister and I discussed a range of other EU issues, including the EU budget.  We agreed on the need to ensure continued funding for agriculture, cohesion and research and development, and to be open to looking at other areas if they bring additional European value.  We both support the EU enlargement process. <\/p>  <p>  We exchanged views on transatlantic relations, where we agreed on the need for a strong EU response to US tariffs.  We also acknowledged the long-term importance of the relationship.  We have a united front on relations with Russia. <\/p>  <p>  We agreed that the EU should reinvigorate its relations with Africa to develop a dynamic and political relationship that produces results. <\/p>  <p>  Prime Minister Michel had some other engagements during his visit to Ireland.  I was pleased that he took the time to visit the Border region, where he was accompanied by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and where he had the opportunity to speak with people and see the Border at first hand.<\/p>  <p>  My meeting with Prime Minister Michel was part of my ongoing bilateral engagement with EU and international counterparts, which remains crucial on Brexit and other important EU issues.  In this context, I look forward to meeting the new Prime Minister of Spain, Mr. Pedro Sanchez, tomorrow in Madrid.<\/p><p>I am also scheduled to meet the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, in Dublin on 21 June and the Austrian Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, in Dublin on 9 July.  In addition to such scheduled bilateral meetings, I meet and speak regularly with my EU counterparts at formal and informal meetings of the European Council and also of the EPP, where I use every opportunity to advance Ireland's interests.<\/p> <p> I attended the most recent EU summit on 17 May, the week before my meeting with the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Michel.

Most of us are now deeply concerned about the way the negotiations on Brexit with the United Kingdom are unfolding.  Did the Taoiseach raise the following matter which might have had some consideration with the Belgian Prime Minister and will he raise it with the new Socialist Prime Minister of Spain when he meets him tomorrow?  I refer to the potential of extending the period of time for the completion of Article 50, in other words to move beyond the 29 March 2019 deadline if it was felt there was an advantage to having further time.  Has that been given any consideration?<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the strategic importance of trade with the United Kingdom, as the Taoiseach has rightly said, Belgium will be one of the member states that is significantly impacted.  Up to now we have maintained a very strong sense of solidarity across the EU 27.  Many of us were concerned that when we reached the trade section of talks, if we had not got the Irish Border matter resolved, there would be pressure put on us to ensure that the final settlement would be agreed because trade would be so important.  Was that matter broached with the Belgian Prime Minister and was there a clear sense of that continued solidarity?<\/p>  <p>  On the discussions on Africa, migration is a highly significant issue.  It has caused political upheaval and the rise of nationalism and populism in many countries.

When we look back over transcripts and reports of the Taoiseach's words in recent days, it is striking how far he is willing to go to avoid admitting how a critical deadline set by him is being missed.  It is unfortunately the way of these things that the Taoiseach will probably respond by saying that this is somehow the Opposition's fault.<\/p>  <p>  For six months we have been told in this House and recently in Dundalk that we needed substantial progress on a backstop legal text by the end of June, and that this was, according to both the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, \"a very important date from an Irish perspective\".  We were supposed to have locked down the bulletproof, concrete and ironclad backstop text by 22 June.  We were told that continuing the negotiations would require significant progress on the backstop text.  Is the Taoiseach standing over the claim that the backstop as interpreted by him is bulletproof, concrete and ironclad?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that it is his position that the talks will proceed without any significant progress on the backstop text?<\/p>  <p>  Given that Michel Barnier has formally ruled out the UK proposals, which the Taoiseach welcomed and clearly preferred, does he accept that a new approach is required?  In particular will he support a Northern Ireland-specific permanent proposal rather than continuing to focus solely on the overall deal?  We were told last year that delinking Ireland from the final negotiations on the withdrawal text was vital.

I understand that Belgium may have a different demographic with more of an urbanised culture.  I ask the Taoiseach to update us on that.<\/p>  <p>  Was trade with Asia discussed as part of the briefing, given the success of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, with Irish beef now going into China?  The Asian population of 4.5 billion represents 60% of the world's population.  While we may compete with countries in selling products to that market, smaller countries with significant economic relationships with the UK and which are facing risk may have some synergy regarding trade with Asia.

I say that because it was reported late last year that $221 billion worth of profits were shifted offshore from Belgium to tax havens around the world, which is obviously a matter of very serious concern to the tax authorities.  That equates to about half of Belgium's GDP.  We might be discussing it with Belgium this week as yet more evidence has been uncovered showing Ireland's role in the international network of tax havens.  US and Danish economists have pointed out that more profits are shifted to Ireland because our tax code is riddled with loopholes than to all the tax havens in the Caribbean combined.  This is further evidence that Ireland is a tax haven and is part of an international architecture of tax avoidance and tax evasion which is costing tax authorities around the world about &euro;200 billion annually, which is absolutely starving tax authorities of revenue needed for vital public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300022#U00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1528893300,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Deputy Howlin asked whether it would be possible to extend the Article 50 deadline beyond 29 March 2019.  I understand that is possible under the treaties, but could only be done by unanimity - it would require all 27 member states to agree to it.  Currently the United Kingdom has not asked for it and I do not see any benefit in offering it at this stage.  I believe the UK needs to make decisions and choices.  The British continually seem to have internal debates among each other.  While there has been some improvement in recent months, very often the policy of \"having your cake and eating it\" seems to be at the centre of the UK's requests of the European Union.  Some decisions need to be made by the United Kingdom Government.  Putting off a decision does not make it any easier.  I would rather not talk about extending that deadline at the moment.  As I have said, the UK has not requested it and so I do not think we should even consider it at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  We did have a conversation about an EU Marshall-type plan for Africa.  I have an interest in the matter and I discussed it in my speech to the European Parliament earlier in the year.  Chancellor Merkel is also very enthusiastic about it.  Belgium has history in central Africa, as do we but coming from a very different perspective and history.  Both of us are very much of the view that part of Europe's external efforts in the future should be focused on Africa, in order to build up Africa as a trading partner and also to remove some of the push factors that cause mass migration from Africa to the European Union.  We spoke about how if we get it right, the Africa of the future could be a little bit like Asia now, a continent where 1 billion people have been lifted out of poverty and a continent with which we now want to cut trade deals rather than provide aid to.  That will require not just aid but assistance with governance, democratisation and so on.<\/p><p>As is always the case on European issues, there can often by agreement on sentiment and policy but when it comes to agreeing to increase budget contributions people are less enthusiastic.  Ireland is one of the countries that is willing to increase its budget contribution to the European Union.<\/p> <p> Deputy Neville asked if agriculture and trade was one of the issues discussed at the meeting.  We discussed the impact potentially on the ports of Zeebrugge and Antwerp which receive a lot of trade from Britain and Ireland as well.  We are very much aligned in our wishes that countries neighbouring the United Kingdom retain trading arrangements that are as close to what they are now.  We also discussed Mercusor.  The House will be aware that Ireland and France have expressed real concerns about the impact a free trade agreement with the Mercusor countries could have on our beef industry.  What I did not know until the meeting was that this concern is shared by the Belgian Government because Belgium also has a large agriculture sector and a very important and sensitive beef sector.  These talks are ongoing.  We do have allies in taking the view that a free trade agreement with the Mercusor countries would benefit all economies in Europe but we must also protect sensitive sectors such as the beef sector.  We had that discussion and agreement over a working lunch.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that the deadline for the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol is and always has been October.  I said this last March when the European guidelines were issued.  We do need to see real and substantial progress by the June summit.  The European leaders - the prime ministers and presidents - will determine at that meeting whether they believe real and substantial progress has been made.  While the UK's proposal last week is welcome and is a small step forward, it falls short.  Without more from London, as things stand today, I cannot say that we have achieved real and substantial progress but there is still two weeks between now and the summit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300022#U00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","time":1528893900,"counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300023#V00200"},{"type":"question","time":1528893900,"counter":326,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[23790\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300023#V00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his Department's legislative priorities.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1528893900,"counter":327,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[24671\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300023#V00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the status of Bills under preparation in his Department.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1528893900,"counter":328,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[25390\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300023#V00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his Department's legislative priorities.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1528893900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>My Department has responsibility for the National Economic and Social Council, NESC. <\/p><p>The National Economic and Social Council statutory basis is as a body under the framework of the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006.

As people are aware, it is a mortgage scheme for first-time buyers backed by the Government.  It is now available through all local authorities.  A first-time buyer can apply for a Rebuilding Ireland home loan to purchase a new or second-hand property or to build his or her own home.  Up to 90% of the market value of the property can be borrowed.  That is the background to the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As the Topical Issue matter I tabled states, I wish to discuss the credit policy 2018 and the Rebuilding Ireland home loans scheme.  The wording I submitted deals with the secrecy attached to the credit policy 2018, under which applications are considered.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is aware that well over 600 or 700 applications have been made.  There is, approximately, a 50% refusal rate among those that have been assessed.  Citizens in a democracy have a right to know how the decision to refuse their application was made.  The appeal mechanism is merely internal within the local authority.  There is no external appeals mechanism.  There is no method for appealing to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or to the ordinary Ombudsman as to how the local authority conducted the appeal in respect of an application.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no external appeals mechanism whatsoever and that is all the more reason that citizens should have access to the criteria under which their application was considered.  They could then put in an appeal, even if it is a poor mechanism in the first place because it is internal to the local authority.  No doubt it will be dealt with by somebody who was not on the credit committee.  I submitted a parliamentary question asking for a copy of the criteria in view of the number of refusals of which I have been made aware.  In the reply of 14 April 2018, I was told that it was a commercially sensitive document, it was not in the public interest to publish it and it would conflict with the economic interests of the State.  The document remains confidential on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  That is not acceptable.  I think the Minister of State knows that.  If the Government has learned anything in this day and age, it is that citizens, and the rights of citizens, must be respected.  In this case, citizens' rights are being infringed.  The Department needs to come into the 21st century.  It must know it cannot deal with citizens' information in a secretive manner.  The members of this Government must surely have learned that.  How can a person put in an appeal if he or she does not know the criteria according to which his or her application was refused in the first place?  The current semi-appeals mechanism, internal to the local authority, makes no sense.  There should be a mechanism everywhere in the State so that an appeal can be put in and it is known what the appeal is against. <\/p><p>People are appealing on the blind, however, and the idea of a commercially sensitive document by which one's application was judged is nonsense in this day and age.  It would not stand up to objective scrutiny anywhere in terms of the rights of the applicants.  <\/p> <p> I am asking the Minister of State to reconsider the old 19th century approach whereby nobody is entitled to question the decision of a local authority.  Local authorities make commercial decisions all the time.  They put contracts out for tender and people know the criteria under which contracts are awarded.  If people did not know the criteria applied the process would be deemed invalid.  This ridiculous requirement for commercial sensitivity around how applications are judged should be removed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300025#CC00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528895400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I feel somewhat disadvantaged because the wording in front of me is slightly different from the wording submitted by Deputy Fleming.  I thank him for raising the issue nonetheless.<\/p>  <p>  Following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the house purchase loan and the home choice loan, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, introduced a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, earlier this year to replace the existing schemes.  The new loan scheme is being implemented in accordance with the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018.  The regulations broadly set out the criteria for eligibility for loans, the maximum values for properties which may be purchased under the new scheme, as well as the duties of local authorities and borrowers.  <\/p>  <p>  The new loan enables creditworthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range where they cannot obtain a mortgage from a commercial lender.  Long-term financing, provided by the Housing Finance Agency, has enabled the Rebuilding Ireland home loan to be provided at low fixed rates of interest.  These low interest rates enable local authorities to act as lenders to eligible individuals who find themselves in this situation and enable them to purchase their own home.  The loans are provided by the local authorities and the applications are assessed by the Housing Agency on their behalf.  Each local authority must have in place a credit committee, which makes the final decision on applications for loans. There is also an appeal procedure in each local authority in order that those who are not satisfied with a decision regarding their application can have the decision reviewed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency undertakes a detailed credit analysis, based on credit information furnished by the borrower, such as employment history, salary and financial statements; available information, such as the borrower's credit history, which is detailed in a credit check; and an evaluation of the borrower&rsquo;s credit needs and ability to pay.  The agency then makes a recommendation to the local authority as to whether a loan should be made to the applicant, which is then considered and decided upon by the local authority&rsquo;s credit committee.  The regulations provide for the Minister to issue a statutory credit policy, giving detailed guidance to local authorities for the processing of loan applications and the making of loans under the regulations.  This updated document replaces the credit policy that was in place for the previous local authority lending schemes, which have now been superseded by the new home loan scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Deputy has in the past raised the issue of publishing the credit policy.  The revised policy is an internal document designed to provide written guidance to local authorities for managing and processing loan applications.  Decisions by local authorities as to whether to advance a loan to an individual are taken on a case-by-case basis within the criteria as set out in the credit policy.  As such, the policy is a commercially sensitive document, as would be the case with any other lender.  Therefore, it would not be in the public interest to publish it, as this would conflict with the economic interests of the State and could seriously compromise the ability of local authorities to lend in an effective manner or otherwise impair their functions in this regard.  On this basis, the Minister intends to continue the approach, which has been in place in respect of credit policies that governed previous local authority loan schemes, and treat the credit policy as confidential. <\/p>  <p>  The operation of the new home loan scheme is still at a very early stage.  However, the Housing Agency has indicated that by the end of last month, it had received a total of 1,150 valid applications from local authorities for assessment since the launch of the loan scheme.  Of these, 876 have been assessed and 52% of the applications which have been assessed have been recommended for approval.  The Department has been working closely with local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and the Housing Agency to ensure that the new mortgage scheme is understood, accessible and operating as effectively as possible, particularly to address some initial teething problems that arose.  Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has met the chief executive of the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency.  The Department has put in place a number of measures to ensure that information on the scheme is widely available.  The dedicated Rebuilding Ireland home loan website includes a helpful frequently asked questions document and a borrower information booklet, which may answer any questions people may have.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300026#DD00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1528895400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has confirmed that the rejection rate is approximately 50%.  If another Department was operating a scheme and its rejection rate was 50%, with no appeal to the Ombudsman or the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman available, the Minister of State would not be able to stand over it.  He should ask his officials to come into the 21st century.  There is no level of commercial sensitivity involved in this.  People have only sought a loan from the local authorities because they have not been able to get a commercial loan on the open market.  The local authorities are a place of last resort for them.  As for the rejection rate, the Minister of State stated the Housing Agency undertakes a detailed credit analysis and considers credit history, ability to pay and the borrower's credit needs.  That should be spelled out in the criteria and people should be informed which element of the criteria they failed to meet.  The idea of having secret criteria about which people will not be informed and which will not be shared does not make any sense in this day and age.  I note it is a substantial document.<\/p>  <p>  We have had enough of public bodies refusing to tell the public, particularly people dealing with the public bodies, that they cannot have access to information.  Personal information and the reason for decisions are being concealed.  Public bodies are refusing to pass on information.  If the Minister of State has learned anything from the actions of another Department in recent months, he must know that there is no basis for a public body operating in secret when it comes to the information of citizens.  Those days are over.  That manner of operating might have been valid in the last century.  It is not acceptable now.  Any independent person looking at this could not stand over it.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme is failing because it is disjointed.  The Minister of Finance answered a parliamentary question I had tabled last night on the help-to-buy scheme, which suggested that people who are divorced and who previously owned a house cannot access that scheme.  Those people, thankfully, can avail of this scheme in special circumstances.  We have two schemes which are designed to help people to buy houses.  The Department is saying some people are eligible but they are then refused, and they are then allowed access to this scheme.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking between the State agencies on this matter.  The fact that the Ombudsman and financial ombudsman have been excluded from any independent review says it all.  This matter must be revisited.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300026#DD00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1528895400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I will certainly talk to the officials and the Minister.

That certainly applies to financial information.  Two freedom of information requests for the credit policy were submitted to the Department in March but were refused under the Freedom of Information Act on the grounds that the documents were commercially sensitive and that their release would be contrary to the financial and economic interests of the State.  Perhaps a balance can be struck regarding the rights of citizens to access their own personal information but equally, commercial sensitivity is attached to lending decisions by whatever organisation - in this case, an arm of the State - makes that decision.  It may well have other impacts on the wider public good.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak to officials about the possibility of whether there can be some meeting of minds but the information is quite sensitive and its release could have other negative effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300026#DD00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Australian Delegation","time":1528895400,"counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300026#DD00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1528895400,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Before moving on to the next Topical Issue matter, I wish on my own behalf, and on behalf of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to offer a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to the delegation from Australia, which I had the honour of meeting last night when it arrived at Dublin Airport.

I would also like to highlight the pretty much abject failure of Irish Water to adequately communicate with citizens in the particular part of Skerries that is affected.  My phone started ringing on Thursday evening in respect of water outages.  Those outages resulted in numerous houses losing their supply completely.  Irish Water stated that this was because the houses were on elevated ground or at the extremities of the network.  Information has now been provided to locals, including by individual Irish Water engineers, to the effect that there might be a missing link within the network in that part of the community.  I find this unacceptable.  Planning permissions were granted and hundreds of thousands of euro have been parted with by dozens of families in recent months and years, yet they cannot rely on the basic principle that the State will supply them with water.  On their behalf, I find what is happening completely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to see cogent and deliverable plans put in place as quickly as possible so that a recurrence of this problem can be avoided in future.

That is very difficult for people with young children, for older people and for those who are sick.  The fragility of our water system is there for all to see.  We saw it in Drogheda last year and we have seen it in many other areas throughout the country.  As a national utility, Irish Water is tasked with fixing our antiquated water infrastructure system.  The company says that the problem in Skerries is due to the low level of water in the Thomastown Reservoir due to the recent dry spell and to a number of networking issues.  I understand that it has not rained in a couple of weeks, but I do not accept that as a reason for the water in the reservoir to drop to such a low level.<\/p>  <p>  I have lived in Skerries for approximately 40 years.  I have lived through numerous heat waves and dry spells but I have never before seen such a catastrophic failure in our water system.  There has to be another factor to this, and I believe that there is.  I think the main issue lies in the other networking issues to which Irish Water refers.  The company needs to come clean on this.  Separate to the general water problems in Skerries associated with the levels at Thomastown Reservoir, there is a particular problem in the newest estates of Barnageeragh Cove and Hamilton Hill.  Both are on the edge of Skerries and located on higher ground.  They have been impacted most severely, with no supply at all during the so-called restricted supply periods.  This can only be due to poor water infrastructure design which has not taken account of the terrain in the estates.  I accept that they are on high ground but explaining a failure of water supply by saying that a community is located at the extremities of the network is not an acceptable response from Irish Water.  The network should be able to provide any planned estates with the same level of water security as homes central to the network system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300027#EE00500","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1528896000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>In the past 18 months, there have been 20 separate incidents of water shortages and outages in Skerries.

For people with small children, it is not good enough to get 12 hours' notice of a water shortage.  Sometimes they do not even get that.  I echo what the other Deputies said, namely, that any alterations in the capital plans that have to be made should be made.  I do not think it is acceptable to say to people that their water supply cannot be guaranteed because they live on a hill.  Certainly, that was not said to them when they were buying their homes.  They have the same right to an adequate supply of water as anybody else.  It is disrespectful to refer to water restrictions and water shortages when many are experiencing a complete cessation of supply.<\/p>  <p>  If the sun is shining, it is supposed to be a good thing.  It cannot be the case that if one happens to live in Skerries, the sun shining means that one cannot have a shower in the evening.  That is just not acceptable.  It is not right.  If a booster pump can be put in place, that should be done.  Equally, measures to address this need to be taken because more building is planned.  Skerries is a fast-expanding town.  That is a very good thing.  More building is planned even further up the hill in question.  What will the Government say to those families?  It is not acceptable that families with young children have to go to tanks or go to Swords and elsewhere to source bottled water, particularly when one considers the number of young families affected.

The ongoing issues with the water supply in Skerries have been prominent for the past week.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  Irish Water, as a single national utility, is taking a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment.  The company recognises that many decades of underinvestment have led to a legacy of deficiencies in our drinking water and wastewater treatment plants and networks.  Its water services plan published in October 2015 sets out a strategy over 25 years to ensure the provision of clean, safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for economic and social development.<\/p>  <p>  The first ever water services policy statement, prepared in line with the Water Services Acts, which was recently launched by the Minister, outlines a clear direction for strategic planning and decision-making on water and wastewater services in Ireland.  It sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans.  It will provide the context in which necessary funding and investment plans by Irish Water will be framed and agreed.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the water services policy statement, Irish Water&rsquo;s forthcoming strategic funding plan will set out the costs of providing domestic and non-domestic water services and the recovery of these costs.  It will distinguish between operational and capital expenditure, and provide projections of income over the multi-annual period, 2020 to 2024.  Subject to its approval by the Minister, Deputy Murphy, the strategic funding plan will feed into the allowed revenue determination for Irish Water by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, as the economic regulator of Irish Water, and, ultimately, feed into annual Estimates and the budgetary process.<\/p>  <p>  The water supply issues in Skerries and elsewhere are a consequence of legacy underinvestment, which has been exacerbated by a lack of planned asset management and maintenance programmes.  Furthermore, Irish Water has confirmed that the recent dry spell and increased seasonal demand are contributing to the reduced available supply of treated drinking water for Skerries and surrounding areas, while increased demand, in particular from Rush, has led to reduced levels in the Thomastown reservoir.  Consequently, the company had to impose restrictions on the water supply serving Skerries and surrounding areas.  Irish Water has asked those customers who do have full supply to conserve water by refraining from watering gardens, washing cars, using power hoses and minimising their use generally.  Every small effort to save water will contribute to maintaining supplies and benefit the entire community by reducing the likelihood of further restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water, together with Fingal County Council, is investigating the possibility of network reconfiguration to provide flows to the areas worst impacted by the restrictions, namely, those at the extremities of the network and on higher ground.  In the longer term, the company is examining an option to provide a booster pumping station on the feeder main to the Thomastown reservoir to increase its capacity from about 2.8 million l per day to 4 million l per day, subject to full evaluation of the pipe capacity for the increased pressure.  This option will require detailed planning, design and construction and, therefore, will be targeted at 2019 delivery.  With regard to the Deputies' comments, the Government will financially support the measures Irish Water deems necessary to ensure people have access to proper water in Skerries and the surrounding areas.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review of water supply infrastructure across the greater Dublin area, other strengthening of the strategic networks is planned over the next two to three years to give greater resilience in the system, for example, to enable greater flexibility between the Fingal and Dublin city supply networks in this area.  Consequently, Irish Water is exhausting all avenues in implementing a series of actions to address the challenge of water supply and minimise disruptions to the communities in Skerries, as well as longer-term plans to ensure a sustainable resilient water supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300028#FF00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1528896600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The Minister of State mentioned there was an infrastructural deficit and poor maintenance, but I would like to know who is responsible for this.  Was it the local authority prior to 2014?  Was it a failure on the part of Irish Water to make submissions to planning applications over the past four or five years?  Was it a failure on the part of the local authority in approving occupation or commencement orders for planning permissions that had been granted?  If the residents who forked out as much as &euro;500,000 for properties in Skerries and who have no water for a sustained period were informed of that, perhaps we might be in a different position.  I accept what has been said by the Minister of State, and I accept there are planning issues associated with the infrastructural requirements, but that will not resolve the problem in the short term.  Short and long-term resolutions are needed to these issues.  The Minister of State has not put the timelines on the record of the House.

My understanding is Irish Water is examining a reconfiguration immediately of the existing network.  The booster station, which will increase capacity to 4 million l a day, could be delivered in 2019, according to Irish Water and the Minister of State but what can we do now?<\/p>  <p>  This happens in certain areas throughout the country on a regular basis, but being selfish about Skerries, there is, and has been, a health issue.  I have spoken to people with young children.  There is a serious hygiene issue; it is not just an inconvenience.  It is also an issue for the businesses in the town.  Will Fingal County Council consider rate rebates for the period they have not had water?  Skerries is a town with many restaurants, hairdressers and bars.  They have gone to additional expense during this period.  I agree with Deputy Farrell that a detailed timeline is needed.  What are we doing now to make sure there is a robust supply in the interim while Irish Water delivers a solution for 2019, according to its statement?

There is no sign of that letting up, even during the summer when one might think things are going to be a bit easier.  We simply cannot allow this to continue and face another winter, or perhaps more than one, before we get the promised 96-bed unit.  We absolutely need interim solutions now.  Such solutions exist.  For example, we could open all the available beds in the area.  A number of us have raised the idea of a modular unit.  It is essential that the level of staffing is sufficient for the needs of the people in the mid-west.  I do not have time to get into the statistics involved but a senior clinician, Dr. Gerard Burke, has demonstrated that there is an inequality in the number of whole-time equivalent acute hospital staff in the mid-west compared with other regions.  It is estimated at 10.16 per 1,000 in the mid-west, with the national average being 11.4 per 1,000.  We are understaffed and under-resourced.

The mid-west has a catchment area of 400,000 but it does not have the bed capacity or staffing to deal with that.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan noted, whole-time equivalent rates in the mid-west are 14% lower than the national figure.  This leads to an increase in the standardised mortality rate in the mid-west.  It is a shocking indictment of the health service that there is such disproportionality between one area and another.  It comes down to retention and recruitment of staff across all hospitals in the region but also arises from deployment of consultants and medical staff across the model 2 and model 4 hospitals in the region.

Let me start by recognising that this Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health at &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years, which will provide for a major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand in the coming years.  Within this context in February of this year the Department of Health published the health service capacity review, the findings of which now provide the evidence base for capacity decisions.  This report concludes that if the required reforms are implemented, nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds will be required by 2031.<\/p>  <p>  As a first step towards implementing this recommendation, the Minister has asked the Department to work with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system that can be opened and staffed this year and in 2019.  The HSE is continuing to work on a submission in this regard, with the aim of formulating an evidence-based plan for increasing bed capacity nationally that will form the basis of discussions with colleagues in government on the financing of this important programme of work.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Jan O'Sullivan, Harty and Neville have specifically raised concerns about the plans as they relate to University Hospital Limerick.<\/p><p>The need to address bed capacity at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is recognised by all stakeholders.  As the Deputies will be aware, a new emergency department was opened at University Hospital Limerick on 29 May 2017.  The &euro;24 million development aimed to provide University Hospital Limerick with increased capacity for emergency medicine to meet the demands of population growth and changing service models and to improve efficiency targets.  In addition, 17 new short-stay beds were opened in December 2017 as part of winter measures aimed at alleviating pressure on the emergency department and meeting the growing demand for services in this period.  Looking forward, the national development plan includes provision for a 96-bed replacement ward block at University Hospital Limerick.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, can confirm that the HSE capital plan for 2018 includes funding to progress the design phase of this project.  In the meantime, the HSE is also considering a submission by University of Limerick hospital group to develop a modular inpatient facility at University Hospital Limerick which will have capacity for up to a further 60 beds.  A decision on this, as part of the broader work being brought forward by the Department of Health and the HSE to increase bed capacity in advance of this winter and throughout 2019 will be made as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> We all acknowledge that the challenges we face are significant.  Therefore, importantly, this focus on increasing capacity will be matched by forthcoming reforms as set out in the all-party Sl&aacute;intecare report.  This work will be overseen through the establishment in the Department of a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office, the publication of a detailed Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan and the appointment shortly of an executive director for the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.

It is quite clear we come out on top of the trolley list constantly.  Furthermore, when we talk about the inequality in the provision of acute medical staff, we have the statistics.  We are not just talking about unfilled posts; we are actually talking about unallocated posts.  In other words, the region simply is not allocated the equivalent number of posts as other regions.  We are therefore asking that the mid-west region be prioritised so we do not have to put people through an absolutely intolerable winter, with elderly people lying on trolleys for hours and hours waiting to get beds.

The Saolta west group and the southern group are, I think, getting a disproportionate amount of resources compared to the mid-west, and this is a fundamental issue which is leading to overcrowding in our hospitals.  Regarding the Minister of State's reference to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, it has been published for over a year, but there has been no Government response to it.  In the Sl&aacute;intecare report reference is made to how these issues can be tackled on a national basis, though I am of course particularly concerned about the mid-west.  The failure of the Government to respond to Sl&aacute;intecare is most regrettable.  The issue really amounts to beds and staffing.  We need more step-down beds in our model 2 hospitals, we need modular units in the regional hospitals and we need enhanced community intervention teams, but we also specifically need more diagnostics.  Patients are waiting in hospital for inordinately long periods to get diagnostics, particularly scanning.  Unfortunately, our scanning units work on a five-day basis, nine to five, but people require them on a 24-hour basis.  We need to look at all these aspects which feed into the issue of overcrowding in Limerick because it is a multifactorial issue.  Limerick, unfortunately, is a black spot in respect of bed capacity and overcrowding.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, there are 53 people on trolleys in Limerick today, in the middle of summer, and that is completely unacceptable.

Deputy Harty has outlined the statistics as of today, but the statistics were much higher last winter, when there is more demand on services.  I have communicated the correspondence from Dr. Gerry Burke to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and am awaiting feedback on it from the Minister.  There are modular units going into South Tipperary General Hospital.  Perhaps it would be an idea to try to speed this up in order that something could be done in conjunction with Tipperary to try to get this into Limerick before the winter.  It takes 26 weeks to build these units off-site.  Obviously, there are planning permission issues as well, but all that can be dealt with off-site.  Twenty-six weeks is three months, so we still have time to try to get this in before winter kicks in.

the worsening shortage of social and affordable housing and emergency accommodation in Ireland now constitutes a national emergency;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; almost 10,000 people are living in emergency accommodation and 144,000 applicants are on housing waiting lists, including the Rental Accommodation Scheme and Housing Assistance Payment fixed transfer lists;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; tens of thousands of people on low- and middle- incomes are paying unaffordable rents and are simultaneously locked out of the house purchase market due to the lack of supply and the knock-on dramatic increase in property prices;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the State has failed in its duty to directly build public and affordable housing on publicly owned land despite local authorities controlling, as of December 2017, 1,317 hectares of zoned residential land with capacity for 48,724 dwellings;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the delivery of directly provided public and local authority housing in recent years has been negligible, with only 1,058 new units built\/acquired, including regeneration, by local authorities in 2017 and no affordable housing schemes, despite repeated commitments by the Government to do so;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the central pillar of any Government policy must prioritise a decisive shift towards the direct provision of public and affordable housing on public land rather than the current reliance on private sector solutions; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; notwithstanding the above, it is incumbent on the Government and the D&aacute;il to use all other measures that could help accelerate the rapid delivery of public and affordable homes;<\/blockquote>further notes that:<blockquote>&mdash; the Central Statics Office identified 183,312 empty homes in 2016;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; it must be a matter of urgency to take measures to return to use any and all vacant units, properties and sites suitable for residential use, particularly given that the Government&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Strategy has delivered only 416 homes to local authorities in 2016 and 2017;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the delivery of social housing on private developments, through Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Part V), has been minimal with only 388 homes delivered in 2017;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the failure of Part V to deliver any affordable homes arises from the reduction of the Part V obligation from 20% to 10%;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; slow delivery of residential development by the private sector has almost certainly been exacerbated by land hoarding, property speculation and the drip-feeding of development to keep property prices high;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; with market prices of completed units at record levels, the cost of local authorities acquiring the Part V 10% obligation will, in many cases, be prohibitive and generally more expensive than the cost of local authority builds;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; according to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, the all-in cost of building a new social housing unit is between &euro;175,000 and &euro;211,000, whereas average prices on the property market are now at &euro;380,000 in Dublin, therefore, the cost of acquiring Part V units is enormously more expensive to local authorities than it would be to build on 10% of land acquired at existing-use-value;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; waiting for the completion of units by private developers before acquiring the 10% will also mean, in many cases, a much slower delivery of public homes and uncertainty about the timeline of such delivery if the private developers decide to drip-feed development of sites, or sit on all or part of such sites for long periods of time for speculative purposes, or in expectation of higher market prices in the future; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has now discharged almost all of its debt obligations through property and asset sales, removing any justification for further disposal of development land or property that could be used to address the current housing emergency, but still controls, as of December 2017, 1,691 hectares of zoned residential land with capacity for 65,399 dwellings, and in Dublin alone controls land with the potential to build 43,075 dwellings;<\/blockquote>demands a radical shift in policy to address the housing and homelessness emergency which will contain as its central pillar the provision of public and affordable housing on publicly owned land; and<br \/><br \/>notwithstanding the above, demands in addition:<blockquote>&mdash; the establishment of multi-disciplinary empty home and property teams in each local authority, dedicated to proactively identifying vacant housing units, properties and sites with potential for refurbishment as residential units;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that empty home and property teams will, in the first instance, attempt to engage with property owners with a view to working with them to return to residential use the unit, property or site;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that, where suitable units, properties or sites are vacant for more than six months, without good reason, or where a property owner refuses to engage with the empty home and property teams, the local authority shall employ its compulsory acquisition powers to bring these units, properties or sites into use;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the remit of the empty home and property teams will also include the identification of suitable vacant units, properties or sites owned by Government departments, semi-State agencies or agencies under the aegis of Government Departments, and the power to acquire the property for development as public and affordable housing;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that empty home and property teams shall include officers responsible for identifying suitable units, properties and sites and making contact with owners and all necessary qualified professionals such as architects, engineers, quantity surveyors etc. to ensure the timely return to use of all suitable units, properties and sites;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that empty home and property teams will set out options for vacant units, sites and properties to return them to residential use, which shall include a range of assistance measures;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that in any option where financial support is provided by local authorities for returning units to residential use, these units will be used for public and affordable housing;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Part V requirement be immediately increased from 10% social housing to a minimum of 20% public and affordable housing;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that where there has been any State aid for private development, such as the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), Home Building Finance Ireland or Strategic Development Zone designation, the Part V requirement would be a minimum of 30% (40% with LIHAF funding) public and affordable housing;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that all definitions of affordable housing are at a price that is accessible to those on incomes above the eligibility criteria for social housing and below &euro;80,000 per annum, adhering to the standard of repayments being no more than 35% of net income after tax and social insurance;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that, in agreeing Part V arrangements with developers, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will, by regulation, instruct local authorities to prioritise, from now on, the transfer of land option rather than completed units, as the cheapest and most timely mechanism to deliver public and affordable housing, stipulating that the land transfer must be completed within six months of the decision date of the planning permission or the application will be deemed invalid; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Government legislate immediately to change the mandate of NAMA to be a vehicle for public and affordable housing and ensure that it immediately ceases the sale or disposal of development land or residential units on the open market.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>This motion is an attempt to ring the alarm bells about what I think is the underlying problem generating the current housing and homelessness emergency and to propose a number of radical but practical actions that could begin to address that crisis.  The point we argue in this motion is that the intolerable human misery the current housing and homelessness emergency is causing is not an accident but rather arises from rampant land-hoarding, property speculation and profiteering by investors, landlords and developers and that the Government's policies are actively facilitating this rather than dealing with it and doing what is necessary, which is for the State itself to build in large quantities public and affordable housing on its own land.<\/p><p>I think we have debated at length here the human misery aspect of this and the impossibility of the situation that huge numbers of people face, but it really is shameful.  There are 10,000 families in emergency accommodation, 144,000 people on housing waiting lists, once one includes HAP and RAS fixed transfer lists, and hundreds of thousands of people paying extortionate rents and effectively locked out of the purchase market.  The Ombudsman for Children's report today details many of the complaints coming into the ombudsman's office about the intolerable conditions that children living in emergency accommodation are having to suffer.  There is further evidence of the madness of the property market, with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, saying rents have risen by 7%.  The CSO figures show property prices rose 13% last year.  The Government says it is trying to address all this, but then one considers the facts.  Last year, 1,058 local authority housing units were built, there were 799 approved housing body builds and a pathetic 388 homes were delivered through Part V arrangements with the private sector.  This is the background to the motion.<\/p><p> As for private construction, we do not even know how many houses are being built.  There is a major dispute about the number but we know whatever it is, it is abysmal.  Goodbody states it is 9,000 but I suggest it is lower than that.  There is another piece of evidence which has not yet entered the debate.  If we only got 388 Part V units back, that means 3,888 private houses were built in developments of more than ten.  While there would have been developments of less than ten units, are we really suggesting that as many as 5,000 to 8,000 units were in such developments?  That is not credible.  The output is miserable against a background of a catastrophic and worsening crisis.  <\/p> <p> In this motion, we state the reason for this is because both the State and the private sector are hoarding land and the private sector is simply speculating.  Investors, landlords and developers are speculating on land and property prices to inflate the values of their holdings, often to flip them, but with no intention to build the housing necessary to address the housing crisis and they have absolutely no intention of providing that housing at levels that are affordable to the people who need it.<\/p> <p> The problem certainly is not one of a lack of zoned building land.  Local authorities alone have enough zoned building land for 45,000 units.  NAMA has enough building land for 65,000 units.  However, the delivery on this is pathetic.  In NAMA's case, only 7,000 units were delivered of a potential 65,000.  Some 50,000 dwelling units could have been built on the land that NAMA sold to property vultures, speculators and so on but only 2,000 units were delivered.  It is not just the left that is saying this.  Even Brendan McDonagh from NAMA has said there is a hoarding problem.  <\/p> <p> The Government's measures have actually increased the profits, land values and property prices but have done nothing to force the pace of construction.  The Part V requirement was reduced to 10%.  When the Government initially announced LIHAF funding, we were told it would lead to 40% affordable housing, a figure that disappeared within a few weeks.  Two years later, no affordable housing is being delivered and the Minister even refuses to define what affordable housing is.  I believe the reason for that is because the private developers know that if the Government introduced a meaningful definition of \"affordable\", which was genuinely affordable, it would impact on the ability of the private investors and developers to make profits on those sites.  That is why the Minister is not doing so.  The Minister has supported changes to regulations regarding single aspect homes, no parking spaces, changes in capital gains tax, changes in building heights, all of which simply inflates land and property values to the benefit of the speculators but does nothing to deliver public and affordable housing.  <\/p> <p> In this motion, we propose measures to deal with that.  First, the Government needs to build social and affordable housing on public land, then it needs to pursue an aggressive strategy to go after vacant sites and empty property.  It must resource local authorities to do so and give them the power to use compulsory purchase orders to do so.  It must change the Part V requirements in order that we get land for the local authorities to build on rather than leaving it in the hands of private developers to speculate.  Finally, NAMA's mandate must be changed immediately.  There should be no question of it selling off more land to vultures and investors but instead, NAMA should build directly on that land to provide public and affordable housing units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300030#HH00700","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528898400,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputy Paul Murphy.<\/p>  <p>The motion states the central pillar of any Government policy must prioritise a decisive shift towards the direct provision of public and affordable housing on public land rather than the current reliance on private sector solutions&rdquo;.  Such is the scale of the housing crisis and the speed with which it continues to spiral out of control that we need an emergency programme of public house building to build homes for the many tens of thousands of people who long to have a secure and affordable home.  This can be done.  New data published this week show that local authorities and NAMA between them own enough zoned residential land to build 114,000 homes.  They own three quarters of all residential zoned land in Dublin city, where the greatest crisis is, which is enough to build 71,000 homes.  That is local authority and NAMA-owned land, zoned for residential purposes and ready for development.  We know from figures recently provided by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that one-bedroom homes can be built for just &euro;144,000 while two-bedroom, three-bedroom and four-bedroom units can be built for between &euro;150,000 and &euro;158,000, &euro;167,000 and &euro;177,000, respectively.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, Solidarity has brought forward costed plans for public and affordable housing in a number of local areas.  In my constituency of Dublin West, we proposed Damastown as a social and affordable project and did the same in respect of Kilcarberry in South Dublin County Council and at the Old Whitechurch Road in Cork city.  Solidarity has also explained the various tax raising measures that can be taken to raise the required investment expenditure to the Minister many times.  That is without mentioning the Apple revenue.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government prefers to protect the financially unsustainable and morally indefensible tax haven status that it and a succession of its predecessors have created over decades.  However, the Government is not alone in its moral bankruptcy, it is an international phenomenon.  Overnight, we learned that a very modest tax proposed in Seattle to fund housing for the homeless has been crushed by a combination of Amazon, one of the world's largest companies, and its political allies in the Democratic Party.  Like the Government, these people think that the interests of corporations must always come before the interests of the 99% and even of the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p>  <p>  We know that we own the land and that the land is already zoned for residential purposes.  We know that homes can be built at a cost that ensures rents and prices for the completed homes can be affordable for all and we know that the revenue to fund the construction works can be raised.  All the component parts required to provide the public housing solutions for which young people and families are crying out are available with one exception, namely, political will.  It is not a political priority.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, under the Minister's watch, the number of homes built for local authorities came to a grand total of 235 across the four Dublin local authority areas.  The Minister's failure could hardly be more complete.  He continues with his ideologically-driven commitment to market-based pro-landlord policies.  A year ago, the Minister said of Rebuilding Ireland that it had \"already achieved a great deal with more good things to come\".  He continued by noting \"We&rsquo;re going to have to keep on driving this but I think we can meet our target soon.&rdquo;  Can the Minister tell us which target he has in mind?  If he has a target for creating misery, he has well surpassed it.  <\/p>  <p>Rebuilding Ireland has been exposed as the longest love letter to landlords ever written.  Billions of euro in public money have been poured into their pockets under the guise of housing policy initiatives, all of which have failed for ordinary people, exactly as we said they would.  Who pays for the Minister's commitment to neoliberalism, to landlordism and to developers?  It is the 10,000 people in emergency accommodation who pay, including 3,000 children.  It is the 800,000 people living in rental accommodation who pay through ruinously expensive rent and it is the more than half a million young adults forced to live with their parents who pay.  The crisis is deepening and young people and families are suffering.  Many of them are just one rent increase away from losing their home.  We need public housing now.<\/p>  <p>  The building of public housing on a large scale will be the main pillar of the solution to the housing crisis.  As the motion states, there are perhaps 180,000 or more empty residential units in the country but the number of vacant properties that have been returned to use as homes is pitiful.  Only 416 houses returned to local authorities in 2016 and 2017.  The motion also calls for a change to NAMA&rsquo;s mandate to make it a vehicle for public and affordable housing, which should have been done from the outset but which now should be done today.<\/p><p>These much-needed measures need to be taken to bring a significant number of vacant properties into use as homes, which can supplement essential public house building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300031#JJ00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528899000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>We are now a year into the reign of the Taoiseach.  The approach to the housing crisis demonstrated by his Government perfectly encapsulates its approach generally.  There are two key elements and sides to the Government of Deputy Varadkar.  On one side is a vicious, neoliberal, anti-working class policy that rhetorically demonises and economically attacks working class communities while, on the other, is an extensive spin operation to hide that reality.  Housing sums this up.  Plan after plan has been unveiled multiple times and to much fanfare.  Each one has rested upon the idea of incentivising private developers or landlords to provide housing by funnelling more money in their direction and resolutely refuses to break with neoliberal ideology by investing in building public homes on public land, which has had the consequence of the housing crisis worsening daily.  The response of the Government under the Taoiseach's chief ally, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is not to resolve the housing crisis by reducing the number of people who are homeless through getting them into homes but instead to juke the statistics.  It sums up the approach of the Government: neoliberalism on the one hand and, on the other, extensive spin to try to hide the reality of what is taking place.  Unfortunately for the Government, people are living in this reality and they see right through the spin.<\/p><p>There are many different victims of the Government's policy of putting landlord and developer profits before people's need for housing but particular groups are more adversely affected.  These include working class people, low-paid people, migrants, Travellers and women.  However, I would like to focus on young people.  The statistics from the most recent census are stark.  In 1991, the age at which the majority of people were homeowners was 26; in 2016, it was 35.  In 1991, the age at which two thirds were homeowners was 28; in 2016 that became 41.  That census highlighted that more than 450,000 adults were living at home with parents as well as the massive increases in rents.  These figures are significantly behind the current pace, with rent increases of approximately 60% over the past five years.  Behind those statistics is a human tale of young people who are unable to access secure housing and who are living in precarious and insecure housing conditions with all the consequential impacts on physical and mental health, living conditions, working conditions and so on.<\/p><p>I will refer to a particular cohort of young people, which is students.  Many thousands are doing their leaving certificate examinations today.  In September and October, many will move on to third level education away from home.  However, they are now facing a scenario where all the student accommodation under construction is being built by private developers and offered at full market rates.  Student accommodation is increasingly unaffordable.  There was the phenomenon of DCU students' union being forced to campaign against what was called the &quot;Shanowen shakedown&quot; in which the cost of student accommodation increased from &euro;7,000 per year to &euro;9,000 per year in one year.  <\/p><p>A DIT campus survey shows that average rent is &euro;541 per month for students, with many paying more.  The figure last year was &euro;508.  The consequence of all of that, which DIT points to, is the phenomenon of commuter students - students travelling long distances because it makes economic sense - and all of the associated impacts in terms of their academic and college lives and the impact on the college and third level institutions as a whole.  At the worst extreme, there is the growing phenomenon of students living in cars to access third level accommodation.  These are the conditions into which they are being put.  There is no alternative on offer.<\/p><p>What situation are they in after they finish third level or if, perhaps, they do not go on to third level?  In most cases, because of the conditions of precarious work and low pay which the Government also encourages, they are trapped at home.  They become part of that 500,000 young people who are trapped at home or perhaps, if they are lucky, they may be in a job that is paid well enough to allow them to get into the rented sector, where conditions are also precarious.  They face all the consequences of the precarious nature of the private rental sector as a result of the policies pursued by the Government.<\/p><p>I would like to address a number of the myths that have been popularised in respect of these issues.  When reference was made to forced emigration, the previous Taoiseach regularly used to talk about how young people enjoy travelling.  He suggested that is why they were going abroad in the context of mass unemployment.  We are now subject to a similar patronising view regarding people's living conditions and working conditions.  It is suggested that young people do not mind being in precarious housing or precarious work.  They are forced into this as a result of the policies of the Government and the free market system it defends.  The other contemporary myth is the reports from <i>daft.ie<\/i>on rocketing rents year-on-year and month-on-month suggest are only a partial snapshot because in reality many people are accessing housing through social media and so on.  Many young people are forced to access housing outside of the regular traditional channels and, because of the demand for housing, landlords do not feel the need to go through <i>daft.ie<\/i>or whatever.  However, they capture the reality that rents are absolutely rocketing.  That is a truth that cannot be denied and no one should attempt to hide behind that idea.<\/p><p>There is, however, an alternative.  When we talk about social and affordable housing and public building programmes, we refer to programmes that are precisely aimed at catering for the needs of young people in their 20s and 30s and aimed at student accommodation, which should be publicly built.  The mortgage and private ownership model is failing young people because capitalism, on the one hand, wants people to pay a massive price to access what should be a basic right to housing, while, on the other hand, it pays people less and gives them less for their work.  The answer here is public housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300032#KK00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1528899000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann notes&quot;

that a suite of measures is being implemented to facilitate increased residential construction activity and ensure the sector&rsquo;s capacity to produce more affordable homes through, <i>inter alia<\/i>:<blockquote>&mdash; fast-track planning reforms and more flexible planning guidelines;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; &euro;200 million capital investment in enabling infrastructure to service\/open up housing lands with proportionate affordability dividends for house purchasers;

Rebuilding Ireland is the response to that, but as we build more homes we have to make sure that, as they are built, we do not make the mistakes of the past because we are building a home for a person's life and for at least 60 years.  If one is going to build, one has to make sure that one avoids the mistakes we made in the past, including building where there is no demand for houses; building where there are no infrastructural connections or services; building where there are no local amenities; building in a way that is not compact spatially and which causes sprawl and all the additional problems that come with it; or building without considering that we are building more than just buildings, but communities as well.  For that reason, mixed tenure will be important as we build into the future.  <\/p><p>We have to build in the right way and that is a challenge even in the normal course of events.  However, we did not experience normal course of events following the collapse of the economy and the construction sector in the years 2007 to 2011.  Construction in the economy fell by 90%, and house prices fell by 50% and continued to fall into 2012.  That is why we stood down the affordability scheme.  In that year, and the years after, affordability was not an issue.  Hundreds of thousands of people fell into negative equity.  Many continue to be in negative equity, despite recent house price inflation.  We are still 20% to 23% off the peak of house prices in the past and while the latest information is that house prices are increasing, there was a dramatic slowdown in the first quarter of this year.<\/p><p>If that trend continues, we will see single-digit inflation in the course of 2018.  Employment in the construction sector had fallen by two thirds, with a legacy of 3,000 ghost estates.  Local authorities were saddled with large land debts.  This was the legacy that we inherited.  It was what we had to turn around and it is what we are turning around.<br\/><br\/>In 2012, house affordability was not an issue.  Negative equity and ghost estates were the issue.  We needed social housing then but it had almost exclusively been outsourced to the private sector through the Part V process.  That collapsed as well.  Getting local authorities back into house building would take time but social house building, looking after the most vulnerable, was our first priority.<br\/><br\/>From almost a standing start with a very low base of delivery in 2013 and 2014, the Government increased the delivery of new-build social houses, with 664 having been built in 2016 and 2,297 last year.  The number is expected to rise to 4,409 this year.  This increase was because I took the decision last year to build 30% more in 2018 to expand supply rather than compete from existing supply for the new social housing homes.  When one includes homes acquired on long-term leases, the figure rises to 7,900 new homes in 2018.  I refer to real homes for real people.<br\/><br\/>Social housing is not delivered like it was 30 years ago.  New technologies and new streams that complement each other are being used to deliver social housing homes into the stock of social housing and each home is a real home.<br\/><br\/>Almost 27,000 tenancies will be supported in 2018 through these new homes and through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme.  I would not have chosen to rely on HAP so much but, until new homes are built, we have to.  Otherwise these people would have no homes.  In 2020 and 2021, the final two years of Rebuilding Ireland, we will house more people in social housing homes than in the HAP-supported private rental sector.  Therefore, we are progressively rebalancing the social housing stock back towards new-build homes - public housing delivered by the State.<br\/><br\/>By the end of the period of Rebuilding Ireland, 50,000 new homes &mdash; real homes &ndash; will have been added to the stock of social housing.  This is thanks to an additional &euro;0.5 billion that I secured last year, meaning we have a war chest of some &euro;6 billion in taxpayers' money ring-fenced to build social housing directly as a State into the future.  Under Project Ireland 2040, we will deliver almost 12,000 new social housing homes a year to 2027 at least.<br\/><br\/>This is what we are doing for social housing supply.  One cannot spin these improvements negatively, even though people will try.  We are going to double the number of new homes built this year.  This is public money going into public housing.  That is going to make a real difference for thousands of families, as it did last year and as it will again this year.<br\/><br\/>Vacancy is an important tool but it is not the low-hanging fruit people think it is.  The repair and lease scheme, in its first iteration, is proof of that.  The buy and renew scheme has proven more successful.  People will say we have not got a strategy because we have not published it but, of course, if I did publish one, Members would then say I was just making announcements and not doing the actual work.  The work is being done, however.  There is a vacant homes unit in the Department and there are vacant homes officers and teams in local authorities.  <i>Vacanthomes.ie<\/i>helps the public to identify potential vacant properties.  There are new laws in place to tackle vacancy over the shop.  There are new incentives to put vacant units back into use, and CPO powers are being used by local authorities.  There are not 180,000 vacant homes to be put back into use, probably not even 10% of that number.  We have, however, brought approximately 9,000 social council houses that were vacant back into use since 2014.  All are homes for families and individuals to live in.<br\/><br\/>If the ESB figure is massively overstated in regard to new builds, it must be associated with vacant units coming back into use that were not connected for two years or more.  Either way, it is new homes being brought back into supply.<br\/><br\/>Of course, social housing is only one part of the supply issue we face.  Management of the existing stock is the other.  The private market needs to be rebuilt also.  Therefore, we have the new fast-track planning process, which has proven its worth over the past year, with almost 3,000 residential homes being approved through it.  More than 3,000 student bed spaces were made available - that was only to April of this year.  There are new guidelines to promote the building of more apartments - build-to-rent apartments in addition to co-living apartments.<br\/><br\/>We have LIHAF funding of &euro;200 million to open up land banks to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 new homes by 2021.  Home Building Finance Ireland will help small builders throughout the country to build developments with ten units or more.  It will be announced very shortly having gone to Cabinet on Tuesday of this week.  A new national development and regeneration agency will be established under Project Ireland 2040.  The vacant site levy is in place.  Last year, I doubled it for the beginning of next year, which will help with land hoarding.  By the beginning of 2017 the labour force in construction had increased by least 14%.  All these measures have helped to increase the supply of housing and they are working.<br\/><br\/>Planning permissions were up 27% in 2017 by comparison with 2016.  Over 18,000 new homes were on site in the past 12 months, up 27% on the previous 12 months.  There were just under 20,000 new electricity connections.  Vacant or not, these are homes that were not being used by families or individuals but which have been used in the past 12 months.  The Central Bank of Ireland is forecasting 23,000 new homes this year and 27,000 new homes next year.  Registrations for larger schemes are up 41% on the previous 12 months from March 2017.  These figures cannot be disputed.  While there is a dispute over the actual build achieved in any given year, I did mandate work last year to make sure we could get a more accurate figure.  That work will be completed very shortly.<br\/><br\/>The supply of social housing and private housing is increasing dramatically.  When we consider rents and house prices, particularly in Dublin, affordability is a serious issue.  It is a serious and genuine concern of the Government.  The recent rent index for quarter one from the RTB is welcome.  What we are seeing is a dramatic slowdown in rent price increases from one quarter to the next.  There is 0.4% rent inflation nationally and 1% rent inflation in Dublin.  It was 1.1% in the previous quarter.  Perhaps more significantly, we saw a drop in rents in counties surrounding Dublin, namely Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.<br\/><br\/>In practical terms, the average rent for a house in Dublin rose by &euro;1 in the past three months, while the average rent for an apartment in Dublin rose by approximately &euro;18.  Rents are still too high in almost every part of the country, but particularly in the cities and larger urban centres.  The data show that rent pressure zones are working and we will continue to drive them, but they need to be strengthened.  More legislation is coming to bring more transparency, accountability and affordability to the rental sector.  That will be a central focus of my work over the coming weeks as we seek to strengthen rent pressure zones, the RTB and the rental sector in general.<br\/><br\/>A lot of progress has been made towards introducing the first cost-rental project of scale in one of our cities.  Cost rental will become a major part of our rental landscape in the future.  Of course, affordability still remains a big problem when buying, particularly in our cities.  That is why, in the coming days, I will recommence the affordability Act in line with the commitment made at the beginning of the year.  I issued a call to local authorities for local authority land for the serviced sites fund for affordable housing, which amounts to at least &euro;25 million.  It may be increased.  This will work in tandem with the affordability commitments that have already been given for sites such as those at O'Devaney Gardens and Poolbeg.  Affordability has already been achieved, as under the &Oacute; Cualann model, between the State, through Dublin City Council, and an approved housing body.  We are now going to do this at scale.  These provisions will allow for the new affordable purchase scheme, which was also signalled earlier in the year.  In this regard, we have identified land and finance for 4,000 affordable homes, with an additional 10,000 homes to come on local authority land alone.<br\/><br\/>In February of this year, I launched a new Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which is the new affordable home loan for first-time buyers to access 2% finance for 25 years, offering real certainty of mortgage repayments.  It is estimated that this first tranche will provide 1,000 loans to give people who have deposits the opportunity to buy a home and who have been squeezed out of the market because of mortgage affordability.  Over 50% of all applicants to date, including 61% of applicants in May 2018, are being approved for this new loan by the Housing Agency.  It is worth noting that in the 12 months up to October last year, 67% of first-time buyers in the greater Dublin area, Cork and Galway purchased their homes for less than &euro;320,000.  In the rest of the country, 90% of people purchase their homes for less than &euro;250,000.  Clearly, however, affordability is an issue in our larger cities.  These measures will tackle it.<br\/><br\/>When it comes to people who are sleeping rough on our streets, even though the number is down 40% to just over 100 people, it is still too many.  Words about supply and words about protections in the rental sector are cold comfort.  We have increased our supports for outreach teams.  Through the cold weather initiative, we dramatically increased the number of beds and successfully brought more people into the system.  The system of emergency accommodation is operated to the highest standards with our partner NGO organisations, which operate it with taxpayer funding on behalf of the State.  There are more than 9,000 people in emergency accommodation, including 1,700 or more families.  That is a crisis.  It is my first and highest priority.  Two reports are imminent and will detail new policy responses that are needed.  We will get a chance to debate them in the Oireachtas committee next week.  There is still a significant number of families in hotels and B&amp;amp;Bs.  One family is one too many.  Last year, more than 2,000 families exited hotels and B&amp;amp;Bs, the majority into homes.<br\/><br\/>We have more than 500 family spaces under our new hub programme, with 450 more to come throughout the rest of the year.  The time a family spends in a family hub is dramatically less than that spent in a hotel.  Presentations in Dublin have stabilised, according to the Dublin authorities.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the motion, of course I recognise there is more work to do.  If we are to be successful as an Oireachtas in improving what we are doing when we introduce legislation to improve and strengthen the rental sector, we have to recognise the great gains that have already been made while of course recognising there is more work to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300032#KK00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528899600,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Darragh O'Brien.

I am assuming I will get the extra minute that the Minister got.  Ar aon n&oacute;s, what is occurring is actually quite disheartening.  While I welcome aspects of the motion, I am puzzled somewhat as to why its proposers saw fit to vote against the Fianna F&aacute;il motion on 17 May, which was establishing an affordable housing scheme based on the very parameters mentioned in this Private Members' motion.  Having said that, there are aspects of the motion that I welcome and that I believe we could work with.<\/p><p> It is disheartening to come in here every couple of weeks to have more debates on housing, which is crucial.  It is like ground-hog day.  The Minister's contribution is not rooted in reality; it is rooted in fantasy.<\/p> <p> Some Members spoke about obtaining private land by way of compulsory purchase order, CPO.  That may be part of the solution in terms of using a stick to acquire vacant homes but the State is the most guilty party for not using State owned land.  We have 3,008 ha of State owned land that can deliver 114,000 homes for people.<\/p> <p> Earlier this week I visited Dublin Central with my colleague, Mary Fitzpatrick.  We went to O'Devaney Gardens, which the Minister mentioned.  It is a 14 acre prime urban site less than 1 km from O'Connell Street that is zoned and serviced for housing.  It has all the facilities including a frequent bus service and a Luas service.  It is within walking distance of Heuston Station and the Phoenix Park on the way into town.  In December 2016, the Government promised &euro;17.9 million to build 56 units on a site that used to accommodate more than 600 families.  In 2016, the Government said that this was the most important housing development in the country.  In 2016, O'Devaney Gardens was the most important housing development in Rebuilding Ireland.  It was to be the Government's flagship housing development under its much quoted Rebuilding Ireland.  When I visited this week with Mary Fitzpatrick, more than two years on from the announcement made by the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister's predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, there were no new homes, no children playing, no builders, no diggers, no hoarding and no construction.  There was nothing.<\/p> <p> Down the road from that the Magdalen laundry site in Sean MacDermott Street is another example of the State's lack of commitment and ambition to deliver affordable homes.  It is a 2 acre site less than half a kilometre from O'Connell Street which transferred from private ownership to the State as a form of compensation.  What is happening with it now?  Dublin City Council, DCC, is proposing to sell this valuable State owned land which is zoned and serviced for housing because the Government has failed to provide an affordable housing scheme.<\/p> <p> The day after I moved our motion on establishing an affordable housing scheme on 17 May, the Minister came into the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and said he would commence an affordable housing scheme.  He has said again that he will do that but when will he do it?  When will the regulations come in?  How long will we have to wait?<\/p> <p> I visited another part of Dublin, Ballymun, recently with a colleague of mine, Councillor Paul McAuliffe.  The Minister mentioned &Oacute; Cualann.  I met with representatives of &Oacute; Cualann and saw vast acres of other serviced land owned by the State that is not developed.  More than 700 homes were to be built on the Oscar Traynor Road site in Santry but what have we done?  We have asked for expressions of interest but there has not been any building on the site.<\/p> <p> When we came back into Dublin Central Mary Fitzpatrick showed me State owned property.  I want to deal with that element when we talk about refurbishment and putting accommodation back in.  I went to Constitution Hill flats, St. Mary's Place on Dorset Street, Matt Talbot Court in Summerhill, St. Finbarr's Court in Cabra and Dominick Street flats, all of which began to be de-tenanted about ten years ago for refurbishment.  The city council tells me it has not been given any money from central Government to refurbish those properties.  I saw hundreds of units boarded up on Monday of this week.  I saw ten, 12 or 14 apartments boarded up on the first floor.  On the second floor I met families whose adult children and their grandchildren are living in those flats while walking past empty units owned by the State that we can control and do something about that.  It beggars belief that we are here talking about this issue again when we cannot even get our act together in terms of the properties we own.  It is a scandal.<\/p> <p> We went to the Herbert Simms designed flats in Chancery House, which are in a brilliant location and fully serviced.  The council staff came up and repainted them but has the Minister seen the state of the inside of the flats?  I met families who are dealing with condensation, and we are doing nothing about that.<\/p> <p> The purpose of this motion, which I welcome and to which I have tabled an amendment on behalf of my party, is to get something moving on this issue because nothing is happening.  The Minister's contribution earlier was not grounded in fact.  It was absolute fantasy.  He said the social and affordable housing supply is being dramatically increased.  Is he kidding me?  We built 396 houses last year and he bought the rest.  We are failing on this issue.  We need to work together as an Oireachtas to start building homes and stop people falling into homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300033#LL01000","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528900200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>In the few words to us earlier, the Minister said there was more to building these houses than clicking one's fingers.

Apart from that, there were six separate plans excluding the other numerous relaunches.  That was what the Strategic Communications Unit, SCU, was up to.  It was trying to give the people the impression that the Minister was doing something about this issue and it worked with some.<\/p>  <p>  People are in crisis, not only in the city but throughout this country.

She has an income of &euro;26,000.  She cannot qualify for council housing or a loan.  She is being hopped around renting accommodation and when the landlord feels like it, she is pushed out of it.

In particular, vulnerable people - older people, single people and carers - are being priced out of the market.  Housing prices are ballooning.  Ordinary people are priced out of the market and working families cannot afford to buy a home.  We were warned in 2012 that this would happen.  When I was a candidate in the county council election in 2014 I was told by Government councillors to stop complaining, that it takes a year or two to build houses and that it would be done.  It is now 2018 and houses are still not being built.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address three bugbears of mine, one of which is the family income supplement, FIS.  If someone wants to go on the housing list, FIS is deemed as an income and therefore many families are over the threshold and cannot get on the housing list.  For someone who wants to get a council mortgage, FIS is deemed as a social welfare support and they cannot get a council mortgage.  The Government should make up its mind up one way or the other.

Those quotes are coming in now at &euro;16,000 and &euro;18,000.  Unfortunately, that is the going rate, and engineers will say that.  If a bathroom needs to be adapted for someone with dementia and their carer is on an invalidity pension, that &euro;10,000 of a difference may as well be &euro;1 million.  They cannot get it.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing the &euro;6,000 maximum amount.  He might put it as a percentage similar to the housing adaption grant.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lack of apprenticeships.

He certainly is not codding people on the ever increasing and expanding housing lists.  There is a deplorable record in providing social housing units.  The lack of affordable private housing is pushing an increasing number of people onto the housing lists and into homelessness.  According to the latest figures for Louth, there were 124 people in emergency accommodation in April.  In addition, the current high price of housing reflects a substantial shortage of housing units.  Irish building firms are engaged in building large apartment blocks for international fund management companies as the return on investment is high owing to increased rent year on year.  Until our indigenous building firms go back to providing affordable housing, with the backing of the State-owned banks, we will not see an increase in the number of houses available for purchase by the ordinary, hard-working people of the country.<\/p>  <p>  While the Taoiseach has lauded my local authority, Louth County Council, for its record with compulsory purchase orders and bringing vacant units back into use, there are still 4,506 families on Louth County Council's housing list seeking housing.  That is a total of people on the housing list and people availing of HAP.  Louth County Council is proposing to build 850 housing units over a three-year period.  When one calculates the housing waiting list figures per annum one quickly discovers that where the period of waiting on the housing list used to be eight to ten years in Louth, people going on that housing list today will be waiting for 16 years.

The opportunity to live in a family home, where one has protections and rights, has been a fundamental right in our society for generations.  A Government that does not honour this fundamental right will ultimately fail its people.  By any yardstick, the past two Fine Gael-led Governments have failed the people in terms of the provision of a working housing policy.  Families are suffering as a result.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has a responsibility to create a number of housing options but he has failed to do so.  He has a responsibility to create a social housing policy that can be implemented by local authorities whereby low-income families can get a house appropriate to their needs at a rent appropriate to their income.  This has not happened.  Our local housing authorities, the county councils, have been turned into a giant administrative bureaucracy to distribute money from the Government to the private rental sector.  Couples whose incomes are not high enough to allow them to engage with the retail banks have been offered Rebuilding Ireland, which is so badly funded and full of so much red tape it will never address the housing needs of the specific demographic for which it was intended.  Worse still, it is sending those young couples to a lifetime of housing uncertainty in the private rental sector.  Couples whose incomes allow them to source a mortgage with the high street banks are at the mercy of an inflated market, due to the lack of housing supply.  The Government must accept full responsibility for that.<\/p>  <p>  The final failure of this Government's housing policy is the manner in which it has allowed the banks to ride roughshod over families in mortgage arrears.  The banks have no plan other than repossession or to sell distressed mortgages at a knock-down price to the vulture funds.  The same banks trousered billions of euro from the bailout provided to them by Irish taxpayers a few short years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300035#NN00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1528900800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The Minister said that this is a complex issue that requires many different solutions.

This applied to families who had inherited a property from a family member but the property was not fit to live in.  The local authority would do up the house, the family on the housing list would occupy it and over a period of five, ten, 15 or 20 years they would repay the money that was spent on refurbishing the house.  That solved a problem for that family.  To my knowledge that scheme has been dormant for at least eight years.  I ask the Minister to reintroduce it immediately as it would get a number of families off the list, particularly in my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is that, according to the latest local property tax register, there are over 400 estates where property tax is not being paid because they are unfinished and require work to be done on them.  There are probably a number of unoccupied properties in all those estates.  My low-water estimate is that there are between 3,000 and 5,000 houses in the country that have been built but have yet to be occupied.  A small level of investment would put those properties on the market.  It is another area where the Minister could get people off the housing list.  The properties are tied up in NAMA, the banks and in distressed mortgages.  I ask the Minister to establish a specific task force in each county to assess the number of those properties and get them occupied immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300035#NN00800","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1528900800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this proposal.  Of course, we are all aware that supply is key.  We are waiting for it to come into the market and that is a major problem.  It is slow, and we must acknowledge that.  If we do, we can try to work together to make it happen more quickly.  However, there are issues we can deal with immediately.  I have been in contact with the Minister's office on a number of them.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP and rent supplement payments are causing homelessness.  The Minister said that rents have increased by 0.4% in Kildare.  The problem is that the rent for a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Kildare is &euro;1,500 and the HAP payment for the family unit to accommodate the house is approximately &euro;1,250, so there is a gap.  The family has a choice, either to remain homeless or to get supports from their family to acquire the house.  When they bring the letters of guarantee from family members to support them in getting off the street they are not accepted by the local authority under the Department's guidelines.  That means they remain homeless.  These are issues that could be dealt with immediately to help people in the short term to move from homelessness into a temporary home.<\/p>  <p>  We know people on the social housing lists are not being offered houses because there are few available.  However, what about people who do not qualify to go on the social housing list?  They are marginally outside it because of means.  They are in no man's land.  They want to provide for themselves but they are unable to access credit or funds to purchase a house.  The home loan the Minister mentioned is not working.  Statistics show there is a very slow uptake of it and very few approvals.<\/p>  <p>  Development of local authority land is key.  The local authorities own large landbanks in my county and other counties that could help to deliver affordable housing.  The local authorities already own the land and the Government could borrow on the European markets at a little over 0%.  That would contribute to bringing down the cost of the houses.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make a final point.  The reason the private sector is slow is because of the planning process, which the Minister suggests is helping and fast-tracking it.<\/p><p>I have spoken to people in the private sector and if they are applying to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for more than 100 units it is taking 14 months from start to finish.  I can prove that and give the Minister the statistics to back it up.  They are also having difficulty accessing credit.<\/p> <p> The Minister knows that LIHAF is slow and not working.  He knows it is not providing the funding for the land that needs to be opened up for development.  We have proof of that in my constituency of Kildare North and it is true nationally.  It is not working and not delivering at the rate intended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300035#NN00900","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528901400,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Adams.<\/p>  <p>  I warmly welcome the People Before Profit motion, which we are enthusiastically supporting.<\/p>  <p>  I am running out of adjectives to describe the Minister's speeches to the House.  I do not say that to be in any way personal.  The gap between what the Minister is telling us week in and week out and the reality we are all experiencing in our constituencies is growing ever greater.  Let us consider his record.  Homelessness has increased consistently since he took office.  Child homelessness has increased by a shocking 27% while pensioner homelessness has increased by a shocking 32%.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is wrong in his interpretation of the RTB figures.  The board does not agree with him, based on its presentation to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government yesterday.  Throughout the State rents have increased by 7.1% in the past year.  In Dublin, they have increased by 7.8% in the past year.  The 4% cap that applies to Dublin, Galway, Cork, etc. is, therefore, not working.  There is no evidence for the Minister to base his comments on quarterly interpretations.  The rent cap applies for a year and those caps are being breached right across the country, either because the exemptions are too generous or because people are breaking the rules.  The Minister is due to bring legislation before the House which we will support because it will give the RTB more powers of enforcement.  However, the Minister would do himself and the rest of us a favour if he correctly interpreted his own agency's figures.<\/p>  <p>  While we can dispute the figures, I accept there is an increase in housing supply, but it is not reducing cost.  There is no evidence that prices for houses in high-demand areas are reducing.  How many affordable homes has the Minister or his predecessor delivered through Government schemes in two years?  The answer is \"zero\".  I do not dispute that the supply of social housing is increasing, but the rate remains glacial.  Funding is not sufficient, bureaucracy is still far too great and there is a chronic over-reliance on the private sector to the tune of 70% of social housing delivery over the course of the Government's plan - those are the Minister's figures, not mine.  The Minister will be 12 months in office tomorrow and circumstances are much worse for thousands of families now.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to focus on one of the important parts of the motion, which is vacant homes.  It has slightly slipped off our radar in housing discussions, which is a mistake.  The first line on the Rebuilding Ireland website refers to 183,000 vacant homes, according to the CSO.  I accept the Minister is right; there are not 183,000 vacant homes.  GeoDirectory has put the figure at 96,000 and the Minister has said it might be only 10% of the original figure, which would be 18,000.  We do not know how many, but we know there are a lot.<\/p>  <p>  How many homes has the Government brought back into use from that stock?  Based on the reply to the most recent parliamentary question, we know through repair and leasing the number of tenancies created is nine.  We know that from build and renew the total is approximately 70.  Of the purchases from the Housing Agency, it is about 400.  This means that less than 500 homes from the 18,000, 96,000 or 183,000 have been brought into play in the past two years.  Those statistics speak volumes about the Government's failure.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is also disingenuous to suggest that we are wrong to criticise him for not publishing the strategy.  His predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, had it almost finished.  It was on the Minister's desk.  We all made submissions with constructive suggestions, but we have never seen it.  I suspect we have never seen it because if the Minister published a strategy, we could then hold him to account for his failure to implement it.<\/p>  <p>  We need to see clear targets for every local authority to bring vacant homes back into use, whatever the number.  We need dedicated officers in every local authority.  Some have them; some do not but they are required.  We need a register of vacant properties held by local authorities so that people know the number of properties in their area and clear action plans with greater funding than has been provided to date.  We also need a vacant-home tax for those, including banks, who have been wilfully and speculatively sitting on vacant properties and not to punish families in the fair deal scheme or stuck in probate.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the proposal to increase the Part V requirements.  I fully support the critique and proposed changes to LIHAF.  I warmly welcome the renewed call to amend the NAMA mandate.  Without those changes, we will never achieve the level of affordability required.  I support the motion and I urge the Minister to at least publish the strategy on vacant homes he claims to have so that we can start to see if it is delivering anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300036#OO00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1528901400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>A home is pivotal for the well-being of a family.

For years Fine Gael has been allergic to State investment in housing.  Fine Gael has radically distorted the housing market by the introduction of unfair tax incentives to vulture funds and to international landlords.  Of course, for years Fine Gael has had a policy of inertia when it comes to dealing with landowners sitting on vacant properties.<\/p>  <p>  However, it gets worse.  In the middle of the most grievous housing crisis in generations, the Government is one of the largest owners of vacant properties, and is doing precious little to resolve it.  Three years ago I tabled a parliamentary question to all Departments and State agencies.  I discovered that they are presiding over thousands of acres of vacant land and buildings totalling 155,000 sq. ft owned by the Government were standing idle.  These are not lands owned by NAMA or other development agencies.

Child homelessness has increased by 7% under Fine Gael-led governments.  Almost 150,000 people are on waiting lists with thousands more, including students, paying unaffordable rents.

The number of social houses to be delivered this year will be lower than last year.<\/p> <p> The purpose of this motion is to set out a plan to bring vacant homes back into use.  In my constituency, Louth County Council has rightly acquired vacant homes through compulsory purchase orders, on which I commend it.  The Government promised to bring forward a vacant homes strategy but ten months later there is still not sign of it.  There are currently 124 people in emergency accommodation in Louth.  Approximately 8% of houses in Louth council areas are vacant.

The Labour Party supports the motion.  Almost every week when debating Private Members' motions, I and others have mentioned the land in State ownership on which social and affordable houses could be built immediately .  I have often mentioned that there are over 700 sites in public ownership.  The motion states that there are 1,317 hectares of zoned residential land with a capacity for 48,724 dwellings.  As we speak, Government policy is to use most of that land for private development for private profit. Only a fraction of these sites are to be used for social and affordable housing.  There is a fundamental difference between the policy of Government in regard to this valuable land in State ownership and the views of members on this side of the House.  As we speak, these sites are being parcelled out for profit.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard previously from the Minister that this is about mixed tenure.  Social and affordable housing is mixed tenure.  People who are buying or renting affordable homes are people who have jobs but earning low to middle incomes, which is valuable mixed tenure.  We need to provide homes for those people who are being priced out of the purchase market, because they cannot afford deposits or obtain mortgages, and rental market, as a result of rent hikes.  It is urgent that the Minister listens to what people have to say and also that this particular part of the motion becomes public policy.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us were at the meeting earlier with the representatives of St. Michael's Estate who are arguing for a piece of land in their area to be utilised in this way.  What is happening is a shame.  The owners of the private sites are sitting on them waiting for them to rise in value so they can make more profit at a later stage and at the same time jumping into the publicly owned sites to make profit right now.  This is unacceptable.  The Government needs to address land hoarding via the types of measures many of us have put forward.  The Labour Party has specifically argued for implementation of the Kenny report, which would deter land hoarding, and for the vacant sites levy to be brought forward and increased.  It is wrong that public land is being used for private profit while at the time those who own private land are sitting on it.  In my opinion, this is the most important issue.<\/p>  <p>  Others have spoken about the need for measures in regard to vacant homes, of which there are approximately 183,000.  I recently tabled some parliamentary questions on the number of vacant home officers that are in place in local authorities.  As I understand it, the staff engaged in this work also perform other duties within the council.  In other words, vacant home officers are staff already working in the housing section of the council who are assigned this work on top of other duties.  What is proposed in the motion, which I support, is the appointment of staff whose specific job it would be to identify vacant homes in their electoral areas, to find out the reason they are vacant and to go after them by applying, if necessary, a vacant homes tax or utilising compulsory purchase orders.  This has been working well in Britain.  There are models that are effective.  It is a sop to the idea of vacant homes officers that we are giving this duty to staff in local authorities who are already overburdened with work.  There are many vacant homes.  The voids scheme, which I commenced during my time as Minister, is delivering local authority vacant homes.  Given the scale of the current housing problem, we now need to take ownership of privately-owned vacant homes so that people can live in them.<\/p>  <p>  Others mentioned rent increases.  As I have mentioned previously, Limerick is outside the rent pressure zone, as, I think, is the area represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, yet there was a 10% increase in rents in Limerick last year, which is much higher than the average increase nationally.  Earlier this week, the issue of amending the Residential Tenancies Board legislation with a view to broadening out rent pressure zones to areas smaller than local electoral areas was discussed by the relevant committee.  The current provision is unfair in a situation whereby a local electoral area includes rural as well as suburban areas.  In this situation, the suburban area where people are paying above the national average is deemed a rent pressure zone but the entire area is not.  I plead with the Minister examine this when reviewing the rent pressure zones.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party has advocated for a change to NAMA's mandate, which I am sure will require legislative change.  I was in the House when the NAMA legislation was brought forward by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  I remember a former Minister of State, Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, speaking on it and saying that NAMA also had a social mandate.  NAMA's economic mandate has superseded its social mandate and the only way to change this is to change the legislation and give it a stronger social mandate.  The economic problem it was designed to solve is pretty much, in economic terms, solved but the social problem is not and this needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities in Dublin cannot afford to buy Part V homes because, at the market rate less a set percentage, the cost is too high.  The proposal that the transfer of land would be preferable to the transfer of homes is an interesting one.  In that situation, the council presumably could build cheaper on the land.  It is worth looking at.  Currently, when developers transfer houses they tend to transfer a small corner of a development such that it is easy to distinguish between social and private houses.  I would not like to worsen that situation because it would be even more obvious which are the social houses and which are the private houses.  Ideally, under Part V the social houses should be spread throughout developments but the reality is that they are not.  There is a real problem with the cost of Part V housing.  I recently met some Labour Party councillors from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown who gave me costings for social housing in the area, which was more than what it would have cost the council to build on its own land.  This problem is well identified in the motion.<\/p>  <p>  I again commend Solidarity-People Before Profit on bringing forward the motion.  I hope the response will be positive.  We have all been critical of the Minister, and rightly so.  What we want is a positive response to what we are proposing in good faith.  I hope our comments will be listened to in a genuine manner and taken on board by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300037#PP00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1528902600,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I support the motion tabled by People Before Profit, acknowledging that it highlights a specific aspect of the empty homes and sites and seeks strategically to place teams in each local authority as a national approach to bringing these empty homes into local authority housing schemes.

If this Government continues to rely on developers to deliver the crumbs off their profitable tables the crisis will continue.<\/p>  <p>  The UN rapporteur on adequate housing, Leilani Farha, who was hosted here on Monday by Threshold and Simon, said the housing crisis is a global phenomenon primarily because of unregulated real estate speculation and commodification making housing unaffordable even for the middle classes.  She said that in developed and developing countries, people are being displaced from their communities.  She gives three reasons for this: national governments have receded from the arena of social housing and social protection; the unprecedented amount of wealth being parked in real estate and the global financial crisis that allowed the predatory buying up of bad debt and hedging, waiting for that bad debt to become lucrative.  She said we must step back and ask how we view housing, as a commodity, something traded and sold on stock markets or as a human right.  She said it should not be viewed as something to be traded on the stock market like gold, steel or wheat but as a human right.  It is enshrined in international human rights law.  Ireland has ratified and signed that law and committed to this human right.  <\/p>  <p>  Even if the Government uses private developers to build some social housing, they should be regulated to comply with human rights legislation but they are not.  It is an ideological issue for the Government not to use public lands for public housing.  St. Michael's Estate offers a great opportunity for a pilot scheme.  I again suggest the Government needs to look in that direction, support that initiative and provide the capital funding in the budget for 2019 to support the scheme with a view to developing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300038#QQ00100","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1528902600,"counter":421,"content":"<p>We have two official languages in this country, Irish and English, but we seem to have a third language, one of denial that there is a housing crisis and of the solutions being put forward.

The Government's over-reliance on the private market and landlords is not working but the Taoiseach and the rest of the Minister of State's colleagues do not seem to care.

It will, however, be a major stumbling block to the Minister of State's re-election and that of many of his colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how many more times colleagues on these benches will implore the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to declare a housing emergency and use emergency powers to compulsorily purchase or lease vacant properties, to build on local authority, or where necessary, private, lands and to reduce rents to affordable levels by imposing serious rent controls linked to the consumer price index, CPI, not the pathetic controls introduced by the last Government and continued by the present Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is simple economics in that developers and landowners are withholding supply to push up prices, as they always have done.  Due to the lack of affordable rental properties, many households are living in dangerous and overcrowded accommodation.  The rental market has become so competitive that there is little hope for people on low incomes or in receipt of State housing supports to acquire such properties.  We need a major change of policy in this regard.  The motion before us sets out a well-thought out roadmap for how we could achieve a sustainable housing market.  We discussed this a few minutes ago at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The delegation from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which was before the committee said that there are exemplars in other European countries but they have different land use policies which we do not have and which we badly need.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300038#QQ00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1528902600,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on housing again in the Chamber.  I raised the matter of rural cottages and demountable homes with the Taoiseach over a week ago and the man had not a clue what I was talking about.  I do not blame him.  He is from Dublin and does not know what is happening or is needed in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Rural cottages have been a way of life in rural Ireland for years, longer than I can remember, since the 1960s.  The person provided the site to the local authority, which built the house for them where they could farm their own land.  When they got on their feet, they bought the house back from the local authority.  <\/p>  <p>  Between 2016 and 2021, ten rural cottages will be built in County Kerry.  There are more than 37 applications but the applicants are being told that they are too far away, it will take too long and the local authority may get them a house in town.  These people are providing the site and if the Government has the money and cannot build these rural cottages, I do not know what is wrong with it.  If it does not have the money it should tell us because we hear the stories of homelessness in urban areas such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other places.  Maybe the Government does not have the money but it should tell us if it does not.  People will understand that.  Ten rural cottages in Kerry is not enough in five years between 2016 and 2021. <\/p><p> Then there are demountable homes.  The Taoiseach did not know about these homes, which are vital in rural areas.  A mobile home is brought in and the person is able to stay on the land where he or she was born, bred and reared.  A circular was sent out to the local authorities saying that a demountable home could only be provided if a person's existing home was burned down or flooded.  The Minister has to get a hold of this.  I am taking up the time of someone else but this is very wrong and the Minister of State will have to look into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300038#QQ00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528903200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the proposers of this motion.  I wish to refer to the tenant purchase scheme.  Every week for five years I asked the Taoiseach to introduce such a scheme.  He, and the Government at the time, brought in a scheme which debars 80% of people from the opportunity to purchase their local authority house.  People may have the money.  If, however, a person's house is valued at &euro;40,000, &euro;60,000, &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 and even if he or she can prove he or she can pay for it outright - from retirement money or life savings in a bank account - he or she cannot purchase it if he or she is not in full-time employment.  I ask that this be changed.  It does not make sense.  It is outrageous to debar 80% of people.  If people are on pensions or other social protection payments, such as disability allowance or unemployment benefit, they are automatically debarred.  That is an outrageous.  If they can have the capacity to pay, they should be allowed to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I support the call to allow single rural cottages to be built, and also that relating to demountable buildings.  The Taoiseach was completely confused by the latter last week or the week before.  He was looking up at the sky and did not have a clue what a demountable unit is.  He had never heard of such a thing.  He thought it was something from outer space.  It had to be explained to him.  I hope he has learned what it is in the meantime because many people in rural Ireland lived in them very happily for a long time.  Thanks be to God they were not relying on the Taoiseach to provide them.  He would not have been able to do so because he did not know what they were.  I want to ensure that they will be provided in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300039#RR00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1528903200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on housing.  I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for bringing forward this motion.  We need immediate action to tackle this problem.  The majority of those becoming homeless are in the private rental sector.  I refer to huge numbers of my constituents from Bandon, Kilbrittain, Ballinspittle, Ballinadee, Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Leap and Goleen.  The list is endless.  People are unable to get on the property ladder and have to resort to paying huge rents.  It has nearly come to the point that renting is more expensive than paying a monthly mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  Why are we not doing more to encourage people to afford and own their own homes?  During the negotiations relating to A Programme for a Partnership Government, we discussed a rural resettlement scheme.  Depopulation is a worrying trend in rural communities.  They do not stand still - they either develop or decline.  As the housing crisis in our towns and cities worsens, there has never been a better time to promote rural resettlement.  This scheme has been rolled out in County Clare and elsewhere.  Can the scheme be applied to west Cork?  I refer to areas such as Ballineen, Drinagh, Drimoleague, Curragh, Ballydehob, Crookhaven and Durrus.  That is to name only a few of the areas affected by diminishing populations.  We have seen the closure of schools, post offices, Garda stations and local businesses and we need to take action to bring people into these areas.  Most of them have wonderful community playgrounds and community centres.  Let us promote what these areas have to offer, encourage people to live in them areas and ensure that they can afford to do so.<\/p>  <p>  There needs to be a plan put in place to source and build affordable housing in rural communities.  That would enable urban-based families to move to rural areas through a resettlement scheme.  The benefits of country living are endless.  Those living in small rural communities tend to have a strong sense of identity and a pride of place.  Children would be able to attend rural primary schools where everyone knows each other and class sizes are small.  That would also promote the importance of keeping schools open in rural areas such as those in west Cork.  Rural resettlement needs to be explored and promoted.  It is time that the Government listened and took real action.<\/p>  <p>  Young couples are also seeking planning permission.  I see that the length and breadth of my own constituency.  Everything - every fence and ditch - is put in people's way.  It prevents them from getting planning permission, forces them onto the social housing list and gives them no other choice.  We find out now that it is an absolute nightmare for people in my constituency to get money from the new Rebuilding Ireland loans scheme, which was supposed to cure all problems.  I was convinced or fooled and I advised people, through my constituency office, to make sure to go for these loans.  Hardworking young people are trying to make a start and they are finding out now that over 50% of them cannot get the money in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  We are conning people continuously.  It is either through planning permission or through false promises of council housing or social housing coming on stream.  They are being let down repeatedly by this Minister of State.  He has to stand up here for once and tell the truth.  The Government is not acting on behalf of the people, whether that is in a rural resettlement scheme or the planning permission to give people a home to start off their life in.  They are being continuously let down by this Government.  It has turned its back on them.  It cannot continue to do that.  I ask the Minister of State to stand by the people and do something for them.  He should not to go down the road of fooling them with new loan schemes that are not there.

There is little I can say today that I have not said before.  The Government's housing strategy is simply not working.  By any metric, it is failing badly.  House prices are skyrocketing, rents are still rising unsustainably and every month new records for homelessness and child homelessness are being set.<\/p>  <p>  The ideas outlined in the motion are not new.  Many Opposition Deputies have been calling for them for years.  We are calling for them again because the Government has not listened.  In June 2016, the Committee on Housing and Homelessness issued its final report.  It recommended that the State increase its social housing stock by an average of 10,000 units per year.  It identified the core root of the crisis as being the lack of building by local authorities and the Government's over-reliance on the private sector.  The Government still has not changed its approach.  It is still convinced the private sector will solve the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In June last year, the D&aacute;il passed a Green Party motion calling for an independent and well-resourced building regulator to protect homeowners.  The Government has instead continued with its self-certification regime.  In November, the D&aacute;il passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for greater protection and security for tenants.  The Government has not made any move to provide greater support for renters.  In March, the D&aacute;il passed another Green Party motion calling for the implementation of a cost-rental model of affordable public housing.  There is no sign of the Government embracing cost-rental housing on the scale needed to tackle this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has not changed its course.  We have heard constant talk of new politics since the beginning of this D&aacute;il.  We have seen it in action.  We have seen cross-party support for a change of approach when it comes to housing.  We, as the Opposition, have provided the ideas.   We have called on the Government to take action.  Is that not how a parliament is supposed to work?  Obviously not on the watch of this Minister of State when it comes to tackling this unprecedented crisis in housing and homelessness.  If a change is not made, we will continue to be in a housing crisis for as long as this Government lasts.  It is a symptom of incredible short-sightedness to think that the road this Government has been going down on housing can work.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has tried its way for too long and it is not working.  It is never too late to listen.  Start today and commit to taking on board the ideas the Opposition puts forward.  Let us commit to working together.  This is not a laughing matter.  We are talking about an unprecedented crisis in homelessness and housing.

I drew attention to the comments made by the United Nations special rapporteur on housing who is visiting Ireland this week.  Those comments amount to us being told again that Ireland is failing abysmally in dealing with what is now a housing emergency and it is an escalating emergency.  Ms Farha said that one of her primary reasons for becoming interested in Ireland was because of NAMA and the unprecedented nature of how it is operating despite the country being in the midst of a housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Almost 10,000 people are homeless according to the official homelessness figures.  We know many more are not being counted.  I refer to people we all come across who have been couch surfing for years.<\/p><p>Mr. Mel Reynolds, an architect who is very involved in the housing issue, told us recently that NAMA controls enough development land to build approximately 65,000 housing units.  Local authorities own zoned residential land with a total capacity of 48,724 housing units across the country.  Dublin City Council alone has land sufficient for 18,000 units, while the three outer Dublin councils have enough for 29,000 units, yet in the last four years we have seen a total of 818 social housing builds completed nationally.  In 2017 local authorities built 394 units, yet in the same year the State transferred over &euro;1 billion in housing supports to private landlords.  The balance of priorities is completely skewed.  Mr. Reynolds made that point in real terms when he explained that one year's supply of purpose built social housing is meeting less that two weeks of subsidised housing demand.<\/p> <p> The sums just do not make sense.  At this stage one in three tenancies are in receipt of some form of State rent assistance.  It is a cycle of failure and waste, perpetuated by the refusal to acknowledge the fact that relying on the private market to solve this crisis will never work.  The State must take responsibility for providing affordable housing that is accessible to all.  Ms Farha warned against the mindset that views housing as a commodity rather than the bedrock of a stable and healthy society.  Without a secure roof over a person's head it is very difficult for him or her to be a functioning member of society.  So many people are in that precarious state.<\/p> <p> A dysfunctional society is not in anyone's interest, whether one considers oneself left-wing, right-wing or anything in between.  Singapore, for example, despite its right-wing Government, has some of the highest levels of social housing globally, to the point that it is so much a part of the fabric of its society it sits seamlessly within the housing sector.<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats have previously tabled a motion seeking to change the NAMA Act in order to shift the priority of the agency.  There are currently seven different issues identified in the NAMA Act, including the restructuring of financial institutions, which are given precedence ahead of the need to address the compelling need to contribute to the social fabric and the development of the State.  I urge the Minister of State to consider whether or not he truly believes the balance of priorities within the NAMA Act are fit for purpose given the current crisis.  We clearly have sufficient land, so that should not be an impediment.  Whatever announcements have been made, the delivery of social housing units has been abysmal.  Without that, this crisis is going to continue.  We will keep trying to solve it in an expensive way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300039#RR01000","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528903800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>A report by the United Nations published one year ago said: &quot;Housing and urban real estate have become the commodity of choice for corporate finance, a safety deposit box for the wealthy, a repository of capital and excess liquidity.&quot;  That report showed that US $163 trillion is now invested in residential real estate worldwide, which is more than twice the size of the entire gross domestic product of the world.  Housing and property is big business and makes big profits, more than ever since the global crash of 2008.  It is particularly the case in Ireland.  The average yield on Irish property stood at 7.08% in August of 2017, up from 6.54% in 2016 and far, far ahead of the rest of the member states of the European Union.<\/p><p>We are now witnessing the rise of corporate landlordism in Ireland.  This is not an uncle or an aunt who has inherited a house, but rather big business entering the market and seeking big profits.  NAMA has facilitated it, as can be seen in the case of I-RES REIT.  Kennedy Wilson, a huge US corporate landlord, recently purchased the Elysian Towers in Cork.  The rise of corporate landlordism is shown in the example of the Leeside apartments in Cork, where a company, Lugus Capital, which is linked to Bain Capital, one of the biggest vulture funds in the world, snapped up apartments in Cork city centre and within days issued notices to quit to residents, who are low income families, many of which have kids and many of which have been resident there for years.  That approach is being resisted, but it is clear how the housing needs of the 99% are being subordinated to the capital accumulation of the 1%.<\/p><p>This can also be seen in the approach of Airbnb in this country.  Airbnb started life as a small-scale host community, where ordinary people engaged in accommodation sharing.  Internationally it is becoming a field for landlords and speculators to intervene to make profits on a major scale.  Airbnb was a &euro;15 billion industry by the end of 2016.  Ireland is no exception to this.  We do not have enough information on the issue because Airbnb does not engage in data sharing, but my sense of it is that Ireland is no exception to the European norm.  In every city and town in this country it can be seen that there are more short-term lets on Airbnb than on <i>daft.ie<\/i>for long-term lets.  I understand that an expert group is due to report to the Government on that issue soon.  Can the Minister of State tell us exactly when that group will report?  I look forward to the debate around that issue.<\/p><p>The State is being rolled back and housing is being privatised under this and previous Governments.  In the 1970s one in five houses in this State were social housing.  Today, that is less than one in ten.  The UN special rapporteur on adequate housing, Ms Leilani Farha has been quoted in this debate.  I will quote her again.  She said, in the course of her visit to Ireland:<\/p><blockquote>Evictions continue unabated worldwide, particularly because so many people lack security of tenure.  Unregulated private actors are filling the void left by Governments that are continuously receding from the housing sector, thereby leaving unchallenged the prevailing paradigm that housing is a commodity rather than a social good.  Ireland is in the throes of all of these phenomena.<\/blockquote><p>It could be added that Ireland is in the throes of all of these phenomena in significant measure thanks to the policies of its Government.  Ten thousand people are homeless in this State.  That is a fraction of the real figure when people who are couch surfing are taken into account; it could be double, treble or quadruple that number.  The Government and the Minister have doctored the figures, but it is clear that 10,000 are homeless.  At the same time payments are being made to private landlords which will cost the taxpayer &euro;23 billion more over 30 years than would be the case if social houses were built instead.  The profits for the investors are locked in, but the young generation are being locked out.  This is copperfastened by politics; a Fine Gael led Government, propped up by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Both parties are joined at the hip in their support for the market.  In Fine Gael some 37% of its parliamentarians are landlords.  Some 31% of Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentarians are landlords.<\/p><p>The national coalition on housing and homelessness organised a demonstration which was attended by 10,000 people this year, and it will go to the streets again in the Autumn.  Unity is required to fight the housing crisis, but it must be unity in support of public housing on public lands and unity against the market, which has failed the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300040#SS00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1528903800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>This housing crisis originated over a decade ago, springing from a particular ideology.<\/p><p>That ideology said that the State would build no more houses and it would be left up to the free market.  That is why we have a homelessness crisis and a housing crisis today in which nearly 10,000 people are homeless.  That can seem abstract to people in this House but it is not abstract to me or to most of my comrades here.  People are living in hotels and bed and breakfasts and sometimes in cars, tents and streets.  It is completely unacceptable.  <\/p> <p> I will mention the C-word, which is \"class\".  There is a deep class prejudice in the Government when it comes to housing.  The narrative is that social housing equates to ghettoisation, bad people and anti-social behaviour.  I reject that and, as a person who comes from a council estate, find it insulting.  There are some amazing people who have lived in council houses.  The majority of social housing has been a huge success in this country.  Of course there are instances where it has failed but it has largely been successful.  Under this Government and under Fianna F&aacute;il, social housing has become a dirty word.  That is why we have a terrible situation in this country. <\/p> <p> I want to make it less abstract and I want the Minister of State to comment on this point, which really gets at the heart of the problem.  There is a site in Clondalkin called Kilcarbery Grange.  It is a site of 71 acres and it is being sold off to private developers.  This land could provide as many as 900 social and affordable homes.  It is owned by the State, which is selling it off to developers.  The council will then buy back 30% of the houses from the developers.  Basically, the council will sell the land, the developer will build the houses and then the developer will sell that 30% back to the council.  How does that make sense?  The council will have to buy 30%, approximately 290 houses, at market rate.  Can anybody make sense of this?  I do not know how this makes sense.  What the Government is doing, as have successive Governments, is to sell public land off to developers at the height of the worst crisis in the State.  That is absolutely unforgivable.  It comes down to political choice and political ideology.  <\/p> <p> Some people do not like using the word \"class\".  I actually like using it.  It defines the situation we have in this country, where people are discriminated against on a class basis.  If these were 10,000 people from a different class bracket, this would not be the case.  The Minister of State knows that, as do I and as does everyone in this House.  If this affected 10,000 people from Foxrock, there would not be 10,000 people on the streets or homeless.  That is a fact.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300040#SS00300","speaker":"1299","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I will try to get the details on some of the points that have been raised directly by Deputies.

I arrived at the debate just before the contributions from Members of the Rural Independent Group.  They were speaking about demountable houses and rural cottages.

I completely agree with them that local authorities building houses or providing demountables on land owned by citizens was a scheme that worked very well and local authorities still provide it.  It is still within the gift of local authorities to provide such schemes, and the Members outlined that the scheme still exists in Kerry.  I presume they were talking about increasing the funding from the State.  However, it is still within the ambit of members of Kerry Country Council to allocate more funding for such measures if they believe that more demountables or rural cottages should be built.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge Deputy Catherine Murphy's remarks on Singapore.  I happened to be there recently for the St. Patrick's Day events several months ago.  I visited the urban planning initiative in the city of Singapore, and it was eye-opening.  However, the version of election to government that exists in Singapore is different to what we have in this country.  While it is fair to say that private ownership and the free market are significant drivers of the Singaporean economy, a lot of land is publicly owned.  In fact, the state owns virtually everything.  The military owns about 20% of the landmass of Singapore.  While the comparison is interesting on many levels, this is quite different to our method of land ownership in this country.  I do not deny the fact that local authorities, agencies and arms of the State own significant amounts of land in this country.<\/p>  <p>  On tenants, it is interesting to note that there is a conflict.  The Rural Independent Group Members have left but they spoke about tenant purchasing, which is diametrically opposed to the left-wing view of housing stock whereby houses that are built by the State should be kept in the housing pool, whether it is run by local authorities or centrally by Government.

However, I will try to answer the Deputy more fully at a later time.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gino Kenny' comments on ideology were interesting and in some respects, I do not disagree with him.  He said that more ten years ago, there was a change.  Indeed there was and the change meant that when the collapse in the economy came and the construction sector collapsed, we were so reliant on Part V provision for many of our local authority houses and so many construction workers left that not only did private house building collapse but we did not have the physical capacity or manpower for public houses either.  I could not swear to it, but I believe that ideological change came in one of the Planning and Development Acts that were enacted the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Noel Dempsey was Minister.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of my own home city of Kilkenny and Waterford, the city beside which I live, I absolutely agree.  I grew up on a 60-acre farm in south Kilkenny with two bedrooms.  Eight people lived in the house.  It was my aunt's house.  I can assure Deputy Gino Kenny that from a class point of view, there is not as much between he and I as others might think.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300041#TT01000","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I repeat, 60 acres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300041#TT01100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Yes, but we did not grow up in a palace.  I acknowledge the role of social housing and even significantly large chunks of social housing.  There is a whole side of Kilkenny city, the western environs, which is virtually all composed of it.  One can see by the house design in what era the houses were built.  They were largely privately bought out by their tenants and some are now among the most costly houses that can be bought in Kilkenny.  I refer to the old cut-stone social hoses that were built in the 1920s or 1930s near the Garda station.<\/p>  <p>  I think there was a comprehensive decision, and it has been agreed pretty unanimously in respect of some of the larger-scale social housing developments on the south side of Limerick city.<\/p><p>Perhaps it is also the case in parts of Clondalkin.  I do not know Clondalkin that well.  In parts of north-west Dublin city, where the tower blocks were removed and other social housing units  provided, the necessary social infrastructure was not put in.  It was not so much that the housing itself was a problem but that communities were transferred out of the city into the suburbs and left to their own devices.  That happened in different waves in the 1960s and 1970s and into the 1980s.  There was a change whereby social housing should be more integrated into every other form of housing.  At the time these issues were discussed, I was a Member of the Seanad and there was not much political opposition.<\/p> <p> I refer specifically to some of the points made, progress is being made in the housing market.  I know that at times perhaps it is imperceptible or not fast enough for people, but the indicators in most, if not all, areas are positive for the first time in several years.  For example, there were 20,800 planning permissions in 2017, which was an increase of 27% on 2016.  In the year to April, there were 23% more commencement notices and a 35% increase in housing scheme registrations.  At the end of April, An Bord Plean&aacute;la had approved 19 planning applications under the new fast-track arrangements for almost 3,000 homes and 3,600 student bed spaces.<\/p> <p> With regard to social housing, the Government has ring-fenced a capital programme of more than &euro;6 billion.  A significant expansion of the social housing build programme was evident in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The construction status report indicated there were 850 schemes or phases at the end of 2017 delivering 13,400 homes, a substantial increase on the 8,400 homes in the programme a year earlier.  All of this was facilitated by an investment of &euro;1.6 billion of taxpayers' money, including an additional &euro;100 million provided in December 2017.  This year, the Government will allocate more than &euro;1.8 billion to housing programmes, an increase of more than &euro;500 million in 2017.  To better co-ordinate the response to homelessness, the homelessness interagency group was established in September, and the Minister recently received a report from the group, which he will bring to the Government shortly.  Earlier this week, he also received a report from the DRHE.  The content of both reports will be reviewed carefully and I expect him to introduce a number of policy responses to address the issues raised.<\/p> <p> As the economy continues to progress towards delivering the levels of housing supply needed, the Government is committed to ensuring new homes are accessible and affordable.  The affordable purchase schemes were stood down in 2011, but it must be borne in mind that market conditions at the time resulted in house prices falling by more than 50% in some places and there was consequential significant easing of affordability during that particular period.  However, the Government recognises we still face challenges with regard to affordability and the rental sector.  Some of the recent target measures are helping in this area.  We have measures such as the fast-track of planning reforms, and I referred to recent permissions approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is a &euro;200 million investment in enabling infrastructure to service or open up housing land, with proportionate affordability dividends for house purchases, and the progression of large-scale mixed tenure housing projects with social, affordable and private housing on publicly owned lands.  First quarter figures indicate the introduction of the RPZs is beginning to have a moderate positive effect on rent inflation.  It is certain that rent would be higher without the RPZs and other controls.<\/p> <p> We are supporting first-time buyers to buy a new or second hand home through the new Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, and 220 applications had been recommended for approval by the end of April.  As the year progresses, we expect this to increase significantly.  I will endeavour to get a more complete response for Deputy Gino Kenny on the issue he raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300041#TT01200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528905000,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Before the Minister of State picked up his script and started reading the usual \"blah, blah, blah\" we get from the Department - with all due respect to the Minister of State, not the Department - I found his contribution interesting.  At least there was engagement with the facts, ideology and ambitions related to housing and what they all mean.  He made an interesting comment in response to Deputy Gino Kenny about the left-wing view of housing.  The much quoted Ms Leilani Farha is not a left winger.  She is a rapporteur for the United Nations and her views on housing are quite similar to ours on the left in the House.  They are that housing is a human right.  In her submission yesterday in Dublin she called on governments to ensure that the markets served housing need rather than investment priorities, and she reminded states that they are first and foremost accountable to human rights.<\/p>  <p>  I came across an example of those human rights two days ago.  I got a phone call from a woman who headed up a Ballyfermot helping the homeless group.  She asked me whether I could do anything as she was outside Tallaght Garda station where a grandmother, parents and four children were locked up because they sat in in South Dublin County Council offices in Tallaght.  They had nowhere to go.  They were made homeless on 7 June and put out of private rental accommodation.  They had been in three counties in as many nights, shifted from Ashbourne, County Meath to Gardiner Street, Dublin 1 to Rathdrum, County Wicklow.  They had been ringing all morning to try to get hotel accommodation and could not get any so they went to the offices of South Dublin County Council in Tallaght and refused to move.  They ended up in Tallaght Garda station.  A file on the mother has been sent to the DPP, with the possibility of her being charged.  She will be charged with defending the human rights of her four children.<\/p>  <p>  I rang the head of the DRHE who was very helpful.  She immediately got onto the family and got them sorted in accommodation on the South Circular Road.  What she said that was most interesting was that these are the most difficult people to deal with in homelessness because they are big families.  I was in a family of seven and we were considered small on my estate as most families had 12 members.  This is a big family nowadays, with four children, and hotels will not take them because they need two bedrooms to be accommodated.  I do not know where the family has ended up, but the mother may be charged as a consequence of defending the human rights of her children.  Does the Minister of State not feel shame about this fact in this day and age?  Does he not feel shame and horror that we live in a world that can spend more than half its GDP on investment in land and property that is just used for speculation and investment and causes much worse human misery than I have highlighted throughout the globe and increasingly here in Ireland?<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the comments of the head of the DRHE because we are both agreed on this.  I will say to anybody who is being thrown out of private rented accommodation because the HAP is not working and because landlords want to sell up and they have nowhere to go having tried to access HAP to stay put and occupy the premises they are in and not to go into homelessness if they have a family because it is nothing but pure misery and they owe it to their children to stay put.  Ms Eileen Gleeson agreed with me because she is at the end of her tether.  There is no movement or ability for her to deal with the increasing problem of family homelessness.  Many of them are working families.  This should make us feel horrified.<\/p>  <p>  There are ten acres of prime land in the middle of Inchicore on St Michael's Estate just down the road from where that family is from.  The community in Inchicore has worked hard for the past 17 years to try to get it developed for public housing on public land.  The people have met all the agencies, all the local Deputies here today and political parties and they are campaigning strongly.  I am not sure if the Minister has met them but if he has, he has made a commitment to do so.  They have presented him with a model to provide public housing on public land, a major part of which is a return to the public purse because, under the scheme, the State would be able to rent back to couples who are working but cannot afford to live in the lucrative private rental sector.  A total of 60% of the planet's GDP is being used for speculation and profit and not for human needs and human rights.  The ideology of Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il will not suit making that change.<\/p><p>A left-wing ideology is needed in order to facilitate that ultimate change.  That is why this is an ongoing battle in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300042#UU00200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528905600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank everybody who contributed to the debate, particularly those who are supporting the motion.  Earlier, I should have thanked Mr. Mel Reynolds and Ms Orla Hegarty for the briefing they gave us.  Many of the facts and some of the ideas in the motion came from them and the Government should start listening to them.<\/p><p>To be honest, apart from the brief attempt to engage with the matters by the final Government speaker, we just had the Minister reeling off the usual list of achievements and he did not really engage with the central thrust of the motion.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien and I agree that, as noted <i>ad nauseam<\/i>in this motion and more generally, public land should be used for public and affordable housing.  The other specifics in the motion do not in any sense cut against that.  We are saying there is a reason we are not getting public and affordable housing on public land or from the private sector.  Coincidentally, Ms Leilani Farha came to Ireland this week and her words reflected exactly what is in this motion.  That was not orchestrated.  Along with the human misery being suffered by those affected by the housing and homelessness crisis, there is another group of people making money out of it.  The worse the crisis gets, the more money they make from it.<\/p><p>Look at the largest house builder in the State, namely, Cairn Homes.  It plans to build 12,000 units but how many social units were built in 2016?  A total of 103.  Last year, Cairn Homes built 200 units and next year it will build 800.  That is pathetic because it owns one of the biggest landbanks in Dublin.  The owners of the company sold 2.1% of their shares in 2017 between the three of them for &euro;26 million.  The three founders also split &euro;61 million in shares last year and they raked in &euro;4.1 million in wages and bonuses between them.  This is the biggest developer in the country and it is drip feeding small amounts of housing into the market to boost share prices and make an absolute killing, and we are allowing it to do so.  NAMA has flogged &euro;40 billion of property because of the mandate this Government gave to entities such as Cairn and vulture funds like I-RES REIT.<\/p><p>We can go through the list of these institutional investors.  Hines is going to build the biggest new development in Cherrywood but it has not built a single unit yet.  Some &euro;15 million from LIHAF has gone in but there is no guarantee of any affordable housing from that scheme.  Even the social housing being sold back is costing local authorities &euro;250,000 and &euro;450,000 when the site was bought from NAMA for a song.  Does Hines state that it builds houses?  No.  Its website refers to &quot;intelligent real estate investments&quot; and states &quot;We build smart investments&quot;.  It is what the company does.  It drip feeds housing or does not build it at all and the measures being taken by the Government have increased the value of its property and land, encouraging speculation.<\/p><p>There has been no answer to the following question, which I have asked several times of the Government.  Why did the original 40% affordable housing condition on LIHAF funding get dropped within weeks?  If it had been implemented, it would have cut against the profiteering of the private developers.  How could they sell property at an inflated price if the State had affordable housing at genuinely affordable rates?  This is why the public landbank is not being developed.<\/p><p>Why has the Government not provided a definition of &quot;affordable housing&quot;?  How can any of the public sites be developed if the Government refuses to define &quot;affordable&quot; while insisting that the housing must be public and affordable?  None of the sites at Shanganagh, Oscar Traynor Road or Inchicore can move forward while the Government does not provide a definition.  If it did provide one, the profits of these profiteers would be hit.  That is the problem - the Government is dancing to the tune of profiteers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300043#VV00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528905600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528905600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 14 June 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300043#VV00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009: Motions","time":1528905600,"counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300043#VV00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1528905600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>The two motions will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300043#VV00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1528905600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on the 30 June 2018 and ending on 29 June 2019.<\/blockquote><p>I wish to share time with Deputy Brophy.<\/p><p>The House will recall that the 1998 Act was a necessary and wholly proportionate response to the barbaric murder by the Real IRA of 29 innocent people at Omagh in August 1998, almost 20 years ago.  These robust provisions of the criminal law play an important role in enabling the Garda authorities and the courts to face down the threat from such terrorism.  In accordance with the Act, I have laid before the House a report on the operation of the relevant provisions over the past 12 months.  I will not take up the limited time by going through in detail each of the sections but I signal to the House that one element of section 9, that is to say, subsection (1)(b), is the subject of ongoing litigation.  It was declared invalid by the High Court in February but that declaration is being appealed.  The remainder of section 9 is not in question.  The report sets out in more detail than in previous years an assessment of the security position and while I do not intend to rehearse that, I will highlight some aspects.<\/p><p>There remains a real and persistent threat from republican paramilitary groups on this island, the so called dissidents.  These groups vehemently oppose peace and democracy and have spent 20 years trying to destroy the Good Friday Agreement and all it stands for.  I am determined that these terrorists will not succeed and the bullet or bomb will not prevail over the ballot box.  I refer also to the threat posed by jihadist-type terrorism.<\/p><p>The raw brutality of the attacks targeting innocent people that we have seen, including on our nearest European neighbours, is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of all open democracies to this threat.<\/p> <p> I pay particular tribute to the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who continue to work tirelessly to preserve life and to counter all threats from terrorism.  I pay tribute also to the men and women of the police and security services in Northern Ireland, with whom the Garda work closely every single day to enhance the safety of all communities on this island.<\/p> <p> The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 was a response to difficulties facing the justice system from certain organised criminal gangs behaving as though they were beyond the law.  Section 8 provides that four particularly serious organised crime offences should be tried in the Special Criminal Court, subject to the DPP not directing otherwise.  Again, I will not delay the House by repeating the detail of what is set out in the report I have laid before the House in accordance with section 8.  That report notes that no cases came for trial before the Special Criminal Court under section 8.<\/p> <p> No one can be under any illusion about the threat that society and the criminal justice system face from organised criminal gangs that will stop at nothing in pursuit of their criminal activities.  The Garda authorities are working intensively to bear down on these criminal gangs and to disrupt their activities.  The Garda deserves praise for the considerable success it has achieved against these gangs, and with the Government's support that work will continue.<\/p> <p> As set out in the two reports I have laid before the House, it is the clear view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the provisions in the 1998 and 2009 Acts continue to be most important in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism and serious organised crime.  On this basis, on the basis of the information set out in the report and on the advice of the Garda authorities at senior level, I propose that the House should approve the continued operation of the relevant provisions of the 1998 and 2009 Acts for a further 12 months commencing 30 June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300043#VV00700","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528906200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I echo what the Minister has said in calling for support for the 1998 and 2009 Acts.

If a party sets itself up as a modern political party and as expert in so many ways on our Judiciary, our policing and our Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it must understand that dealing with the threats we face from organised criminals, paramilitaries and international terrorism is essential to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the security of the State.

This is the third time I have spoken on these motions since my election to the House and appointment as justice spokesperson.  On each of the two previous occasions, I and Fianna F&aacute;il have supported the motions.  Without any question, we will support them again today.  We support them because, regrettably, we believe they are necessary.  We also believe they are a proportionate response to very serious criminal issues that this country faces.  We need to address those criminal issues rather than hide from them.<\/p><p>I have had the opportunity to read the reports the Minister has placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I found them helpful and informative.  The first motion relates to the extension of the 12 sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  Throughout the paper laid before the House, reference is made to the current security situation.  It should be pointed out that the greatest domestic threat to our security in this country at present is, as the Minister stated, the threat that comes from republican paramilitary groups, so-called dissident groups.  Sometimes people forget that there was a period in this island's past when we were plagued by violence.  That was prior to the Good Friday Agreement.  One of the great political achievements of the 20th century in Europe was the Good Friday Agreement.  Many of us, when we were growing up, thought that the violence in Northern Ireland was intractable, that it was not capable of resolution.  Fortunately, we have now set the pace for the world in showing that conflicts can be resolved and that no issue is too intractable to be protected from political resolution.  Every political problem can be resolved.  However, it is important to point out that there remains a domestic threat on this island from dissident groups.  Because of this, the legislation we are discussing under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is, unfortunately, necessary.<\/p><p>It is also important to point out that the reports refer to the international threat.  If one were to ask anyone outside of Ireland what the biggest threat is in respect of international terrorism, he or she would say it is religious extremism.  We need to recognise that the report placed before the Oireachtas this evening is not alarming.  All it says is that there are a small number of people here whose activities in support of extremism give cause for concern and that the authorities monitor their activities very closely.  If we were solely dealing with the international threat, perhaps there would be a strong argument against renewing the legislation.  However, in the context of the domestic threat, there can be no such uncertainty.<\/p><p>I wish to emphasise something else that is stated in the report.  Sometimes there is a concentration on associating religious extremism with the Islamic communities.  It is important to note that the following is emphasised in the report that has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas:<\/p><blockquote>the extremism underlying this threat is not characteristic of Ireland&rsquo;s peace-loving Muslim community.  Terrorism is not the product of one faith or belief system.  The only people responsible for terrorist attacks are the evil people who carry them out.<\/blockquote><p>I endorse these comments.<\/p><p>We know from the report in respect of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act that 23 convictions were secured in the courts in the period we are talking about and that a further 84 persons are awaiting trial.  These are not academic pieces of statutory provision that are not used in our criminal justice system.  They are used, and people are convicted as a result of the existence of this legislation.<\/p><p>It is also important to point out - not, though, that it is in any way determinative - the views of the Garda authorities.  We note that the Garda Commissioner has made clear to the Minister his view that the key provisions of the Offences Against the State Act are regularly used and that the Garda Commissioner considers it essential that the relevant provisions of the Act be extended for a further period of 12 months.  Therefore, having read the report, I think any objective assessment of it would lead a person to believe it is necessary for the 12 sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 to be renewed, and I and Fianna F&aacute;il will support their renewal.<\/p><p>The other motion before the House relates to the operation of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  Again, we have a relatively detailed report from the Minister on this matter.  One would want to be living in a parallel universe or on a different planet not to be aware that significant gangland issues face not just this city, but indeed the whole country.  Unfortunately, the value of human life in this country has been reduced considerably by the extent to which people are prepared to kill other people as part of criminal feuds.  Sometimes we seem to refer to this as being a feud involving two distinct groups.  Unfortunately, I have no doubt but that these assassinations, as they should be called, will spread.  Unfortunately, human life has become very cheap.  If one looks at any case before the Special Criminal Court at present dealing with gangland feuds, one will note that there is a potential threat that people who are up on charges or subsequently convicted of charges will interfere with juries.  We have seen in the past that witnesses have been intimidated in cases, that organised criminals have murdered journalists in this country and that lawyers are threatened in respect of cases they bring.<\/p><p>One cannot hide from the fact that, regrettably, the Special Criminal Court is necessary in this country.  If we did not have a Special Criminal Court, there would be miscarriages of justice.  Too often miscarriage of justice is taken to mean only those who are wrongfully convicted of criminal offences.  However, it also applies when someone who is guilty of a criminal offence is wrongfully acquitted.  We need to ensure that does not happen.<\/p> <p> I was pleased that Deputy Brophy was present for the debate.  I wondered whether it was a sign of his elevation to ministerial office.

Violent, serious organised crime, has become increasingly prominent, and continues to claim many lives, with many more under threat.  Since the killing of David Byrne at the Regency Hotel, garda&iacute; believe that they have foiled 52 threats to life related to gang activity.  However, there has also been considerable loss of life.  Between 2016 and 2017, 22 people died in gang-related killings.<\/p>  <p>  Against that background, and the violence, intimidation, drug running and other forms of criminality that go along with such gangsterism, there has been a devastating impact on communities, creating a climate of fear and concern.  This is not a situation we can ignore, or lightly dismiss.  We owe it to the communities who face this on a daily basis to tackle this head on, to take on these criminals, shut them down and put them behind bars.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise this will not be easy.  Tackling crime, particularly serious and organised crime, requires a resourced response, a legislative response, and a policing response.  The front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are doing all within their power to confront this problem.  However, contrary to its soundbites, the Government is not putting in place the resources required to face it down.  The figures tell us that Dublin has lost almost 100 garda&iacute; since last year, despite what the Minister and the Government are telling us about increased resources and numbers.  Dublin has lost approximately 900 garda&iacute; since 2010.  Last January, Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy stated, \"Despite the fact that there are new personnel, drainage into specialist units and transfers continue to reduce frontline policing ... We've hit rock bottom.\"  Last December ,there was an embargo on overtime for garda&iacute; in Dublin, including the special detective unit.  There has been a 40% reduction in community policing, with a greater reduction in some districts.  The lack of front-line personnel has hit the ability of the Garda to be aware what is going on in communities, and it is crippling the force as a result.<\/p>  <p>  The people who live with such hostility on a day-to-day basis often go forgotten because of the lottery of birth, and working class communities are disproportionately impacted as a result.  Were this happening in some of the more affluent suburbs of our cities perhaps the response would be different, and more cohesive.  Investment is needed in these communities.  Crime can thrive where the State neglects communities, and it cannot be tackled by policing alone.  We need targeted and substantial investment in community development, education and employment, particularly in areas where organised crime gangs are recruiting members and where their malign influence is having a devastating effect on social cohesion.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien, called for \"a comprehensive review of the emergency legislation in advance of its renewal next year\", which would focus on how to modernise the criminal justice system to make it responsive to the needs of Ireland in 2017.  I regret that this has not happened.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes new legislation is required to replace the outdated emergency Acts in place and to create a new legislative and procedural basis to deal with these particular cases.  We recognise certain criminal cases are more difficult to prosecute given the nature of organised crime.  The opportunity for well organised and well funded criminal enterprises to interfere with trials is greater than in the vast majority of criminal cases, and we are not ignorant of that.  The manner in which serious crime cases are tried is not adequate, and we need to offer greater protections to jurors and witnesses to ensure greater success in putting these criminals away.   We have always recognised that there may be - and in certain areas there must be - a requirement for specialisation of courts.  We have supported the establishment of specialised family and commercial courts.  We would consider favourably proposals regarding specialised courts, procedures and legislation for organised and serious crime, where it is shown to be needed.<\/p>  <p>  The legislative change required has been debated, and aspects of this change have been considered by bodies such as the Law Reform Commission.  There is a need to create a specific offence for jury tampering, as there is no such offence currently on the Statute Book.  There is also a need to increase penalties for intimidation of jurors under section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  There are undoubtedly circumstances where it will be appropriate, necessary, and proportionate to provide for anonymisation of juries and witnesses.  The Government, rightly, provided for the anonymisation of witnesses recently under the progressive Domestic Violence Act.  I commend the Government on that but a similar provision can surely be made in this regard.  This could be provided for via screens in court rooms or, in particular circumstances, through remote location of jurors with video links to courtrooms.  It is difficult to understand if the Government is serious about ensuring proper protections, why this matter has never been given proper consideration.  In such circumstances, there would also be a need for restrictions on access to jury lists and the abolition of daily roll call of jurors.  We would also support this in those instances.  We should take all steps necessary to ensure the safety of jurors and witnesses, but the Government has not even considered these matters.  Such legislation could have an inbuilt independent review of the legislation to ensure its effectiveness and that it is rights-proofed. <\/p>  <p>  We also need, outside of the legislative framework, to get more serious about tackling serious and organised crime in this State.  I urge the Minister to ensure the full implementation of Garda Inspectorate report recommendations on serious crime.<\/p><p>There is also a need for an annual national threat assessment.  This is a feature in numerous states, for example in Norway, the United States and Britain, that allows for evaluation of threats of international and domestic forms and which has application in evaluating security and serious and organised crime threats.  The Irish approach of reports and threat assessments by the national security committee is <i>ad hoc<\/i>and unstructured.  This should be put on a more periodic basis.<br\/><br\/>These current motions relate to the Special Criminal Court and specifically to provisions under the 1998 and 2009 Acts relating to the same.  The Special Criminal Court was first established under the Offences against the State Act 1939 during the Second World War to counter what the Government viewed as a threat to the State&rsquo;s neutrality from the IRA.  Its current incarnation dates from May 1972.  The reality is that the Offences against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court are ineffective relics of a conflict era which have failed to deal with the new threats posed by organised crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300045#XX00800","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528907400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>The lads have not gone away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300046#YY00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1528907400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>It operates with a standard operating procedure of non-jury trials.

This means ending the state of emergency under which the Offences against the State Act operates.  It is not sensible to perpetuate a situation in which we are relying on an annual renewal of outdated emergency legislation.  We are using 20th century tools for what is now a very different challenge in the 21st century.  Consequently, we need new legislation and new tools.  Last year Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien called for an a comprehensive review of the legislation that governs such trials and all related matters.  It is unfortunate that suggestion was not taken up.  I once again call on the Minister to take on this work.  We will engage enthusiastically with him and play our role to ensure that organised crime is given no quarter and that we have an effective policing, legislative and policy response to shut down this threat.  I hope that in 12 months' time we are in a position to consider the outcome of that rather than another renewal of archaic legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300046#YY00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1528907400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>It is a case of crocodile tears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300046#YY00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1528907400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Deputy Brophy will still go into government with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300046#YY00500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1528907400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thought that Deputy Brophy's remarks were revealing when he said that to be \"fit for government\" one has to prove oneself by voting for repressive legislation and voting against civil liberties.  That is unfortunately appropriate in a state founded in a counter-revolution and in bloody repression of which the political forefathers of Deputy Brophy and party of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, were in charge.  We have an uncomfortable 100 year anniversary coming up, that of the massacre of prisoners without trial.  That is unfortunately the real history of this State and it shows the need for a revolutionary break with that approach under which civil liberties and democratic rights have been sacrificed again and again in the interests of the establishment.<\/p>  <p>  To be clear, we are absolutely opposed to the renewal of the continuing operation of these sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  Every year for 20 years this House has renewed the operations of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act.  It is an annual event which, as Deputy O'Callaghan rightly said, often features effectively the same speeches being given.  I have spoken on this motion before, as have Deputies Coppinger and Barry on previous occasions.  Former Deputy Joe Higgins was a Member of this House when the Act was rushed through in 1998, one day after the abhorrent Omagh bomb atrocity.  That was a horrific act which resulted in more deaths than any other bombing in the course of the Troubles.  The establishment at the time used the disgusting attack on the people of Omagh to bring in harsh legislation which has remained on the Statute Book ever since.  Joe Higgins was correct to oppose these measures when they were proposed in 1998.  The Minister at the time even described it as draconian legislation.<\/p>  <p>  We, and people out there, should remember that this law applies to everybody in the State, not just the tiny minority which may threaten to engage or may actually engage in acts of terrorism.  The 1998 Act allows the rules of evidence to be changed and for an increase in the length of time for which a person can be detained.  The State wants to keep these powers on the books and, even though the provisions are not used regularly, there is a reason it wants to retain those powers rather than to let them lapse.  The 2009 Act allows for non-jury trials for certain offences related to organised crime.  Let there be no doubt about it, organised crime is a blight on communities.  It is particularly working-class communities and deprived communities that bear the brunt of organised crime, particularly in the area of drugs.<\/p>  <p>  We support the right to trial by jury.  We take that right seriously.  We do not think that one can be half a civil libertarian or that one can support the right to trial by jury in some circumstances but not in others.  The right to a jury trial is an essential question of civil liberties.  Measures are needed to protect juries from intimidation, such as partly exist for witnesses, rather than throwing out jury trials altogether.  The Special Criminal Court should be abolished in that respect.  There is another particularly questionable aspect to the 2009 Act.  Even if one concedes the idea of non-jury trials, the idea that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be empowered to decide how the courts will try these offences, which is the idea that the prosecution should have the power to decide whether to have a judge trial or a jury trial, is clearly repugnant to any basic idea of civil liberties.<\/p>  <p>  It is unfortunately the case that when dealing with terrorism or organised criminal gangs the State primarily rests upon and puts forward the idea of repression and suppression of civil liberties.  Any quick glance at history will show that throughout the years of the Troubles in the North no amount of repressive measures by the British, Northern or Southern states resulted in the ending of the conflict.  Thousands were arrested and interned.  Even when there were trials, they would not be what we would consider to be fair trials or to have resulted in reliable convictions.  We obviously know of a number of very high profile cases of that nature.<\/p>  <p>  The most effective way to overcome terrorism - we should be clear that socialists are absolutely opposed to the methods of individual terrorism - is to build a mass movement built on workers and young people on a cross-community basis.  Terrorist methods inflame sectarian divisions and are absolutely counterproductive.  The best opposition to that is mass opposition to a return to conflict.  This provides a protection against terrorism.  It is socialists and trade unionists who have continually held back sectarian conflict throughout the Troubles by bringing pressure to bear on paramilitaries on both sides while State forces have inflamed the conflict with repression.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly with organised crime the main offer of the State is repression, which has not worked.  Much of the organised crime is involved in the illegal drugs trade.  As well as cracking down on those criminal gangs we need to see a complete change in how the drug problem is dealt with.  The trade has to be taken out of the hands of these gangs that make massive profit preying off those who are vulnerable and those with addictions.  Recreational drugs should be decriminalised, but that should be combined with significant investment in our communities, addiction services and so on.  We will be voting against these renewals today because we are opposed to the continuation of attacks on civil liberties by the State and stand full square for people's democratic rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300046#YY00600","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1528907400,"counter":475,"content":"<p>We now move to Independents 4 Change.

We know the reason for the original Special Criminal Court, which came out of the 1939 Act, was to protect Ireland's neutrality during the Second World War and we know of the circumstances of the Troubles in the 1970s.  There is a longevity, however, to the Special Criminal Court.  It now seems to be enshrined in our legal system and almost normalised as a court setting.  That is not acceptable in a modern, democratic, functioning state with a small population such as Ireland has.  We know of the overwhelming support for the Good Friday Agreement and we know of the peace that has prevailed in spite in some paramilitary activity.  Violence is always regrettable but that paramilitary activity is not centre stage and is not threatening the State so those special circumstances do not prevail.<\/p><p>As the Minister has outlined, the main reason relates to a serious terrorist threat to the State and continuing violence on the part of dissident groups.  However, this threat has been minimal.  An increasing number of the dissident groups have announced they are turning away from the armed struggle.  That should be reflected in this discussion.<\/p> <p> As an aside, I wish to comment on that very undemocratic, unjust system that prevails in the North, namely, the parole commission system whereby there is closed evidence and a lack of access for people to appropriate representation.  There are frequent delays and postponements, hence lengthy remands and people being kept in detention, sometimes for over two years, without a charge or conviction and then being released back into society.  We just seem to accept this happening just 50 or 60 miles up the road.<\/p> <p> Why do we continue with the Special Criminal Court?  We know the views of organisations such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  The UN Commission on Human Rights has frequently called for the court's suspension.  There is an irony in this because we know Ireland has a very considerable reputation when it comes to human rights, yet this is a human right that we are very conveniently ignoring.  The criticisms are the lack of a jury and the increasing use of the court to try cases relating to so-called ordinary crime.  The Minister mentioned serious gangland crime being used as a reason.  I represent the constituency that has been most affected by the recent gangland feud.  I acknowledge that there is some support for a special criminal court because of intimidation.  However, that intimidation is of the witnesses.  There are ways to deal with jury intimidation other than through the Special Criminal Court.  We see this in countries that have much more serious gangland crime than that which obtains here.  In 2009, the Minister criticised the use of a special criminal court in respect of gangland crime.  The best way to cope with gangland crime is to hit the perpetrators where it hurts them the most, that is, their pockets.  We saw the recent success of Garda intelligence-gathering in the prevention of murders and attacks, in addition to the seizing of money and goods.  This is a much better way of tackling gangland crime.<\/p> <p> We seem to believe judges are above reproach, beyond fault and perfect in all of the judgments but there are plenty of examples to the contrary.  Why is there a discrepancy in their sentencing?  We have to work towards eliminating the Special Criminal Court because, regardless of the crime, there is a basic right to justice, which means being tried by a jury of one's peers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300046#YY00800","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528908000,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I have described this previously as a pantomime.  It is a pantomime.  That it is does a shocking disservice to the seriousness of the issues involved.  We are being asked to renew absolutely extraordinary powers and provisions that apply to suspected organised crime and alleged terrorist offences.  We are being asked to allow a special criminal court that admits hearsay evidence on the basis of very low thresholds of Garda evidence to continue in existence.  We are being asked to agree to the continued exercise of emergency powers by the State and its agencies.  I refer to powers that are supposed to apply only if the ordinary courts are not adequate in order to secure effective administration and the preservation of peace and order.  We are being asked to do that without a single detail to support the request.<\/p>  <p>  We have been treated to a six-page report without any of the threats being documented, be they domestic, terrorist, national or international.  We are treated only to a summary of vague threats from dissident republicans and some absolute boilerplate stuff about international terrorism.  That is all we get.  Here we are, it seems, in a permanent state of emergency whereby detail does not seem to matter and human rights can be suspended on nothing more than a Government whim.  This is despite the fact that I do not believe any reasonable person could today claim that there is a public emergency threatening the survival of the nation.  Would the Government ever get over itself?<\/p>  <p>  It should be pointed out that the evidence thresholds in the Special Criminal Court are lower than in the ordinary courts.  The fact that the word of a senior garda could deprive somebody of his liberty for years or decades is absolutely frightening.

If the Government stopped allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a base from which to create untold destruction in the Middle East and North Africa, the threat of international terrorism to which the Minister refers would be far less significant.  Why has the Government not considered this if it is serious about it and really worried about it?<\/p><p>That the Special Criminal Court is now being used to deal with the escalation in gangland crimes and murders is a load of nonsense.

The Government is feeding the gangs with its draconian legislation on drugs and doing no one in this country who suffers at their hands any favours.<\/p><p>Human rights groups have been very critical of the expansion of the Special Criminal Court to hear cases relating to organised crime.  There is no way on God's earth that we will agree to these motions.  The human rights groups also criticised the fact that the court is being routinely used to charge people with the crime of membership of an organisation.  This function of the court is particularly offensive as it is riding roughshod over international human rights law.  Professor Dermot Walsh eloquently argued the following in the Hederman report in respect of the provisions in the Offences Against the State Act when he stated:<\/p><blockquote>There is no requirement for the individual to have gone through a prior act of initiation into the organisation, nor is there any requirement for the individual to proclaim himself or herself a member or for the organisation to claim him or her as a member, nor is there any requirement for the individual to be in possession of property belonging to the organisation or to participate in the activities of the organisation.  It is sufficient for an individual simply <i>to be<\/i>a member of the organisation, and that <i>state of being<\/i>can be established on the basis of the &quot;opinion&quot; evidence of a Chief Superintendent.<\/blockquote><p>One could not make it up.  It comes really close to using the criminal law to punish someone for a virtual offence.  Given the apparent lack of concern with regard to having this kind of injustice baked into the structures of our legal system, it would seem this annual dance is doomed to continue for some time while the underlying causes of the rising crime rates, inequality, outdated drug enforcement legislation, homelessness and the disparity of opportunity in this country all remain thanks to the continuous failure of Government policy.<\/p><p>We came in here in 2011.

They rejected and continue to reject the settlement put in place under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, and subsequent agreements, a settlement aimed squarely at securing peace here in the South and in Northern Ireland.  We badly need that peace, which is fragile.  The concern now about a hard border is fuel for their engines to get them started on a lucrative smuggling trade and other illicit activities along the Border.<\/p>  <p>  I want to highlight also the long and painful struggle that the Omagh victim support group has experienced in trying to establish a cross-Border inquiry into the very atrocity and slaughter that gave rise to the 1998 Act we are discussing here this evening.  I have visited Mr. Michael Gallagher and his colleagues in the North many times.  I brought him here for Leaders' Questions when the Minister's former leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, was Taoiseach.  When in opposition, Deputy Enda Kenny brought him to a Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in 2006 where he pointed him out in the crowd, waved at him and told him that he would not get justice under Fianna F&aacute;il but that he would get it under Fine Gael.  However, when he came into power, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, abandoned him.  I had to bring Mr. Gallagher here so that he could meet him and shake his hand on the corridor but the Taoiseach ran away from him.  All Mr. Gallagher wanted to know was whether he was the same person he had met when he was in opposition.<\/p>  <p>  The cover up and the shenanigans that went on around the Omagh bombing are truly pitiful.  I have met the families involved.  I have met Detective Sergeant White and his family.  I know a fair bit about that atrocity, which should never have happened.  It could have been prevented but it was not.  I support Mr. Gallagher.  I asked the current Taoiseach, on the day he was elected Taoiseach, if he would try to get justice and meet the Omagh bombing victims and families but to no avail.  The shutters came down.  It is very unusual that on the one had we have done so much to address the terrorism problem on this island yet on the other, we still have not adequately responded to some of the families directly affected by the violence.  We forget about them.  We had the debate on the Shane O'Farrell case here last night.  Where is the justice in that case?  At the time of the Taoiseach's appointment, I asked him to demonstrate more effective political support for the victims and families of the Omagh bombing massacre than his predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, promised but did not do.  He literally used them to get votes to get into government, which is despicable.<\/p>  <p>  Moving on from that specific issue, I want to finally acknowledge the views of the Garda authorities and the Garda Commissioner, who, as the report on the operation of the Act makes clear, is of the view that the key provisions of this Act are regularly used in the ongoing investigation of terrorist activity.  I welcome that.  The Commissioner is also of the view that this legislation continues to be one of the most important tools available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the ongoing fight against terrorism.  The Garda Commissioner considers it essential that the relevant provisions of the Act should be extended for a further 12 months.  However, it is not enough to just have an Act on the Statute Book to help the Garda.  It cannot do this unless it has the numbers, the tools of the trade and the basic equipment it needs.  In terms of numbers, there has been a 40% reduction in community policing.  There was a ban on overtime last December, and the Minister knew about it, but figures were used to say it was next year's money.  That was at a time when we are dealing with the most obnoxious, deadly, violent terrorists in this city on a daily basis.  A number of garda&iacute; have told us that lives have been spared over this but they are haemorrhaging members.  The Minister told me he is going to Templemore tomorrow, which I welcome, but they are all young garda&iacute; who need experience.  We are losing the best and the brightest who have the experience.  They were ran out of the job because of cuts, restrictions, lack of support from this House in terms of getting adequate funding, vehicles and other equipment.  <\/p>  <p>  What happened at the Garda Representative Association, GRA, conference recently was pathetic.  We had an officer from the United State of America here.  It is pathetic.  Members of the Garda cannot get simple tools of the trade to protect themselves when they are in the line of duty on our behalf and that of the public.  Marauding gangs are spreading to towns and cities.  I have them in my town of Clonmel, although I am thankful for some action taken today.  The drugs trade is being run by a mob.  Mobs have threatened me because I have asked about legislation here to curtail sulky racing.  That is what we are dealing with.  They are acting above and outside the law.  The garda&iacute; round them up and bring them before the courts but with the revolving door system and free legal aid, they are soon out.  I refer to the debate here last night on the Shane O'Farrell case.  That person had 52 previous convictions.  In a recent case the person had 101 previous convictions but he got free legal aid and bail.  We need to wake up the justice system.  We need to wake up some members of the Judiciary, so to speak, to ensure they are able to deal with this problem.<\/p>  <p>  What is reprehensible is that every day of the week, and there is a silent protest tonight outside Mountjoy, many members of the Garda are accompanying receivers to evict people from their homes.  We are getting it all wrong.  We are persecuting people instead of putting the rogues and vagabonds and terrorists off the road.  Garda&iacute; and members of the regional support unit, RSU, assisted a third force, former British army people, who came down here to evict a family in Balbriggan, and the garda&iacute; stood idly by.  It happened, and the Minister knows it.  There is no point in him shaking his head.  It happened under the Minister's watch.  The garda&iacute; were present.  The car they had was parked in the Garda station.  Those thugs were members of a third force who have no place in this country, no more than the terrorists.  Some of them are former terrorists and former militia and they are terrorising people here who are trying to pay their mortgages.  That happened.  There is no point in the Minister shaking his head.  He knows that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300048#AAA00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909200,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I thank Members for their contributions.  I wish to refer in particular to the Special Criminal Court, as it is relevant to both motions and it exercised some Members.  It is my strong view that jury trial is to be preserved to the greatest extent possible but we simply cannot ignore the threat posed to the normal operation of the criminal process by terrorists and organised criminals who have nothing but contempt for the rule of law in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Criminal Court was established to respond to the threat to the State and its people from republican terrorism over the decades.  It continues to be necessary to deal with the subversive threat from paramilitary groups.  Indeed, the Government recently put the second Special Criminal Court into operation as a necessary response to the volume of cases that needed to be tried.  Some have argued that the Special Criminal Court is no longer needed, that its use is unjustified or even that the Special Criminal Court has been partisan in some way.  I reject the utterly baseless assertion made in this House that the Special Criminal Court has operated with bias.  For the record, its judges have performed courageous public service in presiding without fear or favour over the prosecution of some of the most dangerous terrorists and ruthless criminals in the State.  Are we seriously to accept that the threat from republican paramilitary groups and the brutality of ruthless criminal gangs do not need a particular response from our criminal justice system?  Are we simply to ignore these realities and not retain at our disposal the best means to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the justice system in tackling these threats?  I cannot and will not accept that.<\/p>  <p>  The 1998 Act remains an essential tool in tackling the activities of paramilitary groups across this island.  It is complementary to the general criminal law.  While the provisions may be out of the ordinary course of the criminal law they are not emergency laws, as some have presented them.  Over the course of the State's history, especially during the Troubles on this island, these laws have served to protect and safeguard the State from determined efforts to undermine it and all its democratic institutions.  It is surely beyond reasonable argument that a democratic state is entitled, and must make the measures it considers necessary, to protect itself and fundamental rights and freedoms, and allow civil society to flourish.  I make no apology for defending our laws and the measures we have in place to combat serious crime and terrorism.  The people require us to do what we reasonably can to protect them.<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies here will know from their experience as public representatives the devastation that organised crime in the drugs trade can wreak on individual lives and communities across the State.  We must continue to confront this challenge by providing the necessary resources and legislative supports to combat those who seek to undermine the law and damage lives and communities in doing so.  The renewal of this provision of the 2009 Act is a contribution to the overall framework of measures that seek to tackle the scourge of organised crime.  While we have a comprehensive criminal law regime to tackle serious crime we must constantly see where it might be improved in the light of experience and changes in crime trends.  Our laws in this regard remain under constant review to ensure they are proportionate and effective.  Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to the Omagh group with which he is in contact.  A reply is being prepared and will issue shortly.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in tackling serious crime and terrorism.  We will provide whatever resources are required to keep our people and communities safe.  Some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018, an increase on previous years.  The Garda authorities work very closely with their international colleagues in their efforts to tackle terrorism and organised crime.  It is vital that we continue to enhance the ability of law enforcement and security authorities to make better use of, for example, EU information-sharing databases and resources.  Backed by an allocation of more than &euro;200 million for Garda ICT under the capital plan, a significant programme of work is under way to improve connectivity with a number of the information-sharing databases in use throughout Europe.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I thank the Deputies who support the motions and the continuation of the use of these powers to ensure the protection of communities, the institutions of the State and our people.  I commend the motions to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300049#BBB00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909200,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Is the motion regarding the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 agreed to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300049#BBB00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528909200,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909200,"counter":486,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 14 June 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300049#BBB00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (No. 32 of 2009) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on 30 June 2018 and ending on 29 June 2019.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300049#BBB00450","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528909200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 14 June 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300049#BBB00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1528909200,"counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300049#BBB00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation has completed its consideration of the Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Law Provisions Bill 2018 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300049#BBB00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017: Report Stage (Resumed)","time":1528909800,"counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300050#CCC00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528909800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Bill recommitted in respect of amendments Nos. 4 to 21, inclusive, and amendment No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, line 15, to delete &ldquo;(b) in&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo; (ii) in&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300050#CCC00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528909800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909800,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Will the Deputies claiming a division please rise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300050#CCC00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528909800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Deputies Michael Collins, Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae and Mattie McGrath rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528909800,"counter":498,"content":"<p>As fewer than ten Members have risen I declare the amendment carried.

Increasing working parents' flexibility and choices, and helping to provide them with the opportunity to spend more time with their children, is a worthwhile aim that we all share.  However, as Deputies will appreciate, the development of policy in this area is not straightforward and the legislation is more complex than people realise.<\/p><p>As the House is aware, the Bill seeks to expand the current parental leave allocation from 18 weeks to 26 weeks.  Doing so will place a financial and administrative burden on employers in its own right, but add these eight weeks to the existing provisions for maternity, paternity and carer's leave and existing parental leave entitlements, and the burden becomes significantly bigger.  As I will discuss later in further detail, the Office of the Attorney General has highlighted this issue of the cumulative burden on employers and the risk in terms of constitutionality.  Therefore, we need to ensure the burden on employers is not disproportionate.  To address the needs of businesses and ensure the proposals are proportionate, the Government proposes a phasing in of the expanded entitlements.  I will discuss this staggered approach in more detail shortly when I come to the relevant amendment.<\/p><p>I might also mention the work the Department has engaged in in respect of two other strands of family leave policy.  As the House is aware, the programme for partnership Government includes a commitment to increased paid parental leave during the first year of a child's life, as research shows that children benefit most from parental care at this stage of development.  That is paid parental leave as distinct from this, which is unpaid parental leave.  To further this commitment, the Government established an interdepartmental working group to develop proposals to give effect to the programme commitments.  The group has almost completed its work and is in the process of putting the final touches to its report.  I am sure colleagues will agree with me when I say that paid parental leave is much better for parents and families than unpaid leave.<\/p><p> It is important to note that discussions are ongoing at working group level on the EU proposal for a work-life balance directive.  The most recent draft requires member states to provide for up to 18 weeks of parental leave, two months of which are to be non-transferable between parents, with the two months to be paid at a rate to be determined by member states.  There are still a large number of member states concerned with the significant financial implications of the directive and its impact on existing parental leave systems.  The directive was discussed at the Permanent Representatives Committee yesterday and it will be discussed at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 21 June.  It is an important piece of work in progress.<\/p> <p> I propose to speak to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together.  These are relatively straightforward and with them I propose a slightly cleaner approach to the Long Title of the Bill.  The Title will still reflect that the Bill amends and extends the provisions of the Parental Leave Act 1998 but it will do so in a marginally neater fashion.  Simply put, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 amend the Long Title of the Bill to read \"An Act to amend and extend the Parental Leave Act 1998\".  This is something we all want to do and the Government is interested in doing this with respect to paid parental leave as against unpaid leave.  I have met both employers and employees and they tell me low-paid employees will find it difficult to avail of unpaid leave but they would certainly be interested in paid leave.  It is a Government policy we want to introduce.<\/p> <p> On Second and Committee Stages I said we were concerned about this cutting across the European Union proposal and what we propose ourselves.  As I said at the start, this is complex and we must be careful that we do not cause more damage.  That is why I am talking about phasing it in gradually.  We do not want a constitutional challenge to the legislation later with the risk of it all being thrown out.  According to the Attorney General, there is a risk that this could happen because of the burden it could put on small and other businesses if they had to implement the provisions in one go.  We are making these small changes to the Bill to tidy up the Title of the Bill and make it cleaner but without making a major change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300056#JJJ02000","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528912200,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for speaking to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which have been grouped.  I am happy to support them to ensure the name and Title of the Bill better reflect what is being provided for.  What is being provided for is pretty modest in European terms.  The Minister of State spoke of the importance of paid parental leave and there is no doubt that is true.  All of us would like to see the Government introducing paid parental leave for the first year of a child's life as soon as possible.  It was a commitment in the programme for Government but progress has been pretty slow.  What is being proposed is an extension to the entitlement to unpaid parental leave, which is not an alternative but rather an addition to paid parental leave.  It is a different type of provision entirely, and its purpose is to provide flexibility to parents during a child's life up to the age of 12.  This means that at particular times, perhaps during school holidays or when a child is going through a period or illness, when many different issues arise for parents, there can be flexibility for them so they can balance family responsibilities with work life.  We must bear in mind that we are very much down the table in providing parental leave generally within Europe and there is much catching up to do.<\/p>  <p>  I was surprised by some of the points raised by the Minister of State.  It is a positive aspect of this initiative that it has received cross-party support.  It certainly has much support outside this House among parents who are crying out for this flexibility.  There has been no mention of any kind of constitutional issue up to now and I do not see that there could be any constitutional issue.  The Minister of State also hinted at potential costs, but this was checked beforehand and there is no question of a money Bill.  That advice came from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it has been cleared from that perspective.  Any potential cost on employers would be minimal.  It will not happen that next week all parents will start claiming additional leave, but instead it would happen over a long period of a childhood.  It is a very modest proposal that is about helping parents, many of whom are struggling to juggle different responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that many low-paid parents might not be able to afford to take unpaid leave, but I repeat that this is not a substitute for paid parental leave.  It will be in addition to that leave so it is different.  It is about providing a level of flexibility so that parents have the option of taking time off at different stages.  We can consider the very high cost of child care and sometimes there is very little in the difference if a parent takes a month of the school summer holidays off work to look after children at home.  Taking into consideration tax and the cost of travelling to and participating in work, there may sometimes be very little in the difference.  It is an option open to everybody.  It is a sensible and modest enough move.  I very much welcome the cross-party support we have achieved through Second and Committee Stages and I hope it will continue so we can see the Bill passing Report and Final Stages tonight.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the very strong support that Senator Buttimer has given the Bill.  He has committed to facilitating its early passage through the Seanad before the recess, which would be a very positive development.  There are certainly many parents watching what is happening tonight who will very much welcome these improvements if we can continue to take an all-party approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300057#KKK00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1528912200,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I express our support for the Bill.

This is a vital matter and I have received much lobbying on it.  Both parental leave and parental benefit are important and they must be dealt with equally.  It is clearly more difficult for an Opposition party to bring forward proposals on parental benefit, and that is why this is focused on parental leave.  It is important as well.<\/p>  <p>  There is much that must be done and I welcome the Minister of State's comments on recent meetings.  Ireland ranked 32nd out of 34 OECD states at the end of 2016 with respect to maternity leave.  This may have changed somewhat but we are still at that end of the table.  If a family cannot afford not to work - a reality for many under pressure to pay the mortgage or rent - it can be a difficulty.  The rate is too low and the period for which it is applicable is too short.<\/p><p>It is important to address the issue of parental leave as well as parental benefit.  The flexibility that Deputies O'Sullivan and Shortall have outlined is vitally important in giving people options and flexibility.  Ultimately, between both leave and benefit, we need to work towards a situation whereby there is a single block that can be divided between the parents at their own discretion.  This is something we have asked for.  It is the best model and one that exists in other states.  As I said, it creates choice and flexibility.  A lengthier period of paid leave, as well as, I hope, the Government addressing benefit, will assist families.  In an increasingly stressful world, there needs to be more flexibility for parents to live lives and raise families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300057#KKK00400","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528912800,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I wish to make a number of points about this.  Deputy Shortall has made the point that this is and should be in addition to paid leave.  There is a marked difference in how we approach children and childcare compared with many of our European counterparts, which see people having children as a good thing that needs to be supported in order that society can replenish itself and have people grow up into solid human beings.  These countries take a very good approach to the amount of leave provided in the first few years, particularly in the first year.  I ask the Minister to consider the example of someone who has had a baby and got her maternity leave.  If she has family to mind the baby in order that she can go back to work, that is fine, but for the first year it is in many cases nearly impossible to get a cr&egrave;che place, for example.  Many cr&egrave;ches simply will not take a baby under the age of one.  Furthermore, while very often we try to encourage very practical and positive things for a baby such as breastfeeding, the baby may not be weaned.  This approach allows for what should be very much a child-centred approach.  It seems to me that when it comes to the balance of rights and the balance of how society looks at this, it tends to look at it from an employer's perspective rather than from a child's perspective.  Whereas this is a modest proposal, it is an important one because it may well be that a small number of extra weeks give that flexibility that has been talked about.<\/p>  <p>  There are, therefore, very practical reasons this initiative could be of assistance not to everyone, but certainly to those who can take it up.  A point has been made about the cost of childcare.  Childcare is very expensive anyway, but childcare in year one is particularly expensive, and that is if one can get it.  This is why this flexibility is something that employers should actually welcome, and I am surprised there is any question at all of there being a constitutional issue about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300058#LLL00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1528912800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I thank the sponsors of the Bill for affording me the opportunity to speak.  I did not speak on any of the previous Stages of the Bill.  My two colleagues, Deputies Jim O'Callaghan and Lisa Chambers, represented us on the committee.<\/p>  <p>  I completely concur with everything Deputy Murphy is after saying.  As spokesperson for children, one thing I do know about cr&egrave;ches is that they normally do not take babies of less than nine months of age.  That is part of the rules in most cr&egrave;ches.  In the case of children under the age of one, the adult-to-child ratio must be 1:3, which is most expensive for a cr&egrave;che to operate.  This is what cr&egrave;ches are getting out of the business of doing.  By increasing the entitlement from 18 weeks to 26 weeks, we would basically be affording a family the opportunity to choose to spend the first year of their baby's life with their baby if they want to do so.  I also agree that not every family has that family support in the very beginning whereby they can return to work with the support of either the mother, the father or extended family.  The parents themselves would like to care for their own.  It is also proven statistically that early intervention and minding one's own in the very beginning aids development at key milestones, so the Bill is a very positive step.  It also allows parents flexibility and is about helping them.<\/p>  <p>  I absolutely welcome the Minister of State's comments on the programme for Government and paid leave, but tonight's conversation is about the unpaid aspect of it.  As a mother of three children, I looked forward to the opportunity to take my unpaid leave after my paid leave.  I think parents like that opportunity.  It is a choice; it is not forced on them.<\/p>  <p>  As for employers, it is not a cost to them to give parents unpaid leave.  It is all about how one engages and communicates with one's employer in order that the employer has adequate notice to put provisions in place if it knows the employee is taking that extended time.  In my previous work, we had to give a month's notice before we took the additional unpaid leave.  However, once we did so, the employer was able to make provisions for it.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, this is not the contentious part of the Bill.  I think that will come later.

We must be mindful that EU directives do not crisscross, as he said.  We will talk about that later.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding unpaid leave, I have a staff member who is after having her baby - successfully, thankfully - and who has now gone on to unpaid leave.  There is no issue once there is a genuine understanding and a genuinely good relationship between employer and employee, which we would hope would be the case for the vast majority, and once notice is given in order that replacements can be found or contingency plans made.  Those very early months and weeks of a newborn baby's life are so important, especially for a first-time parent, or even the second time one.  Childcare is so expensive, and many childcare centres will not take small babies.  The conditions and guidelines in this regard are very harsh.  I happen to be chairperson of a community cr&egrave;che - a na&iacute;onra, in fact - and we must have the checks and balances in place in respect of the 1:3 ratio, which is very high and is onerous on the cr&egrave;che.  There is limited space, limited staff and limited funding, and many cr&egrave;ches have been shortchanged in funding in this recent round, including our one.  I have not got the funding that the na&iacute;onra expected or was hoping for, so it is very important that there be unpaid leave and that we deal with the matter here.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of paid leave, which I know we will deal with later, I must declare that I am an employer, a self-employed person, and that there are difficulties in this regard.  While I am not against the concept proposed in the Bill, I am saying it will be onerous on many employers.  While we think we are back in a boom, we are not.  Perhaps we are in this city, but we are certainly not in the parts of Ireland I represent.  It is important we do not overburden small employers in rural areas as well as urban areas.  They are the backbone of our community and our development.  I spoke about them earlier today in the context of the Construction Contracts Act and subcontractors not getting paid when big companies go bust, which is a knock-on effect.  This is a continuum, and a whole aggregation of these issues forces self-employed people and small businesses out of business.  A closed business is no good to the employees, the employer, the taxpayer, the county council or anyone else, so it is very important we make hay slowly.  While we might rank well behind in Europe, we cannot just catch up overnight.  We must have balance.  We need a work-life balance - that is certainly very important - but we also need a balance in respect of the ability or inability of small firms especially to be able to pay the paid leave.

I was just introducing my initial thoughts on the Bill.  It is true that it has had a fairly quick turnaround.  There was no consultation or pre-legislative scrutiny on it.  I said previously at the committee and here that Bills benefit from giving the stakeholders an opportunity to have input into them but that did not happen in this case, unfortunately.  I wanted to flag the issue the Attorney General raised that there may be constitutional issues, and to which I will come back later.  He does not say that lightly.  I do not want to see the Bill ending up in trouble because of those issues.<\/p><p>That is genuinely why I am raising it.  <\/p> <p> Last year we introduced two weeks of paid paternity leave.  There has been a very good take-up.  We must ensure we are in a position to extend it.  I take the point made by Deputies that we have a long way to go in providing for childcare and parental leave.  Several years ago I visited Scandinavia where I studied this issue.  I met people and saw what they did.  Even then they were quite advanced in their thinking.  Teachers in childcare services had master's level qualifications in early childcare education and provision.  Children learn so much at that age.  We, on this side of the House, and I am sure others will agree that in their first year of life children are best placed with their parents.  That is where we want to get to and we want to support families and parents in doing so, but we have a long way to go.  We propose that we do so incrementally, not in one fell swoop.  The unpaid leave is welcome.  Some families will not be able to afford to take it, but some will.  However, I do not want to move our aim away from the ultimate goal which is paid parental leave in order that people will be able to take time off and have the guarantee that rest assured they will be paid.<\/p> <p> There are other issues related to gender equality.  Often mothers take time out to mind the children and their careers slide because they, rather than the father, take so much time off work.  That is an issue and we want to balance it.  There are interesting issues when one begins delving into and discussing the matter.  The gender pay gap also comes into play, as well as the need to ensure there is a balance and that fathers have the opportunity to bond with children.<\/p> <p> Last week the House discussed the issue of maternity leave for politicians.  We are one of the few groups without a right to paternity or maternity leave and it is something we need to address.  We had a very interesting debate on it in Private Members' time a number of weeks ago.  <\/p> <p> I apologise for going over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300058#LLL00500","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528913400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>If everyone is happy, we will move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300059#MMM00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528913400,"counter":644,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528913400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;to extend unpaid parental leave from 18 weeks to 26 weeks; and to provide for related matters&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300059#MMM00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528913400,"counter":646,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528913400,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, to delete line 12 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(a) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (1):<blockquote>&ldquo;(1A) The reference in subsection (1) to a period of 18 working weeks shall be construed&mdash;<blockquote>(a) in the year 2019, as a reference to a period of 20 working weeks,<br \/><br \/>(b) in the year 2020, as a reference to a period of 22 working weeks,<br \/><br \/>(c) in the year 2021, as a reference to a period of 24 working weeks, and<br \/><br \/>(d) on and from 1 January 2022, as a reference to a period of 26 working weeks.&rdquo;,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I propose to discuss amendment No. 3 in isolation.  As colleagues said, it is a subject of some debate.  The purpose of the amendment is to amend the Parental Leave Act 1998 to increase the current 18 week unpaid parental leave entitlement to 26.  The Government proposes that the increase in parental leave be phased in at a rate of two additional weeks per year between 2019 and 2022.  As I have mentioned, while we are all in favour of providing the upmost support for working parents, we must remain cognisant of the potential impact on employers.  As Members will recall, on Committee Stage I invited the views of all stakeholders affected, including employers.  IBEC subsequently made a submission to the Department in which it underlined its key concerns, chief among which are the consequences for employers, particularly small and medium employers.  The big companies will manage, but they were worried about the administrative and cost burdens for small companies.  In the light of the challenges involved in replacing key skills and ensuring alternative arrangements will not result in a loss of productivity or output, IBEC submits that it is vital that any increase be on a phased basis to lessen the impact on employers, especially SMEs.<\/p><p>Deputies will also appreciate that extending parental leave on a phased basis is not only about supporting the interests of business.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the Office of the Attorney General has raised the issue of the cumulative burden on employers and the risk of constitutionality.  <\/p><p>The Bill has moved quite quickly.  In my time in the House I have rarely seen a Bill move as fast, with the exception of emergency legislation.  Unfortunately, there was no consultation or pre-legislative scrutiny, although on Second Stage I suggested strongly that the committee do so.  A phasing-in approach, as proposed by the Government, would enhance the Bill's presumption of constitutionality, as it is contended that phasing in the leave over a four year period, starting on 1 January 2019, would be a proportionate approach and not put a disproportionate burden on employers.  This approach stems from previous case law where, as Deputies will recall, the Supreme Court found it to be unconstitutional to place a disproportionate burden on employers which would cause &quot;undue hardship&quot;.  There is, therefore, a precedent.  <\/p><p>As alluded to previously, negotiations on a draft work-life balance directive are still under way at EU level and the Government wishes to highlight the need to ensure that whatever changes are made to domestic legislation will dovetail with the provisions and timeframe for transposing the directive as far as is practicable.  Negotiations are ongoing on the directive and we are not yet sure what will emerge.  Member states will have three years in which to transpose it into national law; therefore, we are also working at that level on the issue of a work-life balance.  Some member states are concerned about the cost; there are, therefore, considerable negotiations taking place on the issue.<\/p><p>In some ways, the amendment is quite complex and a lot of work went into making it happen.  I am curious to hear what colleagues have to say about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300059#MMM00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1528913400,"counter":648,"content":"<p>As I cannot agree with the points made by the Minister of State on the amendment, I cannot support it for several reasons.  The Minister of State cited the possibility of constitutional difficulties.  This is the first time that he has raised that issue.  We have been through Second and Committee Stages and it never arose.  I am not sure what he is talking about when he refers to a cumulative burden on employers.  People will not rush out and take all of next week off or whenever the legislation becomes law.  In all likelihood, it is something that will be spread over several years.  We are talking about an extension of eight weeks during a child's life, potentially a 12 year period, and about a parent having an additional entitlement to eight weeks leave.  I do not think that is particularly onerous on anybody.  It can be a win-win for employers because very often parents, especially women, find juggling children and work too much.  Because of the lack of flexibility in they system, women often step out of the workforce, might resign from their job and stay out of the workforce for some time.  Employers often invest considerable money in training their staff.  They have loyal and responsible staff who do a good job whom they do not want to lose.  That is why there are benefits for employers if they are in a position to show that flexibility to workers, recognise the realities of life where their staff are parents and that in the real world parents have children who need care and attention and time.  There is no reason it cannot be combined with an active work life.  As I said, it happens across Europe where there are far more generous entitlements to leave which mostly is paid.  <\/p>  <p>  I just do not buy the argument about undue hardship.  I cannot imagine employers heading off to the High Court because a staff member wants to take an occasional few weeks off when their children are on school holidays or when there are other reasons a parent wants a little flexibility.  I wonder from where these arguments are coming.  The Minister of State is making this overly complex and I think he is bending over backwards to facilitate employers at the expense of employees.  He says the ultimate goal is to provide for paid parental leave.  Nobody disagrees with that goal and the sooner the Government legislates in that area the better.  We will very much welcome it and the Minister of State will receive the full support of the rest of the House.<\/p><p>However, as I pointed out earlier, this is something different.  It is about that flexibility during a child's first 12 years.  The other point I would make is that what the Minister of State is proposing in the amendment is entirely unreasonable.  This Bill is proposing an additional eight weeks that can be spread over a 12-year period.  As I have said earlier, and as others have said, this is a very modest proposal.  It is not a new proposal.  We did not have questions being raised about constitutional issues, employers taking us to court or whatever when the original 14 weeks entitlement was introduced nor when that entitlement to 14 weeks was increased to 18 weeks.  None of these questions was raised at the time.  It is accepted practice that when a new entitlement is introduced it will incrementally improve and increase over the years as we become, as a society, more progressive and, it is to be hoped, more family-friendly.<\/p> <p> As I have said, this is not new.  I cannot see a difficulty with it.  We are talking about a substantial period over which the leave can be taken.  What the Minister of State is proposing is that we move in baby steps in extending this entitlement.  He is talking about phasing that modest eight weeks over the next four and a half years.  For goodness sake, let us be reasonable about this.  Let us recognise the difficulties and the important role parents have in looking after their children.  Let us be fair and balanced about it.  What the Minister of State is proposing is not acceptable by any standards.  Certainly when it has been mooted in recent weeks the reaction to it from parents has been very negative.  There has been a lot of activity on social media and I think we have all received representations from parents.  It is just not on to talk about this modest development being stretched out over such a long period of time.  <\/p> <p> I hope that in the spirit of new politics and co-operation within the House, the Minister of State will recognise the strong views expressed by all other parties here.  We want to facilitate parents and to do it in a reasonable and responsible way.  That is what is being proposed.  I cannot see there being too much support for what the Minister of State is proposing to do here because it is unreasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300059#MMM00800","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528914000,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I was very interested to listen to the Minister of State's comment that his preference is for - if I am quoting him right - one parent or both to be at home with all babies in the first year.  I personally can see the attractiveness of that because I believe that children benefit tremendously from parents being at home.  However, I have to be honest and say that we need to leave real choice.  Every family is different and in some instances it may actually be better, because of a whole range of circumstances, for both parents to be working, even within the first year.<\/p>  <p>  I was surprised at the Minister of State's comment in a sense because, from my perspective, the Government is all about labour activation.  It is all about getting everyone to work.  The Government is backed up in that by the European Union, the OECD, IBEC and ICTU.  We saw the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, last week suggest that child benefit be taken off some groups of parents and the money put into childcare.  I thought that would just accentuate the ongoing discrimination against parents in the home that I see in the system.  It caught me in a sense when I heard that.  We should not have any discrimination.  We should leave as free a choice as possible to parents.  <\/p>  <p>  The attractiveness of this provision to extend parental leave is that it is not mandatory.  Not everyone will take it.  There may be people who choose not to take it for work reasons.  Employees will have to decide and they may decide, for a whole variety of different reasons, that it is better for them to go back to work or that it is better for them not to.  We need to give freedom of choice to parents.  We should do that straight away.  I do not think it will cripple the Irish economy.  If anything it might help it in the long run.  Giving choice and the freedom of choice is important.  In respect of those who want to avail of the additional parental leave, I do not see why we should give some people the choice in four years' time but not next year.  We should do it straight away.  It is about flexibility and providing parents with the ability to choose what is best for them, and they invariably know what that is.  In some instances that will be going back to work and in other instances it will be availing of this leave.  The provision does not provide any particular financial benefits.  We should give them that choice.  I do not agree with any delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300060#NNN00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1528914000,"counter":651,"content":"<p>We are discussing and debating an amendment from the Minister of State which would phase in the increase in unpaid parental leave over the period from 2019 to 2022.

The idea that it has to be phased in not over one or two years, but over several years is not acceptable to us and is not acceptable to parents.  Anyone who has sounded out parents on this issue will know that reasonable people feel that this is an unreasonable proposal.  The argument seems to be very much influenced by the views of some employers and some employer organisations.  There are few, if any, employers in the country who would not be in a position to afford what is in reality a very modest proposal.  If the Minister of State was concerned about the ability of some small businesses to afford this in the immediate short term he might bring a proposal before the House for some kind of short-term temporary subsidy.  We would look at that on its merits.  I personally do not think it would be necessary given the modest arrangements being put forward here.

This would facilitate parents.  In terms of the problems for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, there is generally a fairly good personal relationship between the employer and the employees in small businesses.

We have to bear in mind that already we have 26 weeks' paid maternity leave, a possibility of 16 weeks of unpaid maternity leave, 18 weeks of paternity leave, and two weeks of paid paternity leave.

It states the Act shall come into operation on 1 January 2019, for the following reasons.  In the first instance, there is a serious technical issue with section 3 in that an Act cannot come into operation after its passing as proposed in the Bill as the Act needs to be signed by the President to be enacted and to have legal force.  As Deputies will be aware, Article 13.3.1&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann states every Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas shall require the signature of the President before its enactment into law.  Section 3(3) of the Bill provides that the Act comes into operation three months after its passing, not after its enactment.  In short, an Act can come into operation only after enactment, not after its passing by the Houses of the Oireachtas, as proposed in the Bill.  To allow section 3(3) of the Bill to stand would essentially mean the Bill would bypass the President and his functions under the aforementioned article of the Constitution.

Section 41 of the 1994 Act allows the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detain a vehicle in certain circumstances.  These include cases where the vehicle is not taxed or insured or does not display a national car test, NCT, certificate when it should.  Detention can also happen in cases where the member has reason to believe that the person has been disqualified from driving or where the person refused to produce a driving licence or learner permit and the member has reason to believe that, due to their age, the driver cannot be licensed to drive.<\/p>  <p>  At present, however, the power to detain a vehicle does not extend to a vehicle driven by an unaccompanied learner driver.  I believe this is an omission we should rectify.  Imagine the scene at the roadside.  A learner driver has been intercepted driving unaccompanied.  The terms and conditions of a learner permit are clear and say that a person who has a learner permit should be accompanied.  These people are therefore driving in an illegal way.  It is wrong, irresponsible and dangerous.  I do not believe anyone expects a garda dealing with a situation like this to take the person's details and let them drive off.  How can they when the person does not have an accompanying driver?<\/p>  <p>  I will explain briefly how this will work in practice.  The rules will be exactly the same as those applying under section 41 if the vehicle is detained on any of the other grounds under that section.  The vehicle will be towed away for storage.  The owner will then be able to come and reclaim it.  They will have to pay a charge for the removal and storage.  If it turns out that the vehicle was incorrectly detained, there will be no charge for removal or storage.  How could it be incorrectly detained?  It is obvious that if a vehicle is detained because it is thought to be uninsured and the owner subsequently proves that it was insured at the time it was detained, it should not have been so detained and all charges are waived.  In the case of unaccompanied learners, it might be that the learner had a qualified accompanying driver with them but the accompanying driver did not produce a licence and the member on duty did not accept that the accompanying driver was qualified.  If the licence was later produced when the car was being retrieved from storage, there would be no charges.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 41, the Garda has the power to dispose of a vehicle if it was not claimed within a certain period.  This period is set in section 41 as being either three weeks or two weeks after a notice of disposal is sent to the owner, whichever is longer.<\/p>  <p>  The reason the Oireachtas chose to act against unaccompanied learner drivers in 2016 was the risk that they can pose to themselves and others, particularly in the light of the appalling Clancy case where mother and daughter, Geraldine and Louise Clancy, lost their lives in an incident caused by an unaccompanied learner driver.  Learner drivers are just that - people who are learning to drive.  This is why the law requires them to have a qualified driver accompanying them whenever they drive.<\/p>  <p>  Unaccompanied learner driving is illegal and it is dangerous.  We need to get the false notion out of people's heads that once someone has a learner permit they are free to drive as they wish.  A learner permit is not a licence.  It is not something to use for commuting or leisure unless the learner has someone to accompany them.  People who have said that somehow putting an end to unaccompanied learner driving will make life harder for people are missing the point.  It will make them focus on learning and on getting a full licence and it will make them and all the rest of us safer.<\/p>  <p>  I want to tackle the bizarre suggestion that this measure will in some way put farmers out of business because of the seizure of vital farm equipment.  It has even been suggested in some quarters that garda&iacute; will be entering farmyards to seize tractors driven by learners.  We hear a lot these days about false news or scare tactics but these claims really take the Oscar.  Road traffic law applies to public places.  That means public roads and public car parks.  It does not apply to farmyards, backyards, fields, front gardens, back gardens or anywhere else which is private land.  The idea that garda&iacute; could enter a farmyard and seize vehicles driven there by unaccompanied learners is nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the question of what is an unaccompanied learner.  Learners in some categories of vehicles such as cars have to have a qualified driver accompanying them.  For some categories they do not.  For example, learner motorcyclists do not have to have a qualified driver with them for reasons which must be obvious.<\/p><p>Learner tractor drivers do not either.  Why is that?  The people of rural Ireland know, even if those who claim to represent them apparently do not, that tractors have traditionally been built with one seat.  Some tractors can take a passenger and the rules state that if a learner tractor driver has a passenger with him or her that person must be a qualified driver.  However, we do not require a learner tractor driver to be accompanied by a qualified driver for the obvious reason that in most cases it is not possible.  I trust the good sense of the people of rural Ireland to know that and not to be frightened by these absurd and alarmist claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300062#PPP01500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528915800,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 22:<\/p><blockquote>In the fifth line of subparagraph (iv), proposed to be inserted by section 3(c), after &ldquo;No. 537 of 2006).&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Provided that the provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply in circumstances where a driving test date has not been supplied to an applicant within a period of six weeks from the date of their application.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister spoke about people being reckless and unaccountable.  It is reckless that the State has failed to give young drivers a test.  They go through all the procedures and then apply for their test.  Currently, there are youngsters waiting up to six months to get a test.  That has been proven.  When new laws are being introduced new solutions must also be introduced.  The problem is that even though these youngsters have done everything by the book as they were required to do, the State is failing in its obligation to give them a test even in a medium amount of time, which I would consider to be six weeks.  There should be no reason for the State not being in a position to do that.<\/p><p>We constantly hear promises that more driver testers will be recruited, which is good, but the figures show that the situation is not improving.  In fact, it is getting worse.  If a youngster has gone through the different steps of getting their 12 driving lessons from a driving instructor, learning the rules of the road and doing everything he or she is supposed to do and is willing to sit a test, the State should have an obligation to provide it.  It is recklessness and unaccountability on the part of the State.  The State should give them the opportunity to do it within six weeks but it is leaving them for 19 or 20 weeks without a test even though they are ready for it.  Before we impose rules on youngsters we should ensure that we have the procedures and enough driver tester personnel in place around the country. <\/p><p>The Minister referred to tractors and it is good that it is clarified.  Many people did not know if it affected tractors, but it is good to know it does not have an effect if there is a single seat in it.  The Minister said there is to be an accompanying driver.  I believe we should be considering new ideas.  I should be as good a driver two days before I pass the test as on the day I pass it, if I am going to pass it.  I have said time and again that we should have a system whereby in places such as Mondello Park and other places in the west, south and north one can do an advanced type of driving course with a driving instructor so if the State is unable to give somebody the test the driving instructor could say that in his or her opinion a person is fit or able.  One gets a piece of paper on the day one passes the test.  Obviously, one has to be as good on the day before it but one does not have that piece of paper in one's hand.  The big blockage is the failure of the State to ensure that these youngsters are given the opportunity.  That is all we are seeking.  Nobody is saying they should be able to travel around on the road in one way or another.<\/p><p>When I and other Deputies talk about rural Ireland we understand it.  The Minister seems to be throwing shots across the bow at different public representatives about rural Ireland.  To be quite blunt, between potholes in the roads and the different legislative measures being introduced, if the Minister is left much longer in his job he will be remembered in rural Ireland but it will be for the wrong reasons.  As has been the case for many years, and I have made this very clear, there are parents in parts of rural Ireland who may have an income of &euro;12,000 to &euro;18,000.  Their child might get the opportunity to go to college.  The Minister will be well aware of the price of accommodation in Dublin and in other places around the country where there are colleges.  Unfortunately, many parents cannot afford it.  There is no point in beating around the bush about what has happened down through the years - a car was bought and the youngster would drive to college.  We must ensure that we give such youngsters an equal opportunity, whether they live in Dublin, Donegal or Kerry, to do the test as quickly as possible.  That piece of paper is a life saver and might be the difference between a youngster going to college or not going to college.<\/p><p>We can introduce laws and that is fine.  After that, however, the State does not seem to be bothered.  The law is in place and the State talks about recruiting driving instructors or driver tester personnel over the following six, eight or 12 months, but a large number of youngsters are seeking to do driving tests at present and, unfortunately, that facility is not available.  To compound that we introduced something that has blocked the system further.  There are many drivers who were backing trailers all their lives and then found out that they did not have it on their licence.  They are seeking to sit a test.  This issue should be checked in the different Departments, not just the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is also a matter for the county councils.  The licences were shredded and the councils cannot now tell people if it was before 1991 or 1992 when they got their licences.  That is a problem in various places.  The councils went from paper to computerised records and whatever happened in the meantime - I am not blaming the Department - many people are now caught as a result of not having the information they should have.<\/p><p>The Department and especially the RSA talk about safety.  The first thing I would do is ensure that there is no excuse for not being able to take a test.  We should make sure that facility is available.  Why is there such a big problem with a lack of driver testers?<\/p><p>Is it that there is not a budget or driving testers?  There are many people around the country who are well qualified at driving that it does not take a year to get up to the spec that is required with the amount of licences.<\/p> <p> Even in Dublin there is a shortage of testers.  It is depriving youngsters of an equal opportunity if they are going to college or getting a job.  Every Deputy gets phone calls every day of the week from people waiting for a driving test.  It should be the number one priority to say that by next September we will guarantee every person that they will have a test within six weeks.  If the Minister can do that, he can ensure he enforces whatever laws he wants to introduce.  We are doing one thing on the one hand without solving the problem.  This has not just happened in the Minister's time; I am not having a go at him about this.  This goes back for a while.<\/p> <p> The waiting time for a driving test is getting longer and longer.  It is possible to get the theory test within a few days.  It is a great facility and well set up.  A person who gets less than 35 questions right out of 40 can be back again the following week.  We need concrete information that within three months, nobody will be waiting for longer than six weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300063#QQQ00200","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528916400,"counter":698,"content":"<p>The Deputy has made his case very powerfully.

I accept the criticisms made by virtually every Member of this House.  I also accept the case made by virtually every Member of the House that the driving test waiting list is too long.  The Deputy talked about a six-month period.  I think that is the highest possible one.  The objective of the RSA is ten weeks and the average is around 12 to 14 weeks.  That is still not an acceptable level.  We should certainly aim to come down to six weeks and we are not there.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA has recently taken measures involving extra overtime for existing driving testers, which will bring the waiting time down.  It is gradually introducing new systems to allow tests to be done on a self-appointment basis.  In other words, applicants can do it all on the Internet and fill in the gaps that way, rather than making an appointment.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA has also taken measures to eliminate the no-shows, which represented a very large number of those applying for tests.  No-shows were a big problem.  Measures have now been taken whereby it contacts all those who are coming up for a test and those who are likely to be no-shows because of their records.  Those are also reducing in numbers.<\/p>  <p>  I accept Deputy Fitzmaurice's criticisms.  It is a fair criticism to say that the waiting list for tests is too long.  It is a fair criticism to say it is not reducing quickly enough.  However, this does not justify by any stretch of the imagination putting a lethal vehicle such as a car in the hands of someone who is patently judged not fit to drive it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300064#RRR00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1528916400,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this.  I am sorry to say that I was unhappy with what the Minister said in the first place and I am still unhappy with his response to Deputy Fitzmaurice.  We need to go back to the nub of the argument the Minister is making with regard to this proposal.  The Minister is making an assumption that an accident involving an unaccompanied driver would not have happened if he or she had a fully qualified driver with them.  I cannot agree with the criminalising and the targeting of young people.<\/p>  <p>  I will say one thing about our young people.  Every one of us had to start somewhere, whether it was driving a motorcar or a tractor, or getting up on a digger.  Every one of us had to do something for the first time.  None of us came into this world being able to perform the tasks that we might do now at our ease.  Everybody has to start somewhere.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why the Minister is targeting our young people - the people we cherish, the people we want to stay here, the people we want to encourage to work.<\/p>  <p>  What about young people in the constituency I am very proud to represent, living down in Tuosist or in Valentia Island or any part of Kerry, be it east, north, south or west, if they are fortunate enough to get a bit of a part-time job or want to go helping an uncle or an aunt?  If it means travelling a bit and if they want to make a bit of money, is the Minister seriously saying they must pass the test at a time when they are told they cannot have their test because they have to wait?  In saying that, I want to compliment the people carrying out the tests in Kerry, but unfortunately they are not being given the resources to allow them to carry out tests in a reasonable length of time and that is why people have to wait for too long.<\/p>  <p>  What the Minister is telling these people who need to travel, whether it is going to college to further their education, get on in life and get their leg up on the ladder or whether it is to go to work?  The Minister and his colleagues in government and the people who support them who come from rural areas, often go into and out of the farmyards that the Minister spoke about a while ago.  When an election is called, they will go into those yards and will seriously look at those parents and say, \"Well, we're the people who supported Minister Ross when he wanted to criminalise you, we backed him, we voted for him and the whole way of life of your young people is being upset because of what has been done inside in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am extremely sorry for any person who loses his or her life on our roads.  None of us wants to see a parent losing anybody belonging to them.  We do not want to see anybody dying on our roads.  However, unfortunately it has happened and always will happen, despite everybody's best efforts quite simply because accidents do happen.  To try to put this down on young people and say that it is okay to pass this provision and target young people, that it is okay to paralyse them and leave them in such a way - the Minister should think about the practicality of what he is suggesting.  On the one hand they cannot sit the test, because the place is not there for them to sit the test immediately when they want to.  So they have a provisional licence.  The Minister is saying then that if they are getting up early in the morning and if they have a job or if in the evening time they get work and want to go work, they cannot drive to work.<\/p><p>They have to get their mother, father, aunt, uncle or somebody else with a full licence to sit in with them.  This may work in this city where people have many transport options but in the county I represent we do not have those methods of transport.  If a parent in Boheshill or Glencar wants to send a young person out to work or, more importantly, the young person wants to go himself or herself, how is he or she supposed to do so?  It is not practical or sensible that a parent would have to accompany that person.  The current system is working.  It is not broken.  Trying to blame every accident on young people is not fair or right.  <\/p> <p> As I said earlier, everyone of us had to start somewhere.  In rural areas, in particular on farms, the younger a person sits behind the wheel of a car the better.  I am speaking in this regard of off-road driving.  The younger he or she is trained the better.  One cannot buy that type of training.  The first time a young person reared in an urban area might sit behind the wheel of a car is when he or she obtains a provisional licence.  I believe this person is at a disadvantage in comparison with the person who might have had an opportunity to sit behind the wheel of a car from a very young age, accompanied, perhaps, by a parent explaining how the car works.  Everyone in my family learned to drive off-road at a very young age, as did my own children.  All of my children were capable of driving from a very young age.  If they were not, there would have been something drastically and radically wrong.  The longer children in rural areas are driving in farmyards and off-road the better because it is educational and good for them.  It prepares them for travelling on the road.  I recognise that not everybody has that opportunity, which is all the worse for them.  <\/p> <p> In terms of what the Minister is trying to do, I am sorry for the people of Ireland who are upset by it.  The Minister is not 100% at fault in this regard because he could not do this without the backing of the Government, which he is supporting, along with some Opposition Deputies, which they are perfectly entitled to do.  All Deputies have their own mandates.  They are here representing people but they seem to be representing a different group of people to those I represent.  As the Minister knows, I am working on the ground every day of the week from early morning to late at night seven days per week.  I adore the job of representing the people of Kerry.  As long as they continue to elect me, I will speak on their behalf.  As I said, I believe what the Minister is doing is hurtful.  Time will prove what he is doing to be wrong.  Despite his best efforts there will continue to be accidents.  To insinuate that a young driver will not be involved in an accident when accompanied by a person with a full licence is wrong and misguided.  The Minister is misleading people and he is going after young people when he should not be doing so.  <\/p> <p> If I had all night I could not explain how hurtful and wrong this is.  I plead with the Minister to even at this late stage see the error of what he is doing and to understand it is wrong.  I plead with him to relent and to listen to people who are proposing other options.  There are other ways of dealing with these matters.  For example, the Minister could come into this House tomorrow morning with proposals to properly resource driver testing centres so that people can have an opportunity to sit their driver test at the earliest opportunity and if they fail it they will have the opportunity to take a retest almost immediately.  Practical, sensible measures such as this would make sense.  <\/p> <p> Unfortunately, when it comes to road safety we have gone crazy.  For example, when lorries and buses are tested and certified roadworthy they can be stopped on the road the following day and rechecked, which does not make sense.  Unfortunately, authorities such as the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which were set up with good intentions, are losing the run of themselves.  When it comes to road safety people operating businesses, be it buses, lorries or hackneys, have to negotiate many hoops.  We all want to ensure that vehicles that are operated for reward meet all safety standards and are certified roadworthy but even when these vehicles are tested and certified roadworthy they can be hauled in for a recheck. This is a money making racket.  It is about time somebody in the Minister's position examined what is happening to these law abiding, decent people who are keeping this Government and the country going.

I am talking about things in a sensible way and I am asking the Minister to look at other aspects of road safety that he is not looking at.  Since becoming Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has concentrated on a very narrow focus of road safety.  Many times I have stood up in this House and pointed out that driving a car is one of the sure things young people will do and I have asked the Minister why he and the Minister for Education and Skills do not work together and put road safety and driving cars on the school curriculum, again, from a very early age.  Why should young people not be taught the ins and outs of road safety while at school?  In the past number of years, I have not heard a Minister make that suggestion in this House or agree to take on board that suggestion when I and others made it.  If the Minister is about saving lives, he should be looking at every aspect of road safety and not one particular aspect of it, which is what he and the people supporting him have been doing.  I do not understand why he does not broaden his focus.<\/p>  <p>  There are so many other reasons for accidents on our roads.  Sadly, a couple were fatally injured on our roads today.  We do not want to see this happening but I do not believe the measures the Minister is hoping to introduce will prevent accidents.

Why not consider all the other issues that have been raised during these debates, which have gone on but rightly so?  What the Minister is hoping to do will change things forever in rural Ireland which has been hit hard enough for long enough.  Each person can speak only for their own area.  I have seen the accidents that have happened over the years and have known the cause of many of them.  In many cases the truth of what happens goes unreported.  It seems to be grabbing headlines that the Minister's solution will fix everything on our roads.  That is so wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to see the Minister tackle issues that I and others have raised tonight, and will continue to raise.  He should be looking at a bigger picture and not concentrating on what he is doing at present.  The Minister is probably burnt out from this but the hardship he is about to impose will never be underestimated.  Like any rule or regulation, once it comes in, if it comes in, it will be very hard to reverse.  It will make our place more unattractive for our young people.  Where I am from we have lost many people who left because there was no work for them.  They went to England, Australia, America and other parts of Europe.  I would give my back teeth to see those people here again.  Unfortunately, however, they have started new lives and now we might also lose the next generation.  It is sad that grandparents and potential grandparents will not have their grandchildren growing up here.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is ensuring that young people starting out will say to hell with this, if they are from a country area, living with their parents and see that they cannot travel to work, will not be allowed on the road, cannot sit their driving test and get their full licence, and they will decide to chance their arm in Australia for a few months.  If they do that they might never come back.  This could have the knock-on effect of robbing us of more people who we want to keep in our countryside, in Ireland.  They are the taxpayers, politicians and teachers of the future.  They are the people we will rely on.  We are only on a wheel, we will not be here forever.  All I want is to see those people here to replace every one of us, myself and the Minister included.  They will not be there if the Minister is going to hunt them, which is exactly what will happen.  It is wrong and unfair.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to please look at this again and take on board the opinions I have given him in a cool, calm and reasoned way.  I speak on behalf of many people.  I would not mislead the Minister, as he knows in his heart and soul.  Many people are talking about this and are upset about it.  They believe the Minister is misguided in what he is trying to do.  They are not nasty about it and I am not nasty about it, as the Minister knows.  I am being very reasonable and pleading with him.  He has the power, as Minister, and I plead with him to look at this again and not to discourage our young people from living here, not to criminalise their hard working parents, not to tie them up in more red tape and bureaucracy and laws, all in the interest of road safety when we all know it will not lead to our roads being safer.  There is so much other work that can be done on our roads to make them safer.  For instance, one of the most basic things that could be done tomorrow morning would be to tell every local authority to keep water off the roads and keep hedges cut on narrow country roads.

I have been asking the Minister for a long time to address consolidation of road traffic legislation.  On its website, the Law Reform Commission appends all the changes that have been made to the Act since 1994, through the Bills passed since then.  As that is the case, is it not possible for the Minister to ask the Law Reform Commission to make a full consolidation instead of having the House consider road traffic Bills almost annually?  We could have all road traffic Acts in one convenient consolidated Bill, as was done, for example, with the Companies Act 2014 and other legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice made the reasonable point that several thousand drivers continue to drive on repeat learner permits.  They are, however, entitled to a speedy test.  The Minister should address that in the Bill. <\/p>  <p>  I also agree with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae on driver education.  Purchasing a house and looking after the household and homestead and purchasing and looking after and driving a vehicle are perhaps the two most important transactions in a person's life.  It is reasonable to expect that the educational system should focus on that.  It should be an important part of second level education.  <\/p>  <p>  There was a horrendous tragedy on the Inishowen Peninsula where a teenager was killed driving a vehicle unaccompanied. <\/p><p>It brings home to us the urgent need to address the situation.  People have referred in the past to joyriding and to unaccompanied driving at a very young age.  This can result in a horrendous tragedy for the family, the district and the child.  The Minister has set out a reasonable case as to why we should proceed.  Looking at the practice across the rest of the European Union, it is interesting that in most countries preparation for driving is an educational process that one goes through.  One then proceeds to obtain one's licence.<\/p> <p> The main point is that this House tried to legislate for this area in the 2016 Act with an amendment in Deputy Imelda Munster's name.  That Bill passed and was signed by the President.  The same happened with the rickshaw issue.  It is incredible that we have had to go back over this ground at such length.  I refer to the section in the 1994 Act and the detention of vehicles and giving additional power to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of unaccompanied drivers.  We could have dealt with this more expeditiously.  The D&aacute;il tried to do so in the 2016 Bill.  The Minister and the Minister for Justice and Equality have given us the figures in respect of unaccompanied young people who tragically have been killed and seriously injured over the past six or seven years.  It is an area of road safety we can address and we should do so with this amendment and the final amendment.<\/p> <p> Most of these debates have been attended by Mr. Noel Clancy and his daughter and the relatives of victims of tragic road crashes.  It would be fitting that we listen to their pleas and those of tens of thousands of families affected by serious road crashes and fatalities and that we would accept the Minister's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300066#TTT01700","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528918200,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I delighted to be able to speak on amendment No. 22, which relates to drivers with an L plate.  I am disappointed, however.  The Minister had an opportunity last night - he was allowed ten minutes - to respond to some of our questions but he chose not to do so.  Deputy Broughan intervened as well.  We have asked many questions during the course of the debate, including on Committee Stage, when were allowed to speak as non-members of the committee.  Privately, I have had long discussions with the Minister, Deputy Ross, on this.  I am disappointed he was unable to have a proper discourse on this legislation.  We all want to make the roads safer.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, I totally condemn anyone who drives recklessly, uninsured or drunk.  I refer to people injured and hurt and I sympathise with Mr. Clancy and his daughter.  Deputy Healy-Rae just informed us that two more people lost their lives on the roads today, of which I was not aware.  It is a huge, complex and multifaceted problem.<\/p>  <p>  We are passing this legislation even though the Minister is only two years in office.  While I appreciate that, I have a document relating to the commencement of sections of legislation, which is relevant.  I mention the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 and the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (Roadside Enforcement) Regulations 2018.  I mention also the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Act 2014, which was enacted over four years age.  All this legislation is under the Minister's Department.<\/p>  <p>  I asked about the Construction Contracts Act 2013 earlier today, which is badly needed.  We pass Bills, and it may be the same with this one, but when are they commenced?  I refer to sections of the Road Traffic Act 2016.  I have been delving into the sections of many Bills but this issue relates to transport.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the issue of L plates.  I have great admiration for young people.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  Driving is an important skill to have and that applies whether one is living in Dublin, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Thurles, Nenagh, Rearcross or elsewhere.  Young people are entitled to respected and to be allowed to drive.  Many young people in the country, especially if they are farmers or are friends of farmers, get great experience on the land and not on the road.  That is from a young age and they are accompanied and trained well.<\/p>  <p>  Nowadays one has to have 12 lessons from an officially recognised tester.  That is good legislation and is very important and valuable for young people because they get that tuition.  Parents might not always be the best teachers.  I have a family of eight and many of them did not get those lessons but got them from my wife or myself.  Since that legislation came in, 12 lessons have to be obtained from approved testers and that can cost anywhere from &euro;350 to &euro;500.  It is a lot of money but it is money well spent.  Like Deputy Healy-Rae and others, I am anxious that we have simulator testing on the syllabus in schools.  The Abbey School in Tipperary town has had that for a number of years for transition year, TY, students.  It created a track as it was lucky to have the space.  An experienced driving instructor comes in and the students do that as part of their TY studies.  That is a very good programme of which I am all in favour.  Some of the students, however, do not get as much benefit from some of the courses as they should.  This, however, is a practical, hands-on course.  Girls and boys learn to drive, pay for lessons and get good experience from the tester, Mr. Joe Quinn.  He has arranged this with the school, which I salute.  We need more of that.  The Buttimer family in Cahir is applying for a new racing track.  The planning application mentioned that it is hoped to use that track as a simulator course for young people to learn how to drive.<\/p>  <p>  It is not only young people who need to learn to drive but some older people as well.  We have people returning from America and different places.  If they are gone for a number of years, they lose their licence.  They have to start off with the theory test, which was not there when I did my test.  It only came in quite recently.  They have to do lessons before they do their test.  There are many things that can be beneficial.  We would have liked to have worked with the Minister on this but he refused to engage or to discuss it with us.<\/p>  <p>  The delay in getting a driver test is a big issue.  It is the same no matter what age one is but more often it affects young people.  It varies across the country.  I do not always listen to Mr. Joe Duffy on \"Liveline\" but recently there was a debate on the programme about failure rates.  They are very alarming in some places.  They vary greatly between urban areas and between rural areas.  We had a second test centre in Tipperary when the national car test, NCT, centre opened.  We lobbied the Minister and another centre was provided in Cahir but it was closed a year or two later.  I think the reason was that there were no traffic lights in the town other than pedestrian crossings.  I am not sure but it was alleviating the waiting list and backlog in Tipperary.<\/p><p>I know the testers, and there is not a week that goes by that parents or the young people themselves are not looking for an appointment to take a driving test.  They have to wait to get it.  It is daunting.  I remember quite well doing my test.  One gets nervous, like any test.  There is competition and a person can feel a bit on edge.  He or she is driving, doing his or her best, but cannot communicate with the tester.  If a person fails the test, he or she cannot reapply for a full month.  That person will have done the theory test and taken all the lessons, which takes a good number of months.  He or she builds up confidence and gets the sign-off from the driving instructor when ready.  The driving instructors use their intuition, and I praise them for the help, encouragement and enthusiasm they give to those young people, and indeed to new drivers from here and abroad.<\/p> <p> When those people go for the test, many anomalies crop up.  I read out a list of such anomalies on the previous occasion, and I do not want to be repetitive.  People fail tests because the rubber has gone off the little handle that allows the seat to go backwards and forwards, or because there is a cap on an expansion tank overflow.  This can happen to a car that passed the NCT four days earlier.  Are we contradicting or overriding the NCT tests?<\/p> <p> There are other inconsistencies in testing.  There is often no shed or covered area available to inspect the car in.  I am aware of many people who have turned up, by appointment, for tests on a wet day.  Those people did not choose the weather but there was no visual inspection of the car because it was too wet.  I am aware of one instance where a person travelled to the testing centre in Clonmel only for the tester to decide that it was too foggy, even though the person had to drive to the centre from Cappawhite, which is 30 miles, with an accompanying driver in the fog.  Driving is done in all kinds of conditions.  It is not easy.  I am aware of someone who failed because it was too frosty.<\/p> <p> I agree with the Minister when he says that no-shows must be punished and taken out of the system, because they are taking slots from others.  I fully accept that.  Those people should be able to give notice.  Of course, something might happen on the morning of the test, such as an accident or the person being ill, but I do not give any credit to people who decide not to do the test because they want to delay it and do not inform the test centre.  That is a slot gone for someone else.<\/p> <p> On the previous occasion I gave the Minister figures on the number of testers that have been recruited since 2014.  I asked him a question and he did not answer it.  Of the 26 recruited, only a small number had been put to work.  Even though they applied and got the job they were not functioning as employees.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether there is an issue with the trade unions.  I do not know whether there is an issue, but I have heard it suggested, and I would be very concerned if that was the case.  Everybody who cannot get a test is being discommoded.  I would like to see a system in place where a person can book a test once he or she has completed his or her lessons.<\/p> <p> If a person fails for one of the reasons I mentioned, including the weather or an inspection which reveals that some manual instrument in the car is not working, there should be a fail advisory issued.  If one is good enough to drive, a fail advisory should be issued and the problem could be sorted out.  To fail the whole test and have to go back through the system again for a month is wrong.  For that month that person in rural Ireland, who may have failed for something I feel should be advisory, is going to be criminalised, especially if his or her parents, guardians or somebody else he or she trusts in his or her friendship circle cannot be with him or her.  That is very unfair.  The legislation the Minister is introducing is going to criminalise that person, and indeed the car owner, if he or she is stopped at a checkpoint without a full licence.  Parents ring me all the time - I am sure the same is true for other Deputies - whose children have just finished secondary school and who hope to go for an apprenticeship or college, and if they want to travel-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300067#UUU00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528918800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but it is now 10.15 p.m. and we must conclude our business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300068#VVV00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1528918800,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I would appreciate it if the Minister could address some of the issues being put to him next time he speaks, rather than just blaming us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300068#VVV00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528918800,"counter":730,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528918800,"counter":731,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 June 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
