May I introduce our team, Ms Dara Deering, head of retail banking, Mr. Barry D'Arcy, our chief risk officer, Mr. Brendan Mahon, the head of our arrears solution team and myself, Peter Roebben, the chief executive officer, CEO, of KBC Bank Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We understand the importance of these hearings and of the role of members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  As elected politicians, the members represent our customers and the people of Ireland and we appreciate this opportunity to engage with the committee.  We will answer any questions following completion of my opening statement.  If we do not have the answers immediately to hand, we will endeavour to secure a response in a timely manner.<br\/><br\/>I am delighted to have been appointed as CEO of KBC Bank Ireland.  This country is vibrant, outward looking and ambitious for its people and places a premium on innovation, which is an exciting prospect for a bank like ours. <br\/><br\/>While I am new to Ireland and arrived at a good time, into a thriving economy and society, that does not mean I am unaware of events in Ireland&rsquo;s recent banking past.  I see it as essential to my mandate to show our customers that we have absorbed the lessons necessary for embedding positive change, ensuring that their needs stand at the centre of KBC&rsquo;s way of doing business. <br\/><br\/>The process of change has already begun in KBC, with a comprehensive transformation plan being put into place step by step.  This plan will be underpinned by the values we hold throughout KBC Group, for which we use the acronym &quot;PEARL&quot;, which stands for performance, empowerment, accountability, responsiveness and local embeddedness.  This means that in KBC, we embrace the diversity of our teams and customers in all our local markets.  I recently had the pleasure of meeting the chairman of the Irish Banking Culture Board, the retired judge Mr. Justice John Hedigan, with whom I was extremely impressed.  I am pleased to share with members that my colleague, Ms Dara Deering, will be representing KBC on that recently established board. <br\/><br\/>My experience has taught me that for cultural change to be credible and sustainable, it takes time, hard work and one must have a clear horizon to move towards.  It starts at the top but must ultimately engage every last member of our staff.  It also requires that all financial institutions work together towards that horizon with the common goal of rebuilding trust in the sector.  It is my intention that KBC Bank Ireland fully embraces Irish society&rsquo;s call for change.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>KBC represents choice in Irish banking.  We are committed to making banking as easy as possible for Irish people.  Customer needs are changing rapidly.  We understand this, which is why we are combining customer service with unrivalled digital capabilities to deliver an unique, innovative and transparent banking experience.  We provide the kind of ease and convenience for which people are looking, so they can get on with living their lives. <br\/><br\/>We are building a model of banking of the future with customer ease at the heart of it.  The recent launch of KBC multi-banking, means that customers of KBC can now check the balance of current accounts held with other Irish banks through their mobile app.  We are the only bank to have opened our banking app to third parties through the digital walls of external providers.  We were the first to the market with the recently launched two socially responsible investment funds, SRI.  These funds are designed to balance environmental and social good and offer more investment opportunities to socially conscious consumers in Ireland.  For customers seeking person-to-person interaction, our KBC hubs have longer, more customer friendly opening hours, and our contact centre is available 24-7, 365 days in the year.  We are stepping up to extend this innovative approach with a KBC business banking service specifically designed for micro-SMEs in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>Our recently-published first quarter results tell a positive story about the choice we offer in the market.  More than 18,000 new customer accounts were added in the first three months of the year, bringing total customer numbers to just under 300,000.  We disbursed some &euro;216 million in new mortgage lending, which represented an increase of 9% year on year.  The digital mobile activity on our apps increased by 50% year on year.  The model works.  Overall KBC Bank Ireland reported a net profit of &euro;15 million after tax and impairments for the first quarter of this year<b>.<\/b><\/p><p>These results show that customers are seeking that alternative choice in the market.  The remaining non-performing loans at KBC Bank Ireland now concern primary dwelling homes.  Our approach here remains as it has been for some time to reduce these non-performing loans in an organic way.  In this, communication is key and every effort is made to establish and keep open communication channels with every individual customer who is experiencing difficulties meeting his or her repayments.<\/p><p> In my first few weeks of arriving here, I visited our arrears solutions unit - which is headed by Mr. Mahon - to gain a clear understanding of what is happening on the front line.  We have a special team that looks after the most sensitive cases and I sat down with them to look through some of the cases currently at hand.  When it comes to the issue of non-performing loans and arrears, I believe that we should continue to tread carefully.  In every case there is a person and a person's home.  We must remain conscious of the vulnerability of those who find themselves in difficulty, and behave accordingly.<\/p><p> All arrears cases that are related to a borrower&rsquo;s principal dwelling house are afforded the benefit of the mortgage arrears resolution process as set out under the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The success of these mortgage arrears solutions at KBC is evident in the number of arrears cases where resolution options have been implemented.  In some 90% of its arrears cases, borrowers have agreed a resolution option with KBC over the years.<\/p><p> Resolution options remain available at any time to the constructively engaging borrower, regardless of a borrower&rsquo;s history, and at all stages of the legal process.  The loss of a home is a significant trauma in someone&rsquo;s life.  That is why we insist on repossession being an action of last resort, coming at the end of an extensive process designed to identify a solution that keeps the occupant in their home.<\/p><p> The tracker mortgage examination has been a top priority for KBC and we are determined to right the wrongs experienced by our customers.  We do not anticipate material changes to the number of cases for redress beyond the figures that we published at the end of the first quarter.<\/p><p> We would like to again acknowledge our errors in relation to the administration of tracker mortgages and as newly-appointed chief executive officer, CEO, I add my sincerest apologies to those of my predecessors to those affected.  I also publicly commit us to taking on board the lessons learned on behalf of our customers.<\/p><p> The Irish economy has begun 2019 in good stead, with domestic economic activity underpinned by strong increases in employment and an improvement in household spending power.  While an emerging weakening of global economic growth will restrain Irish activity, the UK and US economies have performed better than expected of late and this has supported Irish export growth.  A young, well-educated and growing population, allied to encouraging trends in the public finances, an ambitious infrastructure programme and significant foreign direct investment suggest scope for the Irish economy to remain on a healthy path in coming years.<\/p><p> With regard to Brexit, we can only take note of the ambiguity around the whole process.  To this point, we have seen no material effect on KBC activity or our customers' relationship with us.  The nature and scale of the long-term impact of Brexit on Ireland will depend on a range of factors.  We remain watchful but whatever happens, I believe KBC Ireland is as ready at it can be.<\/p><p> In summary, KBC Bank Ireland represents choice in banking in Ireland.  It is my mandate to stay in tune with changing customer needs and to innovate for more convenience and transparency, thereby continuing to grow our customer base.  At the same time we are very aware of the need to stay in tune with demand for change in Irish society.  That is also part of my mission.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Roebben.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#G00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Roebben to his first meeting at this committee.  I am sure it will not be the last meeting that he will have here.  Mr. Roebben's colleagues, Ms Dara Deering, Mr. Barry D'Arcy and Mr. Brendan Mahon are very welcome.  Some the witnesses may be familiar with this meeting format from previously and perhaps they have looked at transcripts and recordings of earlier meetings.  The opening statement was relatively upbeat and the witness is fairly positive about the economy.  I am struck by the positivity in Mr. Roebben's statement compared with that of his predecessor who, if I am right, indicated that we are closer to the next recession than we are to the last one.  That line has stuck with me ever since he made that point.  While Ireland is relatively fortunate with corporation tax receipts, low interest rates on our national debt and so on, there are many uncertainties including Brexit, as outlined by the witness.<\/p><p>Since our last meeting with KBC I have heard anecdotally from people around the country that lending has almost stopped and people are very wary of taking on debt, which is possibly not a bad thing in some ways, but there is much less take-up.  Many people are worried about Brexit, the US-China trade wars, stock market decline and various other matters.  What are Mr. Roebben's thoughts on where the economy is going?  Could he outline to us the nature of the lending KBC is engaging in and whether it is less than anticipated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#G00300","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I would agree that we are closer to the next downturn than the last one.  I was analysing that in my previous job as head of credit risk globally for the KBC group.  Our chief economist, who keeps a close eye on things here, is still quite upbeat about the immediate expectations in the Irish economy.  We still expect 3.5% GDP growth, which is slightly more conservative than the IMF forecast of 4.7%.  The outlook is still positive.  We consider it from the retail client perspective.  Our mortgage distribution is up 9% year on year.  The year started a bit more slowly than we expected.  At the end of last year and in the first month of this year activity was less but we saw it pick up in February and March, which for the time being is continuing.  On the retail side, what probably happened was the scare around Brexit at that time, which kept some consumers back from taking the step but that seems to have recovered.  It is true that house prices are a concern.  Affordability is a real issue for many potential borrowers.  That has to do of course with the imbalance between offer and demand in terms of new housing coming to the market although our expectations are that 22,000 new dwellings will come onto the market this year at the present rhythm, compared with 18,000 units last year.  Our estimates, however, are that approximately 35,000 units per year would correspond to normal demand and would offer balance in this market, so we are still somewhere behind where we should be.  In that sense, we remain relatively optimistic.<\/p> <p>  There are many uncertainties there.  I am hardly an expert on Ireland after seven weeks so I will be humble about that but Brexit is a big sword of Damocles over expectations for growth but it can go in any direction.  The recent announcement of the European Central Bank, ECB, to keep lower interest rates going for a much longer term is the fuel for continuous growth.  I have summed up several elements that I think plead in favour of the short-term economic outlook for Ireland.  I am ill placed to answer how that potentially affects lending or investment demand in companies because it is not a market in which we are very active.  I can give macroeconomic figures but not a real personal feeling from our bank's point of view. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>KBC as a brand here in Ireland is relatively new but I think most of us are cognisant that IIB was a predecessor bank, which had a very long presence in Ireland albeit not at the retail level that KBC is engaging with now.

It is not that we will move to a future where there is no personal engagement but we see the branch, as the Senator calls it, or the hub, as we like to call it, as a place where a person can have a personal interaction with another person on the bank's side as a support channel.  Today that is very mixed.  There is still a group of customers that would prefer to go to the hub and speak with someone there first and then move to make transactions on a digital channel.  More and more, and we see this in other markets, the group of customers that wants to engage digitally, even to onboard digitally and will only ask for personal support be that physical support, through a contact centre or an electronic interface application - I will not mention brand names - is growing, such that last year in our traditional home market of Belgium, 56% of clients did not go to a branch.<\/p><p>A full year passed without them having to go to branches.  When we were making projections two years ago about this strength, we totally underestimated it.  I am too recent in the Irish market to put that into context here.  Ms Deering may be able to provide more background because she is more versed in that regard.  It is a trend that is happening across our markets.  In terms of our experience in other places, the take-up of digital starts slow, grows gradually and then takes off very fast.  Once the model has reached a particular phase and people start taking it up, with word of mouth it grows faster.  There will always be need for a place where the customer can interact personally with an adviser, more and more the interactions will generally be done digitally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>To put those numbers in an Irish context, nine out of ten of our customers do not go to physical hubs.

As Mr. Roebben stated, it is important to remember that the customer must have choice.  Different customer segments may want face-to-face contact, particularly where investment or a major decision is involved.  The reality, as evidenced in other markets, is that face-to-face contact may not be the traditional physical face-to-face any more, it may be video or some other mechanisms as well.

What I was interested to discover - I think it is quite unique - was that we had written as a legal obligation under the code of conduct.  We have already written to all of these customers twice to inform them, given the situation they are in and the loan-to-value they are at, that they might qualify for a lower rate.  The rates are then published.  They receive an individualised communication.  It was done at the end of last year and again in March this year.  Of that group, we saw approximately 5,000 customers who made a switch.  Others have not, but the number is increasing.  Writing to customers has had an effect compared to last year when the group was 4,000 or 5,000 larger.  It varies, depending on individual cases.  The Senator quoted an average figure.  Among the group of clients on standard variable rates, the average mortgage is much lower than our total average mortgage.  It is approximately &euro;79,000; therefore, it is much lower.  It depends on whether it is sufficiently interesting for the client, but there is always a saving.  However, it is for the client to judge whether he or she wants to go through the process.  The only condition is that a client obtain an official valuation of the property; therefore, the value of the property is officially documented.  Otherwise, the process is very smooth.  When clients receive such a communication which we intend to send once a year, the group that will make the switch will increase in size.

They have families, perhaps older parents or young children, are in busy workplaces and so on.  When I was going to college, there was significant pressure from whichever bank happened to be located on campus.  It wanted to recruit everyone.  As a certain bank manager said to me a long time ago, a person was more likely to change her husband or his wife than her or or his bank account.  That level of inertia stemmed from it being too much trouble to change a bank account, similar to a mortgage.  On average, the figure is about &euro;1,400, but it could be &euro;4,500 or &euro;5,000 for some of the people concerned because the loan is almost but not at 90% and the value might be much more than &euro;80,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#K01100","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>When we have brought all the various banks before the committee - and KBC is the last of the banks in this cycle - two of the main points have been Brexit, which I think we have touched on a bit, and the banking culture board.

Yes, I am aware of the Irish division.  I do not think this is unique to Ireland.  What happened in Ireland of course went much further and much deeper than what happened in other countries in Europe and where KBC is active.  What happened here was therefore very much on the group's radar and we discussed it.  To give the Senator some context, we held last year a two-day session with the entire top 300 of management in KBC Group to discuss the issue of culture and the topic of responsible behaviour and how to bring it into the group's work.  The special experience of what happened here in Ireland was on the agenda very explicitly as an example of things that should not be allowed to happen and can never happen again.<\/p> <p>  Let us talk about KBC Bank Ireland and KBC Group.  Regarding risk management, oversight and governance internally, there has been a sea change between what happens now in our institution and what would have happened ten or 12 years ago.  Structurally, a whole lot of measures have been taken to ensure better and more independent control.  There is a totally independent CRO, three lines of defence and so forth.  This is obvious now but that was not the case looking back ten or 15 years ago, when I could go through a whole technical list of governance issues.  There is also a totally different regulatory environment now with a lot of interventions that provide some needed checks and balances on the banking market.  The third component is the more difficult but also the more fundamental one: how one gets well-balanced behaviour in organisations.  This is about making sure that the output-versus-outcome trade-off is constantly being made.  On the one hand we must carry out cost-benefit analyses in generating return on economic capital but, on the other, we must be aware that every decision has an impact on clients.  Basically, the question is whether a decision enhances the well-being of the client.  Is there a fair balance in how costs and benefits are shared between the bank and the customer?  Ultimately, are the decisions we make scalable?  Something that might be a good idea in the short term could turn out to be a very bad one in the long term.  Something that might work very well for a particular type of customer could backfire badly if one were to start expanding it across the market.  The trick is to find a way to have that dialogue going on constantly at every level in the organisation.  This is a journey that has only just begun.  If one could fit this into a big rule book and go to page 25 and find the answer to a given question, it might be easy.  The reality is that life is very complex and opinions can differ as to what the right balance is.  At the core, this is about getting a dialogue going in an organisation and keeping it going at all levels, not only top down and bottom up, but also horizontally, peer to peer, and creating internally a culture of transparency whereby these doubts can be put on the table such that people can ask, \"Should we do this?  Should we make this decision on this product?\"  I could give examples from elsewhere in the group where one must carry out this management of dilemmas, because that is what it is.  It is part of the normal way of doing business.  Some things are very simple; we know we do not have to do them.  We of course do not do things that are forbidden by law.  Day to day, however, all of us are involved in decisions that incrementally can lead us on a wrong path.  The Senator asked me where we are.  We are at the beginning of the journey, and it will never stop.  It is a continuous journey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I appreciate the level of honesty and the depth of Mr. Roebben's response.

To be fair, the KBC representatives have acknowledged this.  There is always a dilemma between trying to make money while acknowledging that the company is in a relationship with the customer which is very important.

KBC is facilitating vulture funds by the sell-off of these non-performing loans, or what it calls non-performing loans as in some cases they are split mortgages.  I dispute the definition of non-performing loans.  The fund is already making &euro;100,000 out of it and it wants a further &euro;20,000.  There is unfairness built into this.

We will see where that leads.<\/p> <p>  Given that the mortgage and housing markets are central to the bank's business model, do our guests have any observations on the housing market?  There are limited opportunities for first-time buyers to purchase properties.  Supply is increasing but when we strip out the houses that are, quite rightly, being built as social homes by local authorities and approved housing bodies, the entire developments being bought by REITs or investment funds, and one-off houses in rural areas being built by qualifying planning applicants, the number of properties actually available is quite small.  I am sure the bank would like it to be more given that it is a key part of its business.  There is also an affordability crisis.  Supply is very tight but the cost of building in Ireland has risen significantly in recent times.  It is not as simple as diagnosing it as a supply problem.  There is also an affordability problem.  Not all new developments are selling very quickly because the homes are expensive and we have the macro-prudential rules.  What are the observations of our guests on the market and where do they see it going?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#U01300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>After only several weeks in Ireland, it would be presumptuous of me to claim to be an expert and answer comprehensively this very complex question.  What we do observe is that it is very clear that, at the core, there is an imbalance between offer and demand.  This is undeniable.  Our economists estimate that where the market is today it should absorb 35,000 newly built units per year and we are on the path to add 22,000 this year.  Last year, the figure was approximately 18,000.  We have an imbalance and this has been going on for some time.  It is building up and the economy is doing very well.  Unemployment is at an extremely low rate.  We have this tension that leads, particularly in certain areas, including Dublin, which is very important for our business model, to prices that pose an affordability problem.  This is a clear fact.<\/p><p>On the prudential rules, quite honestly, I believe it is good that the Central Bank of Ireland puts limitations into the market.  One of the big lessons that came out of the previous crisis - in the Irish market and in all the other countries where we have a presence - is that we see the central banks intervening in the definitions of the rules, the level of which depend on the local circumstances.  This is a good evolution because mortgage markets left on their own, particularly if the underlying real estate markets are unbalanced, will become unhinged.

Before I arrived in Ireland I personally looked at how we approach non-performing loans because I am aware of how sensitive and important the issue is in Ireland and for KBC Bank Ireland.  Our policy has been, and remains, to really look for every possible option to individually engage with every customer.  This affects people and their houses so it is always a difficult situation.  If one looks back over the period since 2009 - we went back that far - some 90% of the people going into payment difficulties arrears have ended up with a restructuring solution.  I gave the statistics earlier.  There are 55,500 live private dwelling mortgage cases, of which 85% are paying normally and working very hard to pay every month.  Of the live cases, 10% - or 5,500 people - are performing under some form of restructuring solution with the mortgage arrears restructuring process, MARP.  We also have some 3,300 customers, which is really the most difficult part, that go 90 days arrears or more.  We are still able to engage with half of this group to find solutions.  There is, however, no contact or engagement with the remaining group.  We cannot reach those clients and so cannot talk with them.  This is the difficult part.  As long as communication is going on and there is dialogue then we will find some sort of arrears solution.  It is in everybody's interest and certainly in the bank's interest.  It is very thorough.  The legal process is the very last place we will go.  If nothing else happens the independent courts and the legal system are the only way to find some kind of closure, but only after a very long process over many years.  Even if one goes through the legal process it too is a lengthy process and at any time in the process if the customer is willing to engage we are open to go out of that process again and find a common solution.  With this very thorough process we have learned a lot over the years.  The options available have expanded.  When one considers the people who are on the arrears solutions, gradually one sees an increasing number moving out and improving.  They have come through the difficult situation.  There is, however, a cohort of people who are in a very difficult situation.  If no dialogue is going on then it is very difficult to advance.  I believe the KBC process is extremely thorough and the attention we pay to it in Ireland has impressed me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#W01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I would not expect Mr. Roebben to know all about the eviction that took place in Strokestown in Roscommon, which happened down the road from me but would he accept that KBC nationally has lost face over the way that was handled?<\/p><p>As the Deputy noted, I cannot comment on specific cases, particularly when legal proceedings are ongoing.
