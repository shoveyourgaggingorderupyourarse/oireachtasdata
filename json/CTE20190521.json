I am joined by Mr. Peadar O&rsquo;Scanaill, president of the council.   <\/p> <p>  On behalf of the Veterinary Council of Ireland, I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine the important issue of the corporate ownership of veterinary practices.  I thank the committee for its invitation.  I will say a few words about the role of the council, as it is very relevant in the context of this discussion.<\/p> <p>  The Veterinary Council of Ireland is the statutory body responsible for the regulation and management of the veterinary professions, they being veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses.  The council was set up under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, as amended, and is under the aegis of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Its principal function is to regulate the practise of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the Republic of Ireland in the interests of animal health and welfare and veterinary public health.<\/p><p>The functions of the Veterinary Council of Ireland include protection of the public through the supervision of veterinary education, the maintenance of the register of veterinary practitioners and nurses, the registration of veterinary premises, and through disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council of Ireland ensures that all registered persons meet the necessary standards in terms of education, skill, competence and professional conduct to perform their duties, in accordance with the prescribed codes of professional conduct and ethics and in accordance with legislative requirements.  Any practitioner must be registered with the Veterinary Council of Ireland to practise as a veterinary practitioner or a veterinary nurse.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland safeguards access and maintenance of the register, with 2,842 veterinary practitioners and 935 veterinary nurses currently registered.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council of Ireland sets standards for all undergraduate education programmes and works to ensure veterinary education and training remain up to date and are benchmarked to the highest international standards.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland also requires that all veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses fulfil ongoing professional education requirements to ensure they keep their knowledge and skills up to date throughout their professional lives.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland provides guidance to veterinary registrants on matters relating to conduct and ethics through their code of professional conduct.  The code of professional conduct consists of the rules and principles which govern veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses, in the exercise of their profession.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council of Ireland is also the designated body to which members of the public may make a complaint against a veterinary practitioner or a veterinary nurse.  One of the functions of the council is to take disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct.  In 2018, the Veterinary Council of Ireland held five fitness to practise inquiries, following consideration of 21 complaints.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, the topic of corporate ownership of veterinary practices is a very divisive one and has been the subject of much debate in recent times.  Since January 2018, there has been significant ongoing work in the Veterinary Council of Ireland to progress consideration of the regulation of the practice in regard to corporate ownership.  This is a very divisive and challenging matter for the profession.  Nevertheless, the Veterinary Council of Ireland must continue to ensure the highest standards of veterinary medicine in the regulation and management of the professions.<\/p><p> Historically, section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005, was interpreted to prevent a body corporate from owning a veterinary practice, and this understanding was reflected in the code of professional conduct published by the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  However, legal advice received by the Veterinary Council of Ireland advised that the legislation does not speak to the ownership of practices, and thus the council has no legal authority in determining the ownership of practices.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland has no legal powers over the regulation of the market in relation to corporate ownership of veterinary practices.  The parameters of our powers as established under the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005 simply do not extend to this area.  In light of this, in December 2017, the Veterinary Council of Ireland amended the code of professional conduct to explicitly state that corporate ownership of veterinary practices was not prohibited.  Following reaction from the veterinary professions and farming bodies citing a lack of consultation on the matter of corporate ownership, the Veterinary Council of Ireland, at a meeting in January 2018, decided to put the proposed amended section of the code of professional conduct on hold and carry out an extensive consultation process of stakeholders on the subject of ownership of veterinary practices.  Consultations conducted to date include the following: a survey of the general public conducted by market research company Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes; a consultation process whereby any interested parties could submit their views; a survey of the veterinary professions conducted by market research company Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes; research and analysis on other veterinary regulators internationally and; research and analysis on other regulated professions in Ireland.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council of Ireland has also benefited from legal advice on the matter, and all these inputs, together with the results of a consultation process and survey of the public, are to be consolidated into a report by Grant Thornton.  It is hoped this report will be available shortly for consideration by the Veterinary Council of Ireland.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council of Ireland is the statutory body responsible for the regulation and management of the veterinary professions.  It is worth noting that as an independent regulator to the veterinary professions, there is no express legislative role for the Veterinary Council of Ireland to determine the ownership of veterinary practices.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland is also about to embark on the development of a new corporate strategy for the five year period of 2019 to 2023.  The council will look to work with partner bodies to shape the professional lives of veterinary registrants to ensure that the development and oversight of the veterinary professions continue to foster best professional practice in the best interests of animal welfare and the public interest.  We will continue to work to ensure that the high standards expected in the veterinary industry are upheld, and that quality of veterinary care is continuously improving into the future.  I would like to thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address them today.  Both the president of the Veterinary Council of Ireland Council, Mr. &Oacute; Scanaill and I, are happy to address any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Muldoon.

To put a little bit of context to this, we have received correspondence and some lobbying from various organisations and individuals on the issue of corporate ownership.  People fear that it will become similar to the situation with Boots pharmacies or a fast food type of situation where a whole lot of veterinary practices around the country will be owned by a company which would primarily be interested in profit and would probably concentrate on the aspects of veterinary practice which are most profitable and leave the others.  From the committee's perspective in looking after the interests of farmers and the primary producer, we are talking about the larger animals such as when a cow is calving or a sheep is out at night that needs assistance and a vet cannot be got.  In many areas of rural Ireland there is already a problem with that and if we went down the route that is feared with the corporate ownership creeping into the situation, there would be great fears for many people in the farming community that this would happen.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a few questions on that.  Ms Muldoon outlined in her opening statement that one of the Veterinary Council of Ireland's key responsibilities is to ensure that duties are performed in accordance with prescribed codes of professional conduct and ethics.  In the context of vets who are employees of a company which is not the vet, I would like to get detail on how the council expects to be able to make sure that happens, to make sure the control is there and how the council would find that.<\/p> <p>  In referring to the background, Ms Muldoon said that \"Historically, section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005, was interpreted to prevent a body corporate from owning a veterinary practice,\" but that legal advice told the council otherwise.  When was that and at what stage was that advice received?  Later on Ms Muldoon stated that the council went into a consultation process and said the Veterinary Council of Ireland has benefitted from legal advice on the matter.  I assume that is separate legal advice since then.  Can we get the details of that legal advice?  What is the situation with that?<\/p> <p>  On the practices that have already been bought out by companies, and I understand that some companies from Britain have come here and bought practices, how many of them have they bought?  Is that vision of chains of practices starting to develop?  Are they focusing on a particular type of practice?  My understanding is they are focusing on the small animals and equine practices and that they are not as interested in the other practices that would be more general for the farming community out there.  The fear that people have is that if that will be the focus and if a veterinary practice or partnership sells off a portion of its practice to a company, it is selling off the portion that is most profitable and the other part of it that is not so profitable will end up going into decline.  Therefore, we will see a situation where the farming community, which needs a service, which deserves a service and for which the Veterinary Council of Ireland is responsible for ensuring that a service is provided, will see that slip.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of partnerships versus limited companies, my understanding is that many veterinary practices became limited companies years ago.  For the last 20 years many of them have been limited companies.  There is nothing wrong with that and that has gone on, and yet the Veterinary Council of Ireland is saying that section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005 prevented it from happening or was interpreted in a way that prevented it from happening.  I do not get that.  If, until recently, the Veterinary Council of Ireland thought there could not be companies then why were there companies?  That is a simple question.<\/p> <p>  Nobody has a problem with a vet or a number of vets setting up a limited company.<\/p><p>The issue is that if a group of investors came together, set up a company, decided to buy a couple of veterinary practices and expand the company further, they will not have any skin in the game in that they will have no concern for anything other than profit.  That is a matter of concern.<\/p><p> An associated matter that concerns me, although it is slightly different, is that people have told me it is difficult to find vets who are interested in working with the farming community.  One of the big issues is that many of the vets who qualify are interested only in small-animal practice rather than the tougher and less profitable aspects.  What can be done to ensure that vets will work with the farming community?<\/p><p> I turn to the number of vets qualifying in Ireland.  I have teenage children who attend college.  Through them and their friends, I hear what is going on.  One chap who lives not far from me had his heart set on being a vet but he was 25 points short on his leaving certificate and there was no hope.  His family was not wealthy enough to send him to Budapest to train.  That problem needs to be addressed.  In many other countries, people studying other disciplines can progress to train in veterinary college and, while there may be an element of that in Ireland, there is limited scope for it to happen.  Could access be made more open?  Many people who take courses in agricultural colleges have a keen interest in veterinary medicine and would probably make excellent vets, not least because they come from an agricultural background.  They find veterinary medicine is closed off to them, however, because of the current system.  Will our guests comment on that?<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council pointed out that a change had been made to the code of professional conduct.  Did some members of the board have a conflict of interest, or were such conflicts ever declared, given that they were in the process of selling their practices to bodies corporate while they were working on the code?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#D00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Muldoon for her opening statement.  The major problem is the shortage of large-animal vets in rural and, in particular, peripheral areas.  What is the Veterinary Council doing to address that in the immediate, medium and long terms?  That a veterinary practice is a legal entity is not an issue for us.  Rather, it is about the availability of vets and what the Veterinary Council is doing in respect of education.  How much communication does the Veterinary Council have with University College Dublin and the other education providers to ensure that a sufficient number of large-animal vets are available?<\/p> <p>  How many vets are needed, given the number of large animals in the State?  Are they mapped geographically to ensure a proper geographical spread?  What is the Veterinary Council doing about qualifications, the number of leaving certificate points required and the pathways to qualification?  Is the Veterinary Council aware that SUSI grant aid is allotted to vets who train abroad but in their final undergraduate year or while studying for their master's degree, they cannot secure funding?  Why are so many large-animal vets leaving practices?  I wish to learn what the Veterinary Council is doing to address these issues because we are going down a route similar to that relating to a lack of priests in some areas.  We need to take tangible steps.  Some might say vets are much more important than priests but I will not get into that argument.  Nevertheless, we need to address the matter.  Farmers in places such as that from which I come from in Belmullet and elsewhere in County Mayo need certainty.  Due to the additional requirements for herds that are now made and so on, they need to know that an affordable vet will be available to meet their needs in order that they can continue farming in the way they need to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#E00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for appearing before the committee.

While we have concerns about rural areas and the future provision of services at large-animal practices in rural Ireland, the principal point we wish to discuss is the corporate ownership of practices.  One matter is whether this is good for the industry but another is whether it is legal.  I found part of the presentation to be contradictory.  Ms Muldoon stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Veterinary Council of Ireland has no legal powers over the regulation of the market in relation to corporate ownership of veterinary practices.  The parameters of our powers, as established under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, simply do not extend to this area. <\/blockquote> <p>That is a clear and concise statement and it was made on the basis of legal advice.  Ms Muldoon went on to state, however, that the following month the Veterinary Council decided to suspend the decision it had made in December because of the views of various stakeholders.  She listed five points of research the Veterinary Council would carry out in respect of the decision it made in December.  However, she clearly outlined that the decision made in December was clear-cut and that the legal advice indicated there was no ambiguity involved.  A month later, following reaction from vets and farming bodies, the Veterinary Council suspended the decision it made in December, even though Ms Muldoon stated that its legal advice was clear.  I find that contradictory.  We are in a state of flux whereby a review to determine the correct action to take is being conducted and whereby Grant Thornton will publish a report.  However, practices continue to be purchased by bodies corporate while the review is ongoing.  I would have expected a handbrake to be applied in respect of all sales while the review is ongoing.  It seems that somewhere between December and January a lack of confidence in the legal advice to the Veterinary Council emerged, particularly in view of the fact that after receiving legal advice and making a decision, the council began a consultation process.<\/p><p> The train of events does not make sense.  The consultation process should have taken place before a decision was made by the Veterinary Council to allow corporates to purchase practices.  Deputy Martin Kenny has already asked if there was a conflict of interest in the making of the decision by the council.  The purchase of one well-known practice has attracted much media attention, with many questions asked as to whether there was a conflict of interest.  I would like the sequence of events involved to be explained.  One paragraph of the presentation is unambiguous but the following several paragraphs contradict it.  The Veterinary Council going into a consultation process has put question marks over the legal advice it received.  It took a serious decision on that legal advice in December 2017 and then sat back from it in January 2018.<\/p><p> The Veterinary Council deals with disciplinary action in the case of professional misconduct.  How does this work if a veterinary practice facing such action is not owned by a vet?  How do the powers of the council sit with taking disciplinary action when the ownership of a practice rests outside the profession?<\/p><p> I am not happy with the sequence of events here.  Something does not sit right with me.  I would like to see a copy of the legal advice.  One can ask two good barristers the same question but get two different legal advices.  I cannot see that practices acquired by corporate entities are providing better services.  I have serious concerns about this matter.  It also raises questions about the disciplinary role played by the Veterinary Council.  This all hinges on the interpretation of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  To enter consultations after making a decision means that the council is not confident regarding the decision it took in December 2017.  At the very least, sales of practices should be halted until the position is clarified once and for all.  I am baffled by the sequence of events, particularly in the context of a report being sought from Grant Thornton after the initial decision had been made.  Will the council provide an explanation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#E00400","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I have looked carefully at section 13 of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  It states that the principal function of the Veterinary Council is to regulate and promote the practice of veterinary medicine in the interests of the public.  Section 26 deals with disclosures of interest by members of the council or any committee attached to it.  One understands that changes to the Act may well be warranted over time and that nothing stands still.  Change should only take place, if at all, after proper, full and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders.<\/p><p>Some of the matters that have been outlined to the committee are unbelievable.  The council referred to making changes.  The peculiar thing is that the council stalled the process after making the change instead of carrying out the consultation prior to that change.  That does not make sense.  It is an enormous matter for a reputable body.<\/p><p>I am concerned about what some of my colleagues have stated regarding large-farm and large-animal practices.  I come from a small village where we are lucky with our vet, Charlie Murtagh, who has been there for the past 40 years.  When he retires, what should we do?  The profession has become elitist too.  It was elitist in 1974 when I was young agricultural science student.  I always enjoyed playing for the &quot;ags&quot; against the vets because it was good tough stuff with good rural people, one against the other and no whingeing.  One had to have 40 points more to study veterinary medicine than was the case for agricultural science.  In fact, agricultural science is a far wider discipline of which I am proud and which allowed me to go into other areas.  The best young people would make great vets if it were not for this issue of leaving certificate points.  A person might have 600 leaving certificate points but might know nothing of animals.  The person with 250 points, however, could be great with animals.  He or she might be able to detect redwater disease from looking at a cattle herd from a half a mile away.  While this may not be the council&rsquo;s concern, it should follow up on it because it wants to get the best people into veterinary practices.<\/p><p>Section 54(2)(<i>a<\/i>),(<i>b<\/i>) and (<i>c<\/i>) of the 2005 Act specifically prohibit corporate bodies from practising veterinary medicine or surgery.  A body corporate can employ or engage a registered vet but he or she has to be bound by the code of ethics of the council.  What the council did in December 2017 represented a significant departure.  It was embarked on unilaterally by the council, with little or no input from anybody including the Oireachtas, the job of which it is to deal with legislative amendments.  The council interpreted the primary Act.  Whoever advised the council originally did so correctly.  The council, however, does not have uninhibited powers to do what it likes and disregard the legislative framework.  In one fell swoop, the council introduced a system of deregulation that is expressly prohibited under the provisions in the legislation.<\/p><p>Ms Muldoon is a solicitor and knows this better than I do but she was not there in fairness.  The term &quot;shall&quot; means that something is mandatory while the term &quot;may&quot; indicates that it is discretionary.  The term &quot;shall&quot; does not brook any other interpretation.  We were sending signals about this but the council had no interest.  The council sought advice from the Minister but it did not wait.  For some reason, the council was impatient.  We have to find out why that impatience grew into an unusual unilateral decision which effectively deregulated the system.  I was taken aback by the fact the council made a decision in December 2017 and then a few weeks later in January, after eating Christmas dinner, it decided it was unsafe.  Deputy Cahill is correct.  Something was triggered and somebody shouted &quot;Stall the Horse&quot; at a point when it was already galloping away from the stable.<\/p><p>We have been rooting around in respect of this matter and there were many concerns expressed at the council's meetings in March 2017.  I am sure that, like other organisations, the Veterinary Council has a legislation and ethics committee in place.  I am a barrister and there is such a committee in place in my profession.  There were lots of concerns expressed before a decision was made.  How did those concerns, which were wiped away like the snows of winter, re-emerge following the decision?  After January 2018, having decided to consult everybody, which is a very good thing, the matter was going to be distilled in a Grant Thornton report to come out whenever the sun rose again.  However, that did not stop a body corporate getting involved in June or July 2018, six or seven months afterwards.  If the Veterinary Council had second thoughts in January 2018, why was any corporation allowed to proceed to purchase a practice six  months later?  That does not make sense.  I would like to have a body like that whereby I could give an opinion one day and write an opposing opinion for a different crowd the next.  That is the analogy.  I am absolutely flummoxed by this.  I am probably a bit dull.  The question has to be asked as to why this review and extensive consultation with stakeholders on the subject of veterinary practices did not take place and inform the process?  Why, while this was being done, did the <i>status quo antebellum<\/i>not prevail?  Ms Muldoon will know the term.  It means the one before the decision, before any wars happened.  That should have prevailed and it should have been maintained pending the outcome of the review.<br\/><br\/>We have been on about this chairperson for the past 18 months or so.  The matter was raised in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>in December 2017.  I recall it very well because it happened at Christmas.  I come from a very rural area.  It is back in the sticks, as they say.  There would be no one around.  Do our guests believe that corporations or the like would worry about us living miles out from Mullingar or Athlone?  We would be lost.  In June 2018, the incorporated body purchased a veterinary practice and proceeded to own and operate it.  This brings us to the kernel of the matter.  Our guests will have to answer this question or we will be obliged to find out why they will not do so.  While the ownership of the veterinary practice was under review, which has been stated plainly earlier, why did the Veterinary Council allow non-vets to purchase, own and operate a veterinary practice?  Let us ask a basic question: do our guests believe that non-vets should be allowed to own and operate veterinary practices?<br\/><br\/>There was relating to Germany that was taken to Europe in 2009.  It was about pharmacies.  A parallel situation arose and because of the issues regarding the protection of health, welfare and everything else, that was outlawed.  It was argued that it went against the freedom of establishment, freedom of movement, etc.  However, the European Court of Justice found that a state can put in place particular rules that it can operate.  Deputy Cahill inquired about the legal advice the Veterinary Council received in 2017 which allowed it to change specific elements of the code of conduct.  Our guests have stated that council received that advice.  Having done so and implemented the change, why did the council then second guess the advice?  The action it took in January 2018 indicates that it doubted the change and had second thoughts about the advice.  I say to both of our guests in good faith that the council has no right to change anything until the Veterinary Practice Act is amended.  That is the way to proceed.  The Minister should be taking a hand in this.  I am not stating that our guests are not entitled to argue for changes in the Act.  Of course they are.  The Act is 14 or 15 years old.  I was here when it was passed and I know a small bit about it.  However, I am perplexed by they way the whole matter was turned upside down in the space of less than a month.<br\/><br\/>Ms Muldoon only came into her position in April.  I wish her well in it.  In fairness, she is trying to provide answers.  I am sure Mr. &Oacute; Scanaill was there before so he might answer for some of this.  If the Veterinary Council allows a corporation to own a veterinary practice, how does it regulate its operation?  That is important.  The original guideline included the words &quot;own&quot; and &quot;operate&quot;.  Then the recommendation was brought forward and it only contains the word &quot;own&quot;, which is significant.  The conjunctive was taken out of it and only the word &quot;own&quot; remains.  The council has left itself somewhat open to charges that it changed course in the space of three to four weeks at most.  That is unbelievable.  The council is entitled to change its mind.  Its members might go back to their committee and state that they had another thought about the legal advice or had obtained further advice.  They might go to some of the big boys to obtain their advice.  They might have decided to take advice from the likes of me and then stated, &quot;Jeekers.  No, we will get somebody who works in area of competition law&quot; or something of that nature.  That is grand.  However, at that stage the council should have stalled the process and reverted back to what its code of conduct stated at the time.  Then there would not be any question.<br\/><br\/>The Veterinary Council is still waiting for Grant Thornton to distil the various findings from the investigation.  The consultation process has been prolonged.  That is grand.  Our guests indicate that they are expecting it in June or July.  Perhaps they might give us an idea of when this consultation process will end and when we can expect the reviewed position on ownership and operation of veterinary practices to be issued.  I and my colleagues have raised a number of important questions and very salient points and I hope we get some answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#F00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of the questions and I will ask Mr. &Oacute; Scanaill to come in on some other matters.  In response to Deputy Martin Kenny, whom I thank for his questions, the Veterinary Council has no role in ownership.  It has never had a role in ownership and it will not have a role in ownership into the future.  It is a statutory body and it oversees the quality of the services delivered by its registries.  The Deputy referred to profit focus.<\/p><p>The Veterinary Council of Ireland will be very strong in its role in ensuring the integrity and quality of the provision of veterinary medicine and services will always remain of the highest standard.  <\/p><p> The Deputy queried the legal advice received.  As a body corporate, the Veterinary Council of Ireland received advice in 2017 and 2018.  It is very informed and engaged.  It is very aware of the importance and significance of the role it plays and takes no decisions lightly.<\/p><p> The Deputy is correct that there is one programme of undergraduate education in Ireland.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland accredits programmes of education, but it is not within its gift or control to initiate new programmes.  It is outside its control to increase the number of registrants.  I can say there is very good communication with UCD on the programme of education delivered.  All members will acknowledge the standard of graduates produced in Ireland in the field of veterinary medicine.  <\/p><p> The Deputy referred to the conflict of interest with board members.  I am happy to confirm that the Veterinary Council of Ireland takes all decisions as a body corporate.  No one member carries particular interests.  There is a mixed profile around the table and all members elected and appointed as public interest representatives wear public interest hats when sitting at the table.  <\/p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh talked about the geographical spread of veterinary surgeons and nurses and the pathways to qualifications.  I do not want to repeat myself, but there is one programme of education accredited by the Veterinary Council of Ireland and it is delivered by UCD.  As I said in my opening statement, the council is about to embark on the development of its corporate strategy.  Pathways to qualifications, the geographical spread of veterinary surgeons and nurses and all of the data available to the council may well be covered in the strategy for its role, influencing policy in the Department and otherwise in the future.  That is a matter to considered in the strategy, work on which has yet to commence.  Ultimately, the strategy will be determined by the council. <\/p><p> Deputy Corcoran-Kennedy asked whether the council would seek further powers to extend its remit.  It would be wrong for me to predict how the council will act.  The strategy will be developed later this year.  The council is precluded from acting in respect of ownership, but it will use all of the regulatory tools at its disposal to ensure continued high standards in the practise of veterinary medicine.  The consultation embarked on by the council in recent months has illuminated several aspects for the council to consider in its strategy and in the future.  Therefore, in that sense it has been very beneficial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I asked why legal advice had been sought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#H00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>It was sought on the basis that it was believed there were inconsistencies in the code of conduct.

They are pointed and relevant.  <\/p> <p>  To provide some background information, being a veterinarian is in my bones, on both sides of my family.  My dad was a vet, as were my uncles on my mum's and dad's sides.  I have cousins who are vets and a daughter who is studying veterinary medicine in Budapest.  That was mentioned and I will return to the point.  My area is large animal services.  Believe it or not, my grandmother and great grandmothers were dairy farmers on the main street of Swords.  Cows were milked in Swords and my brother Padraig continues to do so.  He has a substantial herd in the Swords area and appears on milk cartons.  There were 11 of us in the family, two of whom are vets.  Therefore, the profession is very important to us.  <\/p> <p>  Before I answer Deputy Martin Kenny's questions, this issue came up in the council for several years.  I am its president and proud to be.  This is my eighth year on the council.  A good while ago, three or four years ago, questions were being asked about who could or could not buy a practice and whether a corporate could be involved.  It was clear to us that a corporate could not be involved.  The question was always about ownership.  There were provisions in the code that were almost contradictory.  There is no doubt that there are vets who work for corporates.  How, therefore, could a corporate not own a practice?  The council had to study the Act.  Had we done this beforehand, we would have been far better for it.  By the time we got the reaction of stakeholders, we realised we needed to go much wider.  As the registrar said, there is no mention of ownership in the Act.  In fact, the practice, as an entity, is not mentioned.  What is clear is the description of the practise of veterinary medicine as anything to do with animal health and diseases, any advice thereon, any treatment, surgery and certification provided.  It goes on to mention the post mortem and rectal examination of mares.  Anything to do with animals is laid out in it.  It is very clear in section 54 who can or cannot do this for reward or otherwise.  If it concerns veterinary medicine, it is very much confined to veterinary practitioners only.  If it is related to veterinary nursing, it applies to veterinary nurses only.  That is our focus.  When we were being asked who could buy and sell a practice, if a practitioner was to retire but would continue to own the practice or if a spouse owned half of the practice, the council was never involved.  We were asked these questions and when we examined the code, we found inconsistencies and felt clarification was needed.<\/p> <p>  In response to the statement that there is no prohibition on ownership, it is the consequences of such a statement that are the problem.  As a stand-alone statement, a practice and its ownership are not mentioned in the Act.  These statements have knock-on effects and Deputy Penrose picked up on the point that it was the operation of the practice that mattered.  People were not really talking about ownership, although they were using the word \"own\".  They were actually trying to become operators.  The Act is clear in its description of a veterinary practice, who can and cannot practise for reward or otherwise for animal owners, an industry or an educational employer.  To answer the question about how to control such things, heretofore we were never interested in the ownership of a practice.  We were only interested in vets.  Our role will involve the regulation of the service provided for the public.  Ownership is a sideline issue.  It is a distraction and has been very divisive and distracting, but in the consultation we are absolutely and specifically following what the Act tells us, that only a veterinary practitioner can carry out what is described in section 53 as the act of veterinary medicine for a third party and animal owners for reward or otherwise.<\/p><p>That is what we are primarily speaking about here - the farming community, horse owners and animal owners in general.<\/p><p> I was asked when we got legal advice on section 54.  We got various legal advices, some dating back as far back as 2014.  In its legal advice, which goes back even further than that, the Competition Authority described the section as vague.  The legal advice that we were coming in with was that owners were not there.  As I said, the wording was introduced we would be the first to put our hands up and say that consultation would have been far better if that had come beforehand.  The consultation is now going ahead and everyone knows that this is definitely under review.<\/p><p> Who is buying and selling?  Practices have always been bought and sold.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland has no hand, act or part in any of that.  It has no remit in respect of who is buying or selling practices, which are usually passed down from generation to generation.  Very often, they are in the hands of others or there may be part owners or investors.  However, owners and investors do not influence in any way the decision of how many blood tests, services or X-rays are performed.  The clinical autonomy of service must at all times be in the hands of the vets and that is where we are heading with all of this.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1558393200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Deputy Jackie Cahill took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>As I said, we got various legal advices on section 54.  There is no doubt that the most recent advice reiterates the issue of ownership.  Who can buy and sell really is not our responsibility.  As to how many practices were bought at this time, because we have genuinely never known who owned a practice and the Act does not describe a practice, we do not have a handle on the matter.  We do not ask anyone who owns the practice.  The issue is who controls and runs a practice, an issue Deputy Penrose mentioned.  The important question is how come or why that suddenly disappeared and that is where our remit comes in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Does Mr. &Oacute; Scanaill not accept that ownership and control are important?

That is the issue.  For Mr. &Oacute; Scanaill to say he does not care who owns a practice seems to sidestep the issue.  The council has a responsibility.  Surely its responsibility is to make sure everything is done correctly and not simply say it does not care who owns a practice as along as everything is done correctly.  What about a practice requiring its vets to use only particular medicines?  We discussed earlier the issue of closed loops in the farming industry in terms of beef production.  If one has a similar situation in a veterinary practice, how well will that work in the long term?  To say one does not care who owns a practice is to slightly step outside where the council needs to be.

We may have to appear before the committee when we have concluded our considerations and we would love to have an opportunity to do so.  However, we have to work within the current Act.  We are adamant that the control of veterinary medicine is completely in the hands of the vet in respect of who carries out the practice of veterinary medicine and where it can be carried out.  A certificate must be supplied by the council to an applicant who must be a registrant and must be a vet.  The certificate is non-transferable and applies for four years only.  We can also add conditions and apply limitations to it.  As far as we are concerned, the regulation of a practice involves regulating the practitioners that provide the service to the public.  That is exactly our role and focus.  It is not the case that we do not care but the other aspect is a side issue.  If an owner wishes to influence the veterinary practitioners and the latter have any concerns about the matter, then it is to ourselves.  We have issued a certificate to that premises at and from which the service starts.  If there are concerns that the owner is doing anything because of the autonomy of service and the questions that the vets have in terms of how they tend to the animals or what drugs or surgeries they use, that is completely in the hands of the professionals working in it.  There is no contract and no one can enter into anything that lowers or diminishes that in any way.

Vets cannot assist somebody else to provide a service.  The only person who can perform veterinary medicine and provide that service are the vets working in a practice.  As I said, a practice is not described in the Act.  What is described is the certificate of suitability, which is given to a vet and a vet only if it is veterinary medicine he or she is giving.  That is the premises and the vets who are working in it are listed on the certificate of suitability.  That is the service to the farmer.  Vets cannot enter a contract that affects them in any way or diminishes their answerability to the Veterinary Council of Ireland, the code and the basic core principles of veterinary medicine.  It is not that we do not care.  We are acting with the registrants and the service they are providing at and from the premises for which we have given a certificate of suitability.

What I wanted to know from the council was what the catalyst was for starting the procedures that commenced at the beginning of 2018.  Why would the council in its role seek private legal advice when section 54(2) is law in my reading of the game, albeit I am not as well qualified or versed in the law as Deputy Penrose?  Why did the council not come to us?  We are the legislators in this land.  The Minister has the ultimate responsibility.  What was the catalyst for the council to turn a blind eye on the back of private personal legal advice when we have an Attorney General and agriculture committees of the Oireachtas, Deputies and Senators and Opposition parties who, as Deputy Penrose says, are only too willing to have a go at a Minister or Department if something is wrong or some flaw exists in legislation?

Just before Senators left, mention was made of how many points one needs to become a vet and how much money a family needs behind it even with the points.  Now one can win the lottery, not have a point to one's name and never even have done one's leaving certificate and buy a veterinary practice and employ veterinarians who, in my reading of the council's own report, the council will have no power or authority to regulate.  It will be the owner of the practice who is answerable to the council.  However, if he or she is not a practitioner, he or she is not really answerable to the council while his or her employees are answerable to the practice owner.  The council has nullified its own role and overstepped the mark by dealing with matters outside its remit.  By Mr. &Oacute; Scanaill's own admission, the council had to seek private legal advice as to the ownership.  That should have been hard-balled back to the Minister straight away or back to the committee.  We do legislative scrutiny here.  It is up to us to look at section 54(2).  That is our role, not the role of the council or of a private barrister or solicitor, whichever was employed.

That is why we had hardly attended another meeting when we put a line through it.<\/p> <p>  As I have said before and do not want to repeat too much regarding ownership in itself, it is about the operation of the practices.  Why was operation removed?  Operation was removed because the Veterinary Council of Ireland recognised that it is via the operation of the practice that the Act permits us to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine.  That is what we were doing and that is what we will be doing.  While I cannot predict as the council has to make that final decision, it is very likely to emerge through the consultation that it is the operation of the veterinary practice and who is providing the service and has their hands on the wheel that is very firmly in the hands of the practitioners in a practice.  The Act is clear on it.  It cannot be the case that a boss above the practitioners can allow them to reduce their ability to carry out what they should carry out.  The practitioners are answerable to the Veterinary Practice Act, the Veterinary Council, the codes, regulations and any limitations placed on certificates of suitability for practice, including in respect of premises which open to provide that service.  That is where our focus will be.  It is not that we do not care about it, but the owner issue is a secondary one and it is not in the Act.  We cannot go in there.<\/p> <p>  As to whether we want legislative change, we were not looking for it.  We were being asked a specific question.  There is no doubt that we had said several times that those making inquiries should seek their own legal advice.  We asked the Department and it told us to seek our own legal advice.  The Office of the Attorney General said it could not provide it.  \"Seek your own legal advice\" was our line for a long time but meanwhile practices were being purchased and matters were developing.  It is happening across the world.  As such, we needed to make a statement.  That was one we made before quickly realising we needed to do a consultation.  Our focus will be on who is providing the service, how the service is provided and on the fact that the service must remain completely independent and in the hands of the vets and nurses working at a practice or from a premises.<\/p> <p>  We are extraordinarily proud of the vets - ladies and gentleman - working in the northern, western, and southern seaboards, across the Twenty-six Counties, from Malin to Mizen, as I say.  They provide a fantastic service of which we are extraordinarily proud.  It is very tough to provide that service, which we recognise.  No one recognises that more than those of us who are actually giving that service.  One of the council's roles is to promote the practice of veterinary medicine.  It will, in time, require investment of some sort to maintain these practices.  They are acquired.  We are not like post offices leaving the villages or the banks leaving the towns.  We are still there and the role of the council is to ensure it does not make any change that might affect the service that is currently provided.  That will be our focus.  At all times, we will focus on ensuring that the vet has autonomy of service.  In response to Deputy Cahill, no one else is going to say who does what and when.  If a cow has a prolapse, it is the vet who is called who will decide how to deal with that prolapse or whether there is someone in a better position to do it.  It will not be the case that a vet will be involved in some contract which does not allow him or her to provide that service.<\/p><p>That cannot be the case.  The practices will be regulated and the vets will be the providers of the service for reward or otherwise.  Section 54 is quite clear on who can provide the service for reward or otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I will now bring in Senators Lombard and Mulherin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#L00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I have a brief comment on that answer to my question.

They believe they have been totally neglected by the Veterinary Council of Ireland, in particular through its refusal to intervene to ensure we get more vets who want to go into large animal practice from the veterinary school in UCD.  As we have all said, we do not produce enough vets for cattle practice and there is a shortage of cattle vets in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Another issue highlighted is that vets who qualify in other countries with lesser qualifications are being brought in.  They have no experience of large animal practice and may not have experience of surgery, such as caesarean sections, on a cow.  This is leading to complications in animal welfare.  Will the witnesses respond to this and set out how the council is addressing this issue?  We have corporate entities being created but the first step is to deal with the fact that there are not enough vets.  What can and will be done to address the prevailing circumstances?  Many of the vets who have complained spoke about severe emotional and physical distress and pressure in trying to keep up with the workload they have.  We all know dealing with large animals is a very heavy type of job and if people are under pressure, they could easily get injured.  It is far from being a desirable situation.  The fact it is not being addressed means more Irish qualified vets are being driven away from large animal practice because those working in them have no life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#L00700","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will answer Senator Mulherin.  Her comments that vets on the western seaboard have been totally neglected by the Veterinary Council might be a little unfair.  There is no doubt that quite a few years ago, perhaps four, five, six or seven years ago, we recognised it was hard to get large animal practitioners.  In fairness, UCD is a top class college and is world renowned, so much so that its graduates have the world at their feet and very often go abroad to further their education.  We recognise that times have changed.  Traditionally, many graduates on to the register here in Ireland almost immediately and then went into large animal practices.  If many of those graduates, who obtained very high points and were very highly achieving students and are highly achieving vets, do not want to work in large animal practices, we cannot make them want to do it.  What has happened, which is good, is that many Irish undergraduates who could not gain access to the Irish school are going abroad for their education and coming back.  This year, we noted that more of the new graduates on the register have come from abroad than from the Dublin school.  This has its own connotations and we will have to look at them.  These are Irish boys and girls who have gone abroad.  My daughter is away studying at present and there are many others.  She is in her second year.  In fairness, one must temper this particular point by stating the Dublin graduates can work in the US, Australia and a much wider field than the Irish graduates who go abroad for their education and come home.  There is no doubt it has helped.  A total of 26 from Budapest and 14 from Warsaw came onto the register as new graduates.  Almost every one of them indicated to the Veterinary Council of Ireland that he or she will work with large animals.  They are an extra tranche coming in and we are glad to see it.  We recognised the issue but the market is fixing itself.  This is to be seen across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I do not know whether the vets would accept this.

It might be that over the coming years the council will carry out research to produce reports that will seek to inform and influence policies in this area but it is outside the sole control of the Veterinary Council.

We are seriously chewing over this issue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny inquired as to what will happen if corporate entities buy practices and who will own and run them?  The running of practices is the focus of the Veterinary Council.  The question is who is providing the service, for reward or otherwise, to a third party.  That is where we have always been.  If a practitioner owns a practice and is married, does his spouse own half of it?  Is that the law of the land?  Ownership was not a question we went into.  We looked into the operation of the practice.  If I happened to have borrowed in the bad times, for example, the bank would have owned a lot more of me than I ever owned, but it could not influence my decisions or tell me how many blood tests to run, how many X-rays to perform or how many bottles of this or that to prescribe.  Those decisions are mine alone.  I operate the practice and I provide the service.  The Act is quite clear on that.  A body corporate cannot get involved in that and nor can a vet help it to do so.  A body corporate cannot provide any service.  The legislation refers to \"any act, matter or thing the doing or performance of which forms part of the practice of veterinary medicine\".  The reference to veterinary medicine means that it is a vet and a vet only.  The reference to a veterinary nurse is only in respect of veterinary nursing.<\/p> <p>  It would have been nicer for Ms Muldoon and I to come before the committee when our consultation was complete and at which time we could inform it to as to the point we had reached.

What was the catalyst for change and why did the change come about?  It is frustrating in here to see how long it takes when we try to introduce, develop or change legislation.

With the agreement of the committee, I would like to focus on the recent performance of the Irish beef and livestock sector, and I hope to address some of the issues being experienced as a result of difficult market conditions at present.<\/p> <p>  As members all know, the Irish beef and livestock sector plays a key role in the Irish economy, with over 100,000 farms involved in cattle production.  In 2018, from a supply base of approximately 1 million suckler cows and 1.5 million dairy cows, Irish beef production reached over 630,000 tonnes, of which 90% was exported.  Notwithstanding the serious challenges being faced by the sector which I will touch on in a moment, Irish beef exports were valued at a record &euro;2.5 billion last year, which represents a growth of 20% in comparison to the baseline period from 2012 to 2014 on which the Food Wise 2025 targets were set.  Over the same timeline, Irish cattle throughput at export meat plants increased by approximately 300,000 head, with significantly more animals coming from the dairy herd since EU quota abolition in 2015.  This contributed to an additional 90,000 tonnes of beef being available for export.  In respect of market channels, there has been a dramatic advancement in the number of European retailers and major food service customers committed to buying Irish beef, which now totals more than 115 key accounts.  As a result, Irish beef exports into retail are estimated to have grown by 30,000 tonnes, with a similar increase in the volume being sold into the quick-service restaurant chains.  These developments have been brought about as a result of the enviable reputation which Irish beef has achieved across key markets, based on its unique attributes of grass based production, family farms and a high quality product.  The importance of these attributes was clearly highlighted by in-depth research undertaken by Bord Bia over the past year with 22,000 consumers in 13 markets across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North America.  In markets close to home where Ireland is well known, such as the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy, Irish product is strongly associated with terms such as grass fed, pasture raised, natural production and a clean environment.  In markets in Asia such as China and Japan, Ireland&rsquo;s natural production system and robust food safety systems are, and will continue to be, key to building the reputation of Irish beef.<\/p> <p>  Of course, Bord Bia is also acutely aware of the difficulties being experienced by Irish beef farmers, particularly since last autumn.  Irish R3 steer prices were below the comparable European average male cattle prices for most of the past nine months, and have fallen by an average of 6% or &euro;0.23 per kilogramme for the year to date in comparison with the same period in 2018.  It should, however, be acknowledged that in recent years the improved market position of Irish beef has enabled cattle prices here to move closer to and exceed EU average producer prices.  Irish steer prices have exceeded the EU 15 male cattle average in six of the last eight years.  It is worth highlighting that prior to this decade, Irish prices had exceeded the EU average in just one year, for a period in 2008.  Most recently, for the week ending 11 May, Irish R3 steer prices averaged &euro;3.79 per kilogramme excluding VAT, which represents a recovery of &euro;0.15 per kilogramme in recent weeks.  By comparison, R3 steers in the UK are averaging &pound;3.55 sterling per kilogramme, which is equivalent to &euro;4.09 per kilogramme.  Across continental Europe, cattle prices are also behind last year&rsquo;s levels, and the weighted average price of R3 young bulls stands at just &euro;3.65 per kilogramme.<\/p> <p>  While my colleague, Mr. Brennan, can go into this in further detail, I will put some context on what is happening in the market.  In late 2018, the European beef sector was impacted by higher stocks of beef on the market, driven by higher EU production, particularly of cull cows, but also by increased imports of beef into Europe, predominantly from South America.  At the same time, exports of European beef into international markets recorded a 5% decline.  These factors collectively resulted in an additional 188,000 tonnes onto the supply chain, equivalent to 2.6% of total EU beef consumption.  Overall exports of Irish beef increased by 3% in volume during 2018 to 573,000 tonnes.  Similar to recent years, the UK market accounted for 52% of Irish beef exports, or 298,000 tonnes.  Exports of Irish beef into continental Europe grew by 3% to reach 250,000 tonnes, thereby making up 44% of total exports for 2018.  Meanwhile, exports of Irish beef to international markets declined to just 25,000 tonnes, and therefore represented just 4% of Irish beef exports.<\/p> <p>  Another significant factor within the Irish beef trade this spring was the level of uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit.  It is likely that many cattle finishers took the decision to market their animals earlier in fear of the possible consequences of a no-deal Brexit.  Cattle throughput has increased by 36,000 head to date this year, in spite of analysis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s animal identification and movement, AIM, system, which had suggested that supplies for 2019 as a whole were likely to decline.  A disorderly Brexit would have serious, long lasting consequences for the sector.  The potential implications of having to find alternative markets for more than 200,000 tonnes of Irish beef are considerable in terms of the potential damage it would do to the hard-fought position of Irish beef in key markets, as each market would need to absorb 60% to 70% more Irish beef.  It is very unlikely that this could be achieved at the prices historically achieved in the UK market.<\/p> <p>  Apart from Brexit, the beef sector faces other significant challenges, including an ever increasing stream of negative publications and campaigns that question the industry&rsquo;s right to exist.  This includes challenges to the sustainability of red meat consumption on the grounds of health and environmental impact, with the more extreme reports calling for beef consumption to be reduced by almost 80%.  For example, the recent EAT Lancet report suggests a daily red meat allowance of 14 g per day, which would equate to less than one quarter pounder per week.  Such reports are creating an increasing perception that red meat is not healthy among some consumers, particularly millennials, who are aged between 23 and 38.  As a result there has been a substantial and sustained rise in veganism, vegetarianism and, most particularly, flexitarianism.  This is a term coined for people who are consciously eating less animal protein.  Recent Bord Bia research suggests that up to one fifth of consumers in some European markets fit into one of these groups, particularly younger, urban dwelling consumers.<\/p> <p>  The sector is also under ever increasing scrutiny from NGOs in respect of animal welfare.  Last autumn, a Dutch NGO published an undercover report including photographs and video challenging the animal welfare standards on Irish cattle farms.  In each case, the investigators gained access to the farms under false pretences.  Thankfully, the industry has been able to counteract the report findings and reassure customers using verified facts and figures from audit data from Bord Bia&rsquo;s sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme.  It is clear that the power of NGOs continues to increase and the industry needs to have a clear plan for balancing the debate in a more proactive manner.  Otherwise it is likely to face further challenges to its social license to operate, potentially leading to declining consumption and, consequently, lower prices.<\/p> <p>  As already mentioned, the Irish beef sector has a lot of positives which are well recognised, but producers and the industry as a whole are continuously being asked to do more.  It should also be acknowledged that the sector has already embraced the sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme, SBLAS, and Origin Green, thereby providing a unique infrastructure with which to successfully counteract some of these challenges.  The introduction of the close-out model and a farmer help desk have encouraged membership of SBLAS to grow to around 52,000 certified farms currently.  As a result of the data collected during the audits of SBLAS farms, Bord Bia is in a position to make claims and to provide proof around some of our unique points of difference.  For example, our data show there is clearly space to do that on grass.  Numerous international research papers have shown that grass fed beef contains higher levels of iron and vital vitamins.  Grass fed beef can also point to higher omega 3 and conjugated linoleic fatty acid, CLA, levels, all of which help boost its human health credentials.  A specific grass fed claim has also been shown to add further marketing advantages for Irish beef in Bord Bia-commissioned research at consumer and trade levels.<\/p><p> The challenge currently to making that claim is that while there has been a widespread uptake, a considerable number of producers remain outside the sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme, SBLAS, which makes it impossible for Bord Bia to robustly make claims about the full lifetime of the animal and this in turn can weaken the strength of the claim being made.  To fully reflect the efforts being made on cattle farms across the country, every farmer needs to be encouraged to join the sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme.<\/p><p> Regarding Origin Green, following its launch in 2012, the early stages of the roll-out of Origin Green were all about building the programme, creating scale and proof points and, as a result, credibility with the market and customers.  As a result of the widespread support from farmers and industry, Origin Green has become more successful than could have been anticipated.  The programme has now established an awareness level of 27% among trade customers internationally and in the more traditional markets of the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, Ireland ranks in the top five of countries associated with sustainable food production.<\/p><p> However, with success comes challenges, as both market priorities and customer demands continue to evolve.  The blue-chip customers purchasing Irish beef have an ever increasing expectation that the sector can demonstrate real impact and improvement to allow them to make claims about the product on their shelves.  These evolving trends and expectations point to the need to regroup and focus on the production, marketing and promotion of Irish beef to help deliver a viable return for everyone involved in the sector.  It was against this backdrop, informed by market data, and built on significant consultation with industry at both farmer and processor level, that Bord Bia has updated its marketing strategy for Irish beef last year.<\/p><p> Our first priority when we look at the strategy is about focus.  Ireland currently exports beef to more than 60 markets across the globe.  Traditionally Bord Bia tended to treat many of those markets equally, essentially following the volume of exports.  As part of our new strategy the marketing investment is being focused on a core set of priority markets.  This approach is designed to deliver a better return on investment and allow Bord Bia to further improve the market position of Irish beef.<\/p><p> Germany is a good example of a priority market for Irish beef.  Over the past eight years, the value of our beef exports has risen by more than 250%, growing from &euro;45 million in 2010 to reach over &euro;165 million in 2018.  This reflects growth in export volumes from 9,500 tonnes to 27,000 tonnes, as well a jump of more than 25% in the average price per tonne.  Five years ago Bord Bia commenced the roll-out of a bespoke consumer campaign for the German market that focused on the sustainability credentials of Irish beef and on the family farm tradition in Ireland, which resonates strongly with German consumers.  Over the period, Bord Bia has invested around &euro;4 million in the campaign.  Under our new strategy, similar marketing campaigns are being implemented across other priority markets such as the Netherlands and Italy.<\/p><p> Our second priority is about new markets.  It is clear that the dynamics of the global beef trade will change dramatically over the coming decade.  Global beef import demand is expected to grow by more than 20%, with Asia accounting for half of this increase, rising by almost 1 million tonnes, principally driven by China.  This means that regions such as Asia look set to become increasingly important outlets for Irish beef over the medium term.  The reality is that in many of these markets do not know much about Europe, never mind Ireland.  A key focus of Bord Bia&rsquo;s strategy is to build awareness of Irish beef with key importers in these new markets.<\/p><p> Bord Bia's awareness-building activities in Asia will be supported by its execution of EU information and promotion campaigns.  These campaigns generally receive 80% co-funding from the EU, and therefore represent a valuable resource to highlight the supply capabilities of European beef and within that, of Ireland.  Two campaigns are currently taking place in the Asian region under the banner \"Enjoy it's from Europe\", including a &euro;3.75 million campaign across China, Hong Kong and Japan, as well as a &euro;4 million campaign covering the Philippines, South Korea and Singapore.  Activities include inward study visits to Ireland, technical seminars for trade buyers, media advertising and participation in multiple trade fairs.  At the same time, we are starting to see the scale of the supply challenges being faced by China and other Asian markets due to the escalation in African swine fever outbreaks.  This has the potential to significantly change the balance of the global meat market and drive prices upwards over the course of 2019 and into the medium term.  Our view, further informed by our recent trade mission to China only last week, is that this market will advance even more quickly than our original plans suggested and other Asian markets such as Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines are also showing significant potential for Irish beef.  Bord Bia has adjusted and continues to adjust its plans and programmes accordingly.<\/p><p> We all know that Ireland&rsquo;s greatest asset in the marketplace is its reputation, which has traditionally been built on traceability and data.  In order to further enhance our market position, we will need to protect and, where necessary, strengthen our credentials.  The third area of focus in Bord Bia&rsquo;s strategy is all about building robust proof points.  These proof points will focus on grass and animal welfare in the first instance, both of which we know are of significant importance to customers.  The unique infrastructure offered by SBLAS and Origin Green will play a key role in verification.  Delivery on these issues will require significant collaboration and buy-in from all parties across the sector, but it will enable us to protect the reputation of Irish beef and help differentiate us from our competitors.<\/p><p> Finally, because the market never stands still, Bord Bia is committed to maintaining a focused and targeted investment in market and consumer insights to anticipate potential new market opportunities for Irish beef.  There is no denying the seriousness of the current market situation and there is no denying that there are serious challenges to overcome.  All parties in the sector have a role to play in overcoming these and I am committing that Bord Bia will play its role to help deliver the maximum return from the marketplace.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for affording me and the team the opportunity to address them this afternoon.

As the Chairman said, they represent an important source of competition and an alternative outlet to the export meat plants.  Interestingly, for the year to date, overall live exports have increased by 36% and up to the beginning of May, 173,000 cattle in total have been exported.  The calf exports, which were the focus of much attention this spring, increased by 33% to 143,000 head.  There were significant increases even on the back of last year's high levels.   As a result of those, calf exports are likely to reach record levels this year, in spite of the difficulty posed by the capacity issue in the lairages in Cherbourg earlier this year, of which we are all too aware.  Bord Bia, through our market office colleagues, implements the promotion of our live exports in those markets.

I asked a parliamentary question two or three weeks ago specifically focused on targets for the last six months of the year for live exports, particularly cattle of six months and over.  I wanted to know what target had been set for the last six months of 2019.  The Minister stated that in respect of Bord Bia, no target or figures were being set for the last six months of the year.  I just cannot understand this.  I sat on the board of Bord Bia for six years.  If we got a new market somewhere or other, there was always a target as to how much beef we intended to get in there.  We have heard of this market and that market being open for live exports but the reality is that very little stock is moving.  We see a boat of 3,000 bulls the odd time, or this or that, and there is big fanfare about it but there is no competition at the ringside from live exporters.  It is not happening.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Burke talked about breeding a better calf, keeping calves at home, rearing them, sexed semen and so on.  The problem is that at the back end of this year, our kill reached 40,000 head and the price we were getting is just not viable.  I have never seen such despondency among beef farmers as is there at present.  When Bord Bia or anyone else produces a document on the beef industry - I can see targets of growth of 20% in comparison with the baseline figure - what must become compulsory is one for the primary producer as to what the return on beef farming is per hectare.  The return on beef farming has dropped and dropped significantly year in, year out.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest challenges facing the beef industry is our single farm payment.  Beef farmers are completely dependent on it and there will be one hell of a battle to maintain it in the future.  What worries me most of all in Bord Bia's statement is the beef price in Europe.  We cannot blame anyone for that but it is the reality we must face up to.  Ms McCarthy noted that across continental Europe, cattle prices are also behind last year's levels and the average price of R3 young bulls stands at &euro;3.65 per kilogram.  Has an analysis been done as to how the European beef farmer is able to survive at such a price?  His or her cost of production cannot be lower than ours.  If it is, there is something seriously wrong with the way in which they farm on the Continent.  One would imagine that the cost of production would have to be significantly higher.  If European farmers are able to produce beef at that price and make a viable return, we are in a cul-de-sac.  How are Europe's farmers coping with such a price?  How are they able to take it?<\/p> <p>  Ms McCarthy raised the challenges being made against the health of red meat consumption.  The dairy industry has a promotional body, the National Dairy Council, one of the main roles of which is to defend and promote the health aspects of having dairy in one's diet, which it has done very successfully.  Fifteen years ago, if one touched butter or cheese, it was deemed to be absolutely detrimental to one's health.  I think Dr. Nelligan was the first man to come out and say that dairy in a balanced diet was essential for one's health.  That battle on the dairy side, in my view, has been won.  Very rarely now do we see negative comments about a balanced diet containing dairy.  Does the beef industry now need a similar body to take on its opponents and the people who say that if one eats a steak, one is hammering a nail into one's coffin?  The dairy industry has defended itself exceptionally well.  Does the beef industry need to go down a similar route?<\/p> <p>  Bord Bia is focused on the family farm tradition in Ireland and has spent &euro;4 million on this campaign.  Again, how much scrutiny would this stand up to now?  We saw figures for January and February this year.  The figures that come to my mind are the amount of cattle coming out of our feedlots and the amount of cattle being sold into factories by agents.  Were one of our major customers to come in here and examine our figures, how many of our cattle would now be coming to the slaughter from family farms?  It is grand to portray the image but if some of our opponents took us on, to what extent can we stand over this in the future?  Our factories are fattening a lot of their own cattle now and the percentage seems to be growing.  Again, to what extent can we stand over selling ourselves as producing this green beef in a family farm tradition now?  The perennial chestnut in this regard is beef classification and the grid, about which there is huge dissatisfaction.  Technology has moved on.  I read an article just this morning which stated that it has been, I think, ten years since the grid was introduced.  It has been in operation for ten years.  I was quoted in the article as being as critical of the grid ten years ago as I am now, so at least I am consistent in my views on it.  With the advances in technology, surely there should be improvements in the technology in respect of the way in which the grid is done and the animal classified.  The amount of grazers on the grid is one thing but farmers are inherently unhappy with the classification and they rightly or wrongly feel they are not getting a fair crack of the whip on it.  I acknowledge the witnesses will say to me that Bord Bia has no role in this, which I accept as its job is the promotion of beef, but this is undermining farmer confidence and must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the positives, Ms McCarthy said beef consumption will rise, especially in Chinese markets.  I was surprised by the figure in this regard.  She said consumption will grow by more than 20% within the next decade and that Asia will account for half of this increase.<\/p><p>Will people have the same food tastes as ourselves?  Will the top-end or quality cuts be in demand in the Asian markets?  Will it be the lower end of the market that the increased tonnage will come from?  If so, then there will not be the same return for farmers.  What growth in price will the market realise?  There is mention in the presentation of swine fever.  There has been an impact on pig prices here.  There are only 360 pig producers left in this country and for the first time in a number of years they are starting to get a reasonable return for their endeavours due to the outbreak, but swine flu will come and go in Asia.  Will that market return a price that will make it viable for us to supply produce?<\/p><p> Climate change poses great challenges for farmers.  We have 2.5 billion cows in this country and the figure is rising.  There is a focus on climate change and a couple of weeks ago a climate emergency was declared in the D&aacute;il.  Whether we like or not, agriculture will be the prime target for the reduction of emissions.  Does Bord Bia believe we can win the argument with the general that we can produce beef from suckler cows in a climate-friendly way?  That is a major challenge because there will definitely be pressure on the agricultural sector to reduce emissions.  Does Bord Bia believe we can convince the public and make it sound credible that we can produce beef in an environmentally friendly way?  It will be a significant challenge to reduce substantially the emissions produced by the agricultural industry.<\/p><p> I am disappointed by the lack of focus in the report on live exports.  I am disappointed by the lack of targets for the rest of the year.  Live exports and the number of calves are at record levels.  Therefore, the number of calves exported this year will have no impact on the supply of cattle in 2020.  The number of men who are deciding to hang up their boots as regards beef farming is increasing rapidly.  I do not know how farmers on the Continent can produce a product at &euro;3.65 a kilo because there is definitely no economic return for us here.  Let us consider the family farm tradition, the National Dairy Council, NDC, equivalent and the lack of focus on farm incomes in presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#R00600","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  Again, I commend Bord Bia on a lot of its work.  It is important that Irish agriculture has a structure to market its produce worldwide, and to bring into focus the quality of Irish food and unique way in which much of Irish food is produced.  One of the downfalls, which I am sure Bord Bia is well aware of, is that the primary producer struggles so much to make a living.  That is the focus of what we are trying to work through here, in particular the beef sector.<\/p> <p>  Comparisons were made between the European average and where we are.  One of the things that has always struck me is that given the quality of products we produce, including animals that are grass fed, which is unique, the fact that we have family farms, which is unique in many ways, and the scale we work at, it should result in a premium price being paid to the primary producer, which is one of the core arguments.  How we succeed in doing so is what we are at but the consensus always seems to be that the farmer must become more efficient and produce more from less.  Being more efficient usually means being more intense. yet that intensity flies in the face of the market model that we try to market the product at, which brings me to the point made by Deputy Cahill.  He asked how we can stand over a situation where at least 10% and maybe up to the 20% of our beef comes from a very large feedlot model or an industrial-sized model for producing beef.  That situation would be detrimental not just to the current marketing model but the product itself.<\/p> <p>  Ms McCarthy stated that \"Cattle throughput has increased by 36,000 head to date this year\".  To correct the situation, have we reached a stage where we need to reduce throughput?  Should we soon reach a point where we say we are continuing to increase the volume?  Ultimately, from where we sit as representatives of farmers, we can see that processors and supermarkets are making a lot of money out of the extra volume while the primary producers make little or nothing.  Such a situation does not benefit the common good.  Therefore, we need to press the reset button and consider ways to do better.<\/p> <p>  Ms McCarthy made interesting points about the international market, including that approximately 4% of Irish beef is exported outside of the European Union.  I believe there is significant potential in such markets.  I know from talking to people about the Asian markets, particularly the Chinese market, that there is a view that anything produced in Ireland is of top quality, that people are prepared to pay a good price, and that there is potential to grow the market if we can do things properly.  We can only grow the market properly if we do so for everywhere.  There is no point in us going to China and telling people we have a unique product for which they must pay a top price when they can look at Europe and see that we are only getting an average price for our products.  We need to find a way to reset ourselves so that Irish beef gets a premium price everywhere that it is sold.  I understand that there are difficulties in doing so and I am not saying it would be easy.  At the same time, securing a premium price must become the focus for Bord Bia and farming organisations.  Everyone has a part to play in securing a premium price.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about the bad press that sometimes is given to the beef sector and beef production in particular.  There are suckler farmers in my part of the country.  In general, suckler farmers produce one thing - the calf - but they must keep a cow for a whole year to produce one calf.  Usually, due to the type of land suckler farmers have at their disposal, they cannot finish the calf but sell him or her on to somebody else to finish them.  Therefore, suckler farmers are at a great disadvantage.  Is there merit in considering alternative models of production for the region?  Many farmers have diversified and rear dairy calves on a contract basis, which works for some people but is not the entire solution.  Let us assume that an increasing amount of beef comes from an expanding dairy herd.  How can we stand over such a situation?  How can we produce the quality that we need to produce?  How much work has been done in respect of that?  Can that model get the premium price that primary producers deserve?  All of this, certainly from the point of view of Bord Bia, must be about the price received by primary producers.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in learning about the relationship between Bord Bia and the factories, processors and supermarkets.  Many people believe, and perhaps it is a misconception, that Bord Bia simply finds markets, makes contact, puts the two sides together and then walks away.  Bord Bia should act as a guarantor for the primary producer at home because taxpayer's money allows Bord Bia to provide these markets and thus it is unfair if only one section of the industry benefits.  I am talking about the beef sector but what I have said applies to all sectors of food produced in Ireland.  I will leave my comments at that and I again thank the witnesses for coming here this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#S00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the first part of the presentation by Bord Bia but I was called away for a vote.

What is its outlook for the trade, particularly weanlings and Friesian bull calves?  How does it feed into ensuring we have an appropriate market base for our beef going forward?  Will the witnesses comment on the levies on live animal exports, which I believe were reduced from &euro;4.50 to &euro;1.30 last year?  How has the reduction worked?

Deputy Cahill raised concerns on the attacks towards beef on the grounds of health and the idea that the dairy industry has successfully navigated this issue.  I would challenge that analysis because the attacks are coming from three different locations and to both sectors.  They do not come just from health but from environmental impact and animal welfare.  I would argue that dairy is being challenged just as hard as beef in those areas.  I stand over the fantastic work of the National Dairy Council, NDC, but I do not think the battle has been won by any means.  There is a challenge to all the industry to articulate its benefits better, whether that is the job of a brand new agency or the current infrastructure in the shape of the meat and dairy organisations and Bord Bia, which can provide data to those organisations.  Expertise is also provided by dieticians and there is a job to be done to co-ordinate that message.  The campaign attacking the animal protein sector is co-ordinated and both areas need to be grouped together rather than separated.  One has not done better than the other and both are equally vulnerable.<\/p> <p>  If we did not have Brexit, which is one of the biggest challenges facing our sector, the only thing we would be talking about is the challenge of climate change.  These are two significant challenges to our industries and they threaten their very existence.  I acknowledge the state of emergency but I suggest it is coming from the market as much as from this building.  Many farmers and the industry in general signed up to Origin Green, and that is a strong indication of how much the issue has been taken to heart.  The infrastructure has been designed and developed since 2012 so that we now have 52,000 farms on board, which is 90% of exports.  Some 95% of dairy farms are on board and we have a strong infrastructure to collect data.  We now need to move on to the improvement that is happening on farms.  A lot of work has been done and a lot of technical expertise is driving the improvement, such as by looking at the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, and the fantastic work Teagasc has done in this space.  There is a significant obligation on Ireland to illustrate the improvements its industry is making to justify its existence, never mind its expansion.  I am not saying it is easy but it will only be done by a coalition to look at and align all the targets collectively rather than by segregating them.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Brennan will talk about the industry structure and feedlots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Deputy Cahill asked about targets for live exports.  We view the livestock sector as vitally important to the viability of the beef sector in Ireland.  I accept that we do not have definitive number targets for the rest of 2019, as the Deputy suggested, but we are focusing on targets for how many buyers we can attract into Ireland to look at Irish cattle and livestock in the context of potential business opportunities down the track.  Whether they are from Spain, the Netherlands, Italy Turkey or Algeria, it is about how we undertake activities on the ground locally and how we make these people aware of the capability of the Irish livestock industry to supply the category and type of animal they are looking for.  Some of that work can sound a little bit distant but it is very important because in many of these markets there are many competitors and we have to tell them what is different about Irish livestock.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of focus on calves, and rightly so, particularly in spring, but a lot of focus is on growing other categories as well, such as weanlings and store cattle.  We need all categories of animal to have a number of outlets, whether they are live or dead.  We may have expected a more rapid increase in the numbers of live cattle exports over the past year or so, but there was a 20% increase last year, and this year to date we are up by 36% in numbers, which shows we are making progress despite the challenges the Chairman highlighted at the outset.  It is hoped we will continue to make progress in conjunction with the livestock exporters.<\/p> <p>  Irish young bull prices are 104% of the EU 15 average.  There is a viability issue across the European Union, though some producers have a slightly lower cost of production than we have with more proximity, greater availability of feed and their young bull system.  All we can do is deliver the best price we can to the markets and to the customers we are trying to find.  In six of the past eight years of this decade, we have been at or above the European average, while in the 2000s, we were only at or above the European average for one year.  We are making some progress in this area, though there is a lot more to be done.  There are signs that we are moving in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about the family farm structure and a discussion around feedlots.  The data in our quality assurance database show that there are 580 farms that slaughter more than 300 cattle per year.<\/p><p>Based on the audit information we receive, it is clear that the vast majority of those farms do not have feedlots under the international definition or anything close to it because there is a strong outdoor production process and a long grazing season in most cases.  In many instances, a farm only has feedlot status or a slaughter-only policy because of the herd's TB status, so it is difficult to know the exact number of what are defined as feedlots, but our information suggests that the majority of farms that might be classified as such are actually representative of the production system found on farms that are classified otherwise.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill was involved in the discussions on the grid from the outset, so he knows that its purpose was to be a reward for quality and to reflect what the market was looking for at the time.  As with every other area, things move on and markets change and evolve.  The grid is now more than ten years old, and I welcome the recent discussions on the possible need to review it.  That has been raised in a number of quarters.  Perhaps now is a good and opportune time, particularly in view of the changing dynamic in the industry in terms of where our beef is coming from.<\/p><p> Looking outside Europe, the Deputy rightly highlighted the growing importance of Asia to us as a market.  The figure of 20% is import demand rather than overall consumption.  We are likely to see at least that level of increase between now and 2027.  The Deputy raised a valid point about Asia's taste requirements or appetite for the cuts that we typically export.  In China, for example, a different set of cuts are more popular.  We view this in two ways.  First, a market like China offers an opportunity to deliver a better return for some cuts that garner a low return in the European market.  This adds overall value to the animal.  Second, the demand for higher quality cuts in markets such as China is increasing, evidence of which we saw as recently as last week.  Next month, we will be in Japan and Korea and will see exactly the same trend.  There is a high-value part to those markets.  We are probably in the early stages.  The first product from Ireland only arrived in China last September, meaning that we are still only six or eight months into developing trade in that market.<\/p><p> We have all heard much about African swine fever in recent months.  It is a grave issue for China.  Something that struck me in China last week was that it would have a structural impact on that market for a prolonged period.  The people that I spoke to locally were considering structural impacts for the next five or seven years at the very least.  This year alone, the most recent forecast suggests that 18 million tonnes less pigmeat will be produced in China.  This means that China will need to find the equivalent in imports.  Whether it is chicken, pork or beef, though, that volume of product does not exist anywhere else in the world.  As such, there will be a strong demand in China for beef and pigmeat.  Granted, we are in the early stages of developing these markets, but it presents an opportunity for us to establish ourselves there in the way we would like.  As the markets evolve and grow, they have the potential to deliver a better overall return for the animals that are produced.  That return goes to the primary producer in the form of the price that he or she can achieve.<\/p><p> I will turn to the other questions.  Ms McCarthy might also contribute.  Regarding price levels, Deputy Martin Kenny is correct about our grass-fed and outdoor production systems.  They are unique strengths, and we rely on the sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme, SBLAS, to provide us with the figures to back that up.  In any market that we enter, we are an import supplier and it can take time for us to make the most of these strengths, so we need the facts and figures at our fingertips to demonstrate that it is not just a photograph or statement and that we can back up everything we are telling the customer.<\/p><p> A question was asked about our relationship with the customer and whether we just put the processor and the customer together and walked away.  That would be the direct opposite of what we do.  Ms McCarthy outlined our revised marketing strategy for beef.  It is all about how we get close, and stay close, to our key customers and how we build and secure for Irish beef a profile and position with each of them.  One might start at a certain level with a customer, but there is the potential to grow the volume and value of the business over time.  More and more of our investment will go towards working with individual customers and trying to increase and improve the profile and position of Irish beef with them.  It is not a question of securing or facilitating the business and walking away.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny asked a valid question about whether we need to reduce output.  Consider the dynamics of the global market - there will be an increased demand for beef globally.  Obviously, we will have a more mature market closer to home in Europe, but where we focus and how we export our beef will change.  In terms of managing Ireland's output, Bord Bia's focus is on ensuring that we have as many markets and customers as we can open to and consistently buying beef from Ireland.  That helps to minimise or, as it were, reduce the risk that we have seen in recent months of a higher output.<\/p><p> Senator Lombard asked about the strategy for livestock exports.  I will leave those to my colleague, Mr. Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I will add two points to Mr. Brennan's comments on beef consumption in China.  It is important to remember that we do not have a strategy of trying to westernise the diet of people in China.  Rather, we are trying to ensure that Irish beef has a position within Chinese recipes and in how they design their food.  Four master chefs will visit Ireland next week.  They have custom designed different regional cuisines, for example, Cantonese, to show how they would cook the Irish beef cuts available in their market and propagate same in China.  We are not telling people to eat a steak because that is what the Irish do.  Rather, we are looking at their recipes and ensuring that our cuts match them.  This is a more efficient use of the funding that we have available and it will give rise to a longer-term gain.<\/p> <p>  I will build on Mr. Brennan's point regarding our relationship with supermarkets.  We also seek cross-sectoral opportunities.  For example, when we speak to a supermarket about dairy, we also look for an opportunity in the context of beef.  When speaking about beef, we look for an opportunity in respect of seafood.  Instead of limiting our conversations to just one sector, we are continuously looking at food brand Ireland and all of the opportunities to cross-promote or cross-sell into the market in order to ensure broad access to buyers.  That has been one of the benefits of our cross programmes and of placing our Origin Green ambassadors with key accounts.  We learn from them as much as anything else.  From a talent perspective, we have taken the new initiative of placing our assets, if I might put it that way.  I am referring to professionals whom we are working with through a student network with University College Dublin.  We place them with our accounts.  By that, I mean that we have our supply chain students placed with Tesco, Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, Sodexo and Sainsbury's in order to understand better how their supply chains and decision-making work and then bring that intelligence back to the industry with a view to ensuring that Ireland positions itself well to face the challenges that may arise.  In terms of sustainability, we have, through our Origin Green programme, similarly placed our assets into businesses.  Be they customers or non-customers, they are always thought leaders.  Ireland is using an opportunity at every point to inform itself about what the best in class are thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I will tackle Senator Lombard's first question on the live export trade and whether there is a strategy to maximise numbers.  Our focus tends to be on analysing the markets and categories and providing market insights to commercial exporters regarding the potential that exists within those markets.  Our focus is also on meeting new contacts within those markets, be they mature or existing markets for calves or new international markets, and gaining access through organising trade missions in conjunction with the Department and the Minister.  Another focus is on co-ordinating inward buyer visits where possible.  This has been a useful vehicle for kick-starting trade in some markets.<\/p><p>In terms of specific numbers, some of the markets that had appeared to be opening up and presenting new opportunities are volatile at the moment.  The difficult war-like situation in Libya, for example, is limiting opportunities.  As a result of a political decision, no imports are being allowed in Turkey at present.  The issuing of import licences has been suspended.  The visits we have had from Turkey over recent weeks have given us hope that Turkey looks set to issue licences and open up imports again.  We have the contacts in place to maximise the opportunities for Irish exporters.<\/p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine levy, which is a veterinary sign-off that clears animals for export, has been reduced from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 per calf on foot of some lobbying in recent years.  That has had a significant benefit.  There are approximately 300 calves on every lorry or truck with calves that leaves the country.  Therefore, the reduction in the levy has led to a net saving of more than &euro;1,000 to the exporter in each case.  The Bord Bia marketing levy of &euro;1.90 per live bovine animal exported is also significant.  This means a budgetary contribution of more than &euro;500,000 is made as a result of live exports across all the animals that are exported.  We invest that on behalf of the livestock sector in the various activities I have discussed, including the market insights and the promotional activity.  That is the situation in relation to the Bord Bia levy.<\/p><p> The suckler herd is a key area of focus.  We have taken on board with interest the trend of decline that has been evident in recent years.  There was a decline of 45,000 in suckler calf registrations last year, and there has been a decline of 35,000 so far this year.  More animals from a dairy background are coming through the system.  The suckler sector is part of our point of difference.  It is one of the unique selling points of Irish beef.  Many suckler-based animals are seen in Bord Bia's marketing materials that promote Irish beef.  When we bring in customers, this sector tends to resonate well with buyers.  We tend to focus on bringing them to suckler farms so they can see the commitment of farmers to breeding good stock and bringing animals through the system.<\/p><p> The positive attributes of the suckler system include the welfare related benefits of having animals with their mothers at grass for between six and eight months.  We have brought those benefits to the level of applying for an EU promotional campaign.  The campaigns that are taking place in Asia are more about discovering the potential of these markets and utilising the funding that is available through the EU.  This is another opportunity to maximise the benefit of the suckler herd.  We have applied for EU funding, but there is no guarantee that our application will be successful.  We have seen the opportunity that exists within the Italian and German markets.  We have applied for this campaign in respect of suckler beef.  We see this as being potentially useful.  We hope we will be successful.  In recent years, we have seen that, on balance and on average, we have been successful with just one in four of these applications.  In this case, we have used our consumer research in these markets to target affluent consumers who represent an ideal potential customer for this type of product on the basis that these animals come from a high-welfare sustainable background.  These unique attributes mean that our campaigns resonate well with such consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019052100002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Burke believe that ten years from now, the profile will have changed dramatically or these kinds of numbers will have continued?

We actively co-ordinate or help different sectors to look at that model.<\/p><p>We have a slightly different remit within horticulture because of the legacy of Bord Glas.  We have a stronger producer responsibility in that sector than we do in co-ordinating the type of activity mentioned.  We endorse it as a strong model.  It allows smaller producers to bring scale to their offering, prepare themselves to receive market messaging back and co-ordinate funding.  As an example, while helping producer groupings in horticulture prepare for Brexit, we were able to introduce the concept of lean production to them in the form of a pilot.  Those groups could then explore that idea within their own infrastructures to get that best practice model accelerated into their businesses.  We strongly endorse that model going forward.   I thank the Senator for the question.<\/p><p> Vertical integration is a very different business model regarding the cashflow funding involved.  That is also the case in respect of Ireland's business model regarding land usage, as well as the infrastructure associated with vertical integration, as opposed to family farms and our grass-based production system.  Pigmeat and poultry are intensive industries and our beef industry is not closely aligned with those models.  There has been closer co-operation in the context of contract suppliers with different beef producers.  In that instance, production models have been piloted and investigated.  The Kepak KK Beef Club comes to mind, as well as the new 2020 model that Glanbia and Kepak are exploring.  While that is not absolute vertical integration, it does seek a further alignment from start to finish and to send much clearer messages.  There is a strong structure within the beef industry, which largely involves family farms and that is another factor in the fragmented nature of that industry as well.  The working capital needed to finance the number of years involved would also be different from the speed to market in the poultry industry.  It is a very different industry structure.

It would not have been ready in March either.  We have had access to the market in China since last April.

It is 4,000 tonnes and not hundreds of thousands of tonnes.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned that Ireland has a fantastic reputation.  We do in certain categories but our beef is not known in Asia, for the most part, at a scaled level.  We are brand new in that market.  There was no beef from Europe in the market until we got access and this concept of beef from Europe is a very new one.  We have much work to do to build our brand and expand our exports in Asia.  If the question is whether that market will take 200,000 tonnes in the next two to three years, I have to state that will not be the case.  That level of exports has not been forecast by anyone.  We are exploring the longer term and Asia is providing very strong signals to the floor of global prices.  That is a positive for us.  It is beneficial for European beef when the floor of global prices rises.  We are then able to explore new opportunities and it also provides other outlets for South American beef.

May I introduce our team, Ms Dara Deering, head of retail banking, Mr. Barry D'Arcy, our chief risk officer, Mr. Brendan Mahon, the head of our arrears solution team and myself, Peter Roebben, the chief executive officer, CEO, of KBC Bank Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We understand the importance of these hearings and of the role of members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  As elected politicians, the members represent our customers and the people of Ireland and we appreciate this opportunity to engage with the committee.  We will answer any questions following completion of my opening statement.  If we do not have the answers immediately to hand, we will endeavour to secure a response in a timely manner.<br\/><br\/>I am delighted to have been appointed as CEO of KBC Bank Ireland.  This country is vibrant, outward looking and ambitious for its people and places a premium on innovation, which is an exciting prospect for a bank like ours. <br\/><br\/>While I am new to Ireland and arrived at a good time, into a thriving economy and society, that does not mean I am unaware of events in Ireland&rsquo;s recent banking past.  I see it as essential to my mandate to show our customers that we have absorbed the lessons necessary for embedding positive change, ensuring that their needs stand at the centre of KBC&rsquo;s way of doing business. <br\/><br\/>The process of change has already begun in KBC, with a comprehensive transformation plan being put into place step by step.  This plan will be underpinned by the values we hold throughout KBC Group, for which we use the acronym &quot;PEARL&quot;, which stands for performance, empowerment, accountability, responsiveness and local embeddedness.  This means that in KBC, we embrace the diversity of our teams and customers in all our local markets.  I recently had the pleasure of meeting the chairman of the Irish Banking Culture Board, the retired judge Mr. Justice John Hedigan, with whom I was extremely impressed.  I am pleased to share with members that my colleague, Ms Dara Deering, will be representing KBC on that recently established board. <br\/><br\/>My experience has taught me that for cultural change to be credible and sustainable, it takes time, hard work and one must have a clear horizon to move towards.  It starts at the top but must ultimately engage every last member of our staff.  It also requires that all financial institutions work together towards that horizon with the common goal of rebuilding trust in the sector.  It is my intention that KBC Bank Ireland fully embraces Irish society&rsquo;s call for change.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>KBC represents choice in Irish banking.  We are committed to making banking as easy as possible for Irish people.  Customer needs are changing rapidly.  We understand this, which is why we are combining customer service with unrivalled digital capabilities to deliver an unique, innovative and transparent banking experience.  We provide the kind of ease and convenience for which people are looking, so they can get on with living their lives. <br\/><br\/>We are building a model of banking of the future with customer ease at the heart of it.  The recent launch of KBC multi-banking, means that customers of KBC can now check the balance of current accounts held with other Irish banks through their mobile app.  We are the only bank to have opened our banking app to third parties through the digital walls of external providers.  We were the first to the market with the recently launched two socially responsible investment funds, SRI.  These funds are designed to balance environmental and social good and offer more investment opportunities to socially conscious consumers in Ireland.  For customers seeking person-to-person interaction, our KBC hubs have longer, more customer friendly opening hours, and our contact centre is available 24-7, 365 days in the year.  We are stepping up to extend this innovative approach with a KBC business banking service specifically designed for micro-SMEs in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>Our recently-published first quarter results tell a positive story about the choice we offer in the market.  More than 18,000 new customer accounts were added in the first three months of the year, bringing total customer numbers to just under 300,000.  We disbursed some &euro;216 million in new mortgage lending, which represented an increase of 9% year on year.  The digital mobile activity on our apps increased by 50% year on year.  The model works.  Overall KBC Bank Ireland reported a net profit of &euro;15 million after tax and impairments for the first quarter of this year<b>.<\/b><\/p><p>These results show that customers are seeking that alternative choice in the market.  The remaining non-performing loans at KBC Bank Ireland now concern primary dwelling homes.  Our approach here remains as it has been for some time to reduce these non-performing loans in an organic way.  In this, communication is key and every effort is made to establish and keep open communication channels with every individual customer who is experiencing difficulties meeting his or her repayments.<\/p><p> In my first few weeks of arriving here, I visited our arrears solutions unit - which is headed by Mr. Mahon - to gain a clear understanding of what is happening on the front line.  We have a special team that looks after the most sensitive cases and I sat down with them to look through some of the cases currently at hand.  When it comes to the issue of non-performing loans and arrears, I believe that we should continue to tread carefully.  In every case there is a person and a person's home.  We must remain conscious of the vulnerability of those who find themselves in difficulty, and behave accordingly.<\/p><p> All arrears cases that are related to a borrower&rsquo;s principal dwelling house are afforded the benefit of the mortgage arrears resolution process as set out under the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The success of these mortgage arrears solutions at KBC is evident in the number of arrears cases where resolution options have been implemented.  In some 90% of its arrears cases, borrowers have agreed a resolution option with KBC over the years.<\/p><p> Resolution options remain available at any time to the constructively engaging borrower, regardless of a borrower&rsquo;s history, and at all stages of the legal process.  The loss of a home is a significant trauma in someone&rsquo;s life.  That is why we insist on repossession being an action of last resort, coming at the end of an extensive process designed to identify a solution that keeps the occupant in their home.<\/p><p> The tracker mortgage examination has been a top priority for KBC and we are determined to right the wrongs experienced by our customers.  We do not anticipate material changes to the number of cases for redress beyond the figures that we published at the end of the first quarter.<\/p><p> We would like to again acknowledge our errors in relation to the administration of tracker mortgages and as newly-appointed chief executive officer, CEO, I add my sincerest apologies to those of my predecessors to those affected.  I also publicly commit us to taking on board the lessons learned on behalf of our customers.<\/p><p> The Irish economy has begun 2019 in good stead, with domestic economic activity underpinned by strong increases in employment and an improvement in household spending power.  While an emerging weakening of global economic growth will restrain Irish activity, the UK and US economies have performed better than expected of late and this has supported Irish export growth.  A young, well-educated and growing population, allied to encouraging trends in the public finances, an ambitious infrastructure programme and significant foreign direct investment suggest scope for the Irish economy to remain on a healthy path in coming years.<\/p><p> With regard to Brexit, we can only take note of the ambiguity around the whole process.  To this point, we have seen no material effect on KBC activity or our customers' relationship with us.  The nature and scale of the long-term impact of Brexit on Ireland will depend on a range of factors.  We remain watchful but whatever happens, I believe KBC Ireland is as ready at it can be.<\/p><p> In summary, KBC Bank Ireland represents choice in banking in Ireland.  It is my mandate to stay in tune with changing customer needs and to innovate for more convenience and transparency, thereby continuing to grow our customer base.  At the same time we are very aware of the need to stay in tune with demand for change in Irish society.  That is also part of my mission.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Roebben.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#G00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Roebben to his first meeting at this committee.

Some the witnesses may be familiar with this meeting format from previously and perhaps they have looked at transcripts and recordings of earlier meetings.  The opening statement was relatively upbeat and the witness is fairly positive about the economy.  I am struck by the positivity in Mr. Roebben's statement compared with that of his predecessor who, if I am right, indicated that we are closer to the next recession than we are to the last one.  That line has stuck with me ever since he made that point.  While Ireland is relatively fortunate with corporation tax receipts, low interest rates on our national debt and so on, there are many uncertainties including Brexit, as outlined by the witness.<\/p><p>Since our last meeting with KBC I have heard anecdotally from people around the country that lending has almost stopped and people are very wary of taking on debt, which is possibly not a bad thing in some ways, but there is much less take-up.  Many people are worried about Brexit, the US-China trade wars, stock market decline and various other matters.  What are Mr. Roebben's thoughts on where the economy is going?

I was analysing that in my previous job as head of credit risk globally for the KBC group.  Our chief economist, who keeps a close eye on things here, is still quite upbeat about the immediate expectations in the Irish economy.  We still expect 3.5% GDP growth, which is slightly more conservative than the IMF forecast of 4.7%.  The outlook is still positive.  We consider it from the retail client perspective.  Our mortgage distribution is up 9% year on year.  The year started a bit more slowly than we expected.  At the end of last year and in the first month of this year activity was less but we saw it pick up in February and March, which for the time being is continuing.  On the retail side, what probably happened was the scare around Brexit at that time, which kept some consumers back from taking the step but that seems to have recovered.  It is true that house prices are a concern.  Affordability is a real issue for many potential borrowers.  That has to do of course with the imbalance between offer and demand in terms of new housing coming to the market although our expectations are that 22,000 new dwellings will come onto the market this year at the present rhythm, compared with 18,000 units last year.  Our estimates, however, are that approximately 35,000 units per year would correspond to normal demand and would offer balance in this market, so we are still somewhere behind where we should be.  In that sense, we remain relatively optimistic.<\/p> <p>  There are many uncertainties there.  I am hardly an expert on Ireland after seven weeks so I will be humble about that but Brexit is a big sword of Damocles over expectations for growth but it can go in any direction.  The recent announcement of the European Central Bank, ECB, to keep lower interest rates going for a much longer term is the fuel for continuous growth.  I have summed up several elements that I think plead in favour of the short-term economic outlook for Ireland.  I am ill placed to answer how that potentially affects lending or investment demand in companies because it is not a market in which we are very active.  I can give macroeconomic figures but not a real personal feeling from our bank's point of view. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>KBC as a brand here in Ireland is relatively new but I think most of us are cognisant that IIB was a predecessor bank, which had a very long presence in Ireland albeit not at the retail level that KBC is engaging with now.

It is not that we will move to a future where there is no personal engagement but we see the branch, as the Senator calls it, or the hub, as we like to call it, as a place where a person can have a personal interaction with another person on the bank's side as a support channel.  Today that is very mixed.  There is still a group of customers that would prefer to go to the hub and speak with someone there first and then move to make transactions on a digital channel.  More and more, and we see this in other markets, the group of customers that wants to engage digitally, even to onboard digitally and will only ask for personal support be that physical support, through a contact centre or an electronic interface application - I will not mention brand names - is growing, such that last year in our traditional home market of Belgium, 56% of clients did not go to a branch.<\/p><p>A full year passed without them having to go to branches.  When we were making projections two years ago about this strength, we totally underestimated it.  I am too recent in the Irish market to put that into context here.  Ms Deering may be able to provide more background because she is more versed in that regard.  It is a trend that is happening across our markets.  In terms of our experience in other places, the take-up of digital starts slow, grows gradually and then takes off very fast.  Once the model has reached a particular phase and people start taking it up, with word of mouth it grows faster.  There will always be need for a place where the customer can interact personally with an adviser, more and more the interactions will generally be done digitally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>To put those numbers in an Irish context, nine out of ten of our customers do not go to physical hubs.

Different customer segments may want face-to-face contact, particularly where investment or a major decision is involved.  The reality, as evidenced in other markets, is that face-to-face contact may not be the traditional physical face-to-face any more, it may be video or some other mechanisms as well.

What I was interested to discover - I think it is quite unique - was that we had written as a legal obligation under the code of conduct.  We have already written to all of these customers twice to inform them, given the situation they are in and the loan-to-value they are at, that they might qualify for a lower rate.  The rates are then published.  They receive an individualised communication.  It was done at the end of last year and again in March this year.  Of that group, we saw approximately 5,000 customers who made a switch.  Others have not, but the number is increasing.  Writing to customers has had an effect compared to last year when the group was 4,000 or 5,000 larger.  It varies, depending on individual cases.  The Senator quoted an average figure.  Among the group of clients on standard variable rates, the average mortgage is much lower than our total average mortgage.  It is approximately &euro;79,000; therefore, it is much lower.  It depends on whether it is sufficiently interesting for the client, but there is always a saving.  However, it is for the client to judge whether he or she wants to go through the process.  The only condition is that a client obtain an official valuation of the property; therefore, the value of the property is officially documented.  Otherwise, the process is very smooth.  When clients receive such a communication which we intend to send once a year, the group that will make the switch will increase in size.

As a certain bank manager said to me a long time ago, a person was more likely to change her husband or his wife than her or or his bank account.  That level of inertia stemmed from it being too much trouble to change a bank account, similar to a mortgage.

Yes, I am aware of the Irish division.  I do not think this is unique to Ireland.  What happened in Ireland of course went much further and much deeper than what happened in other countries in Europe and where KBC is active.  What happened here was therefore very much on the group's radar and we discussed it.  To give the Senator some context, we held last year a two-day session with the entire top 300 of management in KBC Group to discuss the issue of culture and the topic of responsible behaviour and how to bring it into the group's work.  The special experience of what happened here in Ireland was on the agenda very explicitly as an example of things that should not be allowed to happen and can never happen again.<\/p> <p>  Let us talk about KBC Bank Ireland and KBC Group.  Regarding risk management, oversight and governance internally, there has been a sea change between what happens now in our institution and what would have happened ten or 12 years ago.  Structurally, a whole lot of measures have been taken to ensure better and more independent control.  There is a totally independent CRO, three lines of defence and so forth.  This is obvious now but that was not the case looking back ten or 15 years ago, when I could go through a whole technical list of governance issues.  There is also a totally different regulatory environment now with a lot of interventions that provide some needed checks and balances on the banking market.  The third component is the more difficult but also the more fundamental one: how one gets well-balanced behaviour in organisations.  This is about making sure that the output-versus-outcome trade-off is constantly being made.  On the one hand we must carry out cost-benefit analyses in generating return on economic capital but, on the other, we must be aware that every decision has an impact on clients.  Basically, the question is whether a decision enhances the well-being of the client.  Is there a fair balance in how costs and benefits are shared between the bank and the customer?  Ultimately, are the decisions we make scalable?  Something that might be a good idea in the short term could turn out to be a very bad one in the long term.  Something that might work very well for a particular type of customer could backfire badly if one were to start expanding it across the market.  The trick is to find a way to have that dialogue going on constantly at every level in the organisation.  This is a journey that has only just begun.  If one could fit this into a big rule book and go to page 25 and find the answer to a given question, it might be easy.  The reality is that life is very complex and opinions can differ as to what the right balance is.  At the core, this is about getting a dialogue going in an organisation and keeping it going at all levels, not only top down and bottom up, but also horizontally, peer to peer, and creating internally a culture of transparency whereby these doubts can be put on the table such that people can ask, \"Should we do this?  Should we make this decision on this product?\"  I could give examples from elsewhere in the group where one must carry out this management of dilemmas, because that is what it is.  It is part of the normal way of doing business.  Some things are very simple; we know we do not have to do them.  We of course do not do things that are forbidden by law.  Day to day, however, all of us are involved in decisions that incrementally can lead us on a wrong path.  The Senator asked me where we are.  We are at the beginning of the journey, and it will never stop.  It is a continuous journey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I appreciate the level of honesty and the depth of Mr. Roebben's response.

To be fair, the KBC representatives have acknowledged this.  There is always a dilemma between trying to make money while acknowledging that the company is in a relationship with the customer which is very important.  The customer must be at the centre of everything each day.  Sometimes that might mean making less money.

It has affected their entire family loan circumstances.  Throughout the opening statement, reference was made to vulnerability.

I will take one particular example of a vulture fund buying a mortgage for less than &euro;70,000 and then selling it for &euro;170,000, so it made &euro;100,000 straight off.  The fees for the receiver and the legal fees take &euro;35,000 from it.  Then the vulture fund goes back to the mortgage holder and demands, as happened in one particular case, an extra &euro;20,000 on top.  What is difficult for me to understand is why this could not be negotiated with the mortgage holder in the first instance.  KBC is facilitating vulture funds by the sell-off of these non-performing loans, or what it calls non-performing loans as in some cases they are split mortgages.  I dispute the definition of non-performing loans.  The fund is already making &euro;100,000 out of it and it wants a further &euro;20,000.  There is unfairness built into this.  Banks such as KBC are leaving mortgage holders to the mercy of vulture funds that not only charge them the receiver fees and legal fees and make a huge profit, but then go back for more.  The definition of a vulture is to go back and pick the carcasses.  What is happening is the carcasses of these vulnerable people about whom the witnesses spoke in their opening statement are being picked by vulture funds and it is having an enormous impact on the lives of the families with whom I am dealing.<\/p><p>That is why I am interested to know how many loans have been affected and the write-down that has been given to the vulture funds, most of which come under section 110 so they do not even have to pay tax on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#N01600","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1558393200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The Senator is referring to the sale of non-performing loans that we closed last year.

It is an important decision as members will have seen the percentage of non-performing loans.  We apply the European Banking Association and European Central Bank definition so it is a standard definition and not one that we have invented.

There are limited opportunities for first-time buyers to purchase properties.  Supply is increasing but when we strip out the houses that are, quite rightly, being built as social homes by local authorities and approved housing bodies, the entire developments being bought by REITs or investment funds, and one-off houses in rural areas being built by qualifying planning applicants, the number of properties actually available is quite small.  I am sure the bank would like it to be more given that it is a key part of its business.  There is also an affordability crisis.  Supply is very tight but the cost of building in Ireland has risen significantly in recent times.  It is not as simple as diagnosing it as a supply problem.  There is also an affordability problem.  Not all new developments are selling very quickly because the homes are expensive and we have the macro-prudential rules.

What we do observe is that it is very clear that, at the core, there is an imbalance between offer and demand.  This is undeniable.  Our economists estimate that where the market is today it should absorb 35,000 newly built units per year and we are on the path to add 22,000 this year.  Last year, the figure was approximately 18,000.  We have an imbalance and this has been going on for some time.  It is building up and the economy is doing very well.  Unemployment is at an extremely low rate.  We have this tension that leads, particularly in certain areas, including Dublin, which is very important for our business model, to prices that pose an affordability problem.  This is a clear fact.<\/p><p>On the prudential rules, quite honestly, I believe it is good that the Central Bank of Ireland puts limitations into the market.  One of the big lessons that came out of the previous crisis - in the Irish market and in all the other countries where we have a presence - is that we see the central banks intervening in the definitions of the rules, the level of which depend on the local circumstances.

Before I arrived in Ireland I personally looked at how we approach non-performing loans because I am aware of how sensitive and important the issue is in Ireland and for KBC Bank Ireland.  Our policy has been, and remains, to really look for every possible option to individually engage with every customer.  This affects people and their houses so it is always a difficult situation.  If one looks back over the period since 2009 - we went back that far - some 90% of the people going into payment difficulties arrears have ended up with a restructuring solution.  I gave the statistics earlier.  There are 55,500 live private dwelling mortgage cases, of which 85% are paying normally and working very hard to pay every month.  Of the live cases, 10% - or 5,500 people - are performing under some form of restructuring solution with the mortgage arrears restructuring process, MARP.  We also have some 3,300 customers, which is really the most difficult part, that go 90 days arrears or more.  We are still able to engage with half of this group to find solutions.  There is, however, no contact or engagement with the remaining group.  We cannot reach those clients and so cannot talk with them.  This is the difficult part.  As long as communication is going on and there is dialogue then we will find some sort of arrears solution.  It is in everybody's interest and certainly in the bank's interest.  It is very thorough.  The legal process is the very last place we will go.  If nothing else happens the independent courts and the legal system are the only way to find some kind of closure, but only after a very long process over many years.  Even if one goes through the legal process it too is a lengthy process and at any time in the process if the customer is willing to engage we are open to go out of that process again and find a common solution.  With this very thorough process we have learned a lot over the years.  The options available have expanded.  When one considers the people who are on the arrears solutions, gradually one sees an increasing number moving out and improving.  They have come through the difficult situation.  There is, however, a cohort of people who are in a very difficult situation.  If no dialogue is going on then it is very difficult to advance.  I believe the KBC process is extremely thorough and the attention we pay to it in Ireland has impressed me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019052100002#W01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Roebben"},{"type":"speech","time":1558393200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I would not expect Mr. Roebben to know all about the eviction that took place in Strokestown in Roscommon, which happened down the road from me but would he accept that KBC nationally has lost face over the way that was handled?<\/p><p>As the Deputy noted, I cannot comment on specific cases, particularly when legal proceedings are ongoing.

Th&aacute;inig trian de na gear&aacute;in &oacute; dhaoine i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus ceann as gach uile ch&uacute;ig cinn &oacute; dhaoine sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Ar&iacute;s, ghoill s&eacute; orm mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga nach raibh ar mo chumas thart ar leath de na gear&aacute;in a rinneadh liom a fhiosr&uacute; de thoradh, den chuid is m&oacute;, gan dualgas a bheith ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; cuimsitheacha Gaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  Bh&iacute; an fhadhb maidir le h&uacute;s&aacute;id ainmneacha agus sloinnte i nGaeilge go m&oacute;r sa nuacht le deireana&iacute;.

Ba &iacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad uair a fiosra&iacute;odh na for&aacute;lacha reacht&uacute;la teanga de chuid an Achta Craolach&aacute;in 2009.
