At &euro;1.88bn, 2020 will see the highest level to date of spend on higher education in a single year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This funding will provide:\u00a0<\/p>  <p> - For the launch of the Human Capital Initiative with &euro;60 million in 2020, providing an additional 3,000 student places.<\/p>  <p> - &euro;19 million to address demographic pressures, accommodating a further 2,700 places.\u00a0<\/p>  <p> - A multi-annual fund of &euro;90 million to assist the development and progression of Technological Universities (TUs).<\/p>  <p> - Funding of &euro;3.3 million to promote excellence in research.\u00a0<\/p>  <p> - Funding of &euro;2 million for student mental health and wellbeing initiatives in the higher education sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 will deliver an additional 2,700 new undergraduate student places through investment of &euro;19m in 2020. This is reflective of the growing demographic pressures in higher education. This is part of a &euro;60m increase in current funding to provide for increased student numbers over the three year period 2018-2020.<\/p>  <p>  Increased demographic provision will be supplemented by the expansion of places in Higher Education in priority skill areas under the Human Capital Initiative (HCI). Through this fund an additional 1,500 undergraduate and 1,500 graduate conversion places will be provided in 2020.\u00a0 This equates to a total of 5,700 additional student places in higher education in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The HCI will be a transformative development for the third level sector. The HCI will invest &euro;300 million in Higher Education over the period 2020 to 2024. Funded from the surplus in the National Training Fund, the HCI will help to realise the objectives of Project Ireland 2040, Future Jobs Ireland and the National Skills Strategy. At &euro;60 million per year over the next 5 years, it will form a key part of our strategic response to addressing the skills needs of the economy,\u00a0 mitigating Brexit risks, responding to digitalisation and the future world of work, and preparing ourselves for other challenges that the economy may face.<\/p>  <p>  In order to actively address increasing demand on wellbeing, I have announced ring-fenced funding of &euro;2m which will assist institutions in supporting students with their mental health and wellbeing. This is in addition to existing spending, in the region of &euro;7m, by institutions in the area of &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.<\/p>  <p>  The objective Research Excellence fund\u00a0is\u00a0to strengthen the international competitiveness and visibility of Ireland&rsquo;s research capability.\u00a0\u00a0 Excellence in research emerges on the basis of international competition and collaboration, and these are increasingly important, especially in addressing today's global challenges. Ireland's research system is well regarded internationally in relation to factors such as academic freedom, a culture of open intellectual engagement and support for innovation. <\/p>  <p>  As part of a programme of planned reforms\u00a0of the National Training Fund the\u00a0levy has increased from 0.7% to 1.0% between 2018 and 2020. The increase in the Training Levy has yielded an additional &euro;190 million for investment in the tertiary education sector over this period. This investment has facilitated the huge growth we have seen in apprenticeship numbers, a 40% increase in participants in Skillnet Ireland programmes, and has led to the creation of the important ETB Skills to Advance programme.<\/p>  <p>  Through Budget 2020 my Department\u00a0has\u00a0committed &euro;27m in additional funding to\u00a0 further the\u00a0expansion of the apprenticeship programme with over 7,500 new registrations on craft and new apprenticeships. An additional &euro;8 million will support 7,000 additional participants on Skillnet Ireland programmes including a new digital skills initiative and an SME upskilling scheme. The ETB Skills to Advance programme will be supported with an additional &euro;6 million to allow for the upskilling of an additional 3,000 people in the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, I am confident that\u00a0this substantial level of addtional investment in third level education will bring significant benefits both for individuals and in terms of enhancing the skills available across the Irish economy to equip us for an ever-changing environment locally, nationally and on the global stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700040#WRB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Services Staff","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700040#WRB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[42542\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700040#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the talks in respect of industrial action being undertaken by school secretaries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools. \u00a0I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2020\u00a0I increased the number of secretaries in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries, and schools with enrolments of 626-699 will be permitted to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two posts filled.

Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes,\u00a0any staff taken on to\u00a0support those functions are employees of individual schools.\u00a0 Specific responsibility for\u00a0terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of\u00a0a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries\u00a0and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.\u00a0 This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys\u00a0on the 10th of July\u00a0to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)\u00a0to resolve the dispute.\u00a0 As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700040#WRB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Curaclam Scoile","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700041#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[41408\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700041#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil s&eacute; chun &aacute;bhar &eacute;igeantach a dh&eacute;anamh athuair den stair i gcomhair an Teastais Sh&oacute;isearaigh, agus cad iad a thuairim&iacute; ar an &aacute;bhar sin.","asker":"1305","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>I m&iacute; na Samhna na bliana anuraidh d'iarr m&eacute; ar an gComhairle N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Curaclaim agus Meas&uacute;nachta (CNCM) athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an stair a bheith ina h&aacute;bhar roghnach faoin gCreat nua don tSraith Sh&oacute;isearach.

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I was alarmed to learn of the executions of three people in July, including two human rights activists. A moratorium on the death penalty had been in place in Bahrain since 2010, and we saw the resumption of capital punishment in Bahrain in 2017 as a very negative development. Ireland condemns the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Along with our EU partners, Ireland calls on Bahrain to again introduce a moratorium on executions, as a step towards the abolition of the death penalty. <\/p>  <p>  I am also aware of reports of inhumane detention conditions as well as allegations that political prisoners in Bahrain have been tortured. I understand that a large number of prisoners held in Jau Prison in Bahrain went on hunger strike in response to these conditions. Ireland\u00a0urges all States to\u00a0safeguard\u00a0the human rights of prisoners and detainees and\u00a0is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.<\/p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. In our Item 4 statement at the Human Rights Council in July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial. Ireland also took the opportunity at the most recent Council in September 2019 to reiterate its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has signed five Human Rights Council joint statements on the human rights situation in Bahrain, which expressed concern on a number of fronts including the mistreatment of detainees, repression of demonstrations, and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality without due process.

As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils. The scope of the relatively narrow original zero rating of food supplement products permitted by Revenue broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. This caused difficulties for both Revenue and industry. <\/p>  <p>  Following a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following this review, Revenue engaged with the Department of Finance concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018.

The full list, detailing each of the available FRE allowances for 2019, is published on the Revenue website. <\/p><p>I am aware that over the past 18 months, Revenue has been conducting a comprehensive review of the FRE regime.\u00a0 Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the FRE review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.\u00a0 Each category of FRE allowance is being examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements.\u00a0 I understand that the review may result in increases and decreases in several FRE categories, the withdrawal of the right to avail of the FRE allowance in certain categories and the introduction of new categories where appropriate.\u00a0 Revenue have advised that a flat rate expense allowance can only be retained to the extent that there is a legislative basis to support the right to tax deductibility in respect of the expense.<\/p><p>Revenue has advised me that its FRE review is nearing conclusion, with an implementation date of 1 January 2020 for all changes to the FRE regime to make sure that employees in any one sector are not impacted on earlier than employees of another sector.\u00a0 Revenue will be publishing a comprehensive list of all FRE allowances for 2020 in advance of the implementation date.<\/p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that it is not possible to accurately quantify the anticipated increase in tax revenue arising out of any abolition or reduction of FRE allowances, as the cost of such allowances vary depending on the particular circumstances of the individual recipients, for example, the extent of their income subject to tax and whether income is subject to tax at the standard or marginal rate. Moreover, a breakdown of the cost and numbers by reference to each employment category in which the FRE regime currently operates is not readily available. Prior to 2018, Revenue&rsquo;s systems were not designed to identify FREs as a separate item from expenses generally.\u00a0 However, the current (2018) Income Tax Form 11 and Form 12 tax returns now have specific questions on FREs, which will allow Revenue to segregate FREs from expenses claimed generally. However, final figures for 2018 are not expected to be available until mid-2020 to allow for processing of the data from income tax returns and cross referencing across Revenue operational systems.

What might be seen as normal Budgetary elements such as modest income tax reductions and across-the-board welfare rate increases did not feature. What did feature, however, were sizeable targeted expenditure increases in a number of sectors. These will have a positive impact on society to be factored into a balanced assessment of the Budget, rather than focusing solely on the fact that income tax and welfare payments remain largely unchanged. <\/p><p><b>Employment Affairs and Social Protection<\/b><\/p><p>A carefully targeted social welfare package, benefiting the vulnerable elderly, families and carers was introduced in Budget 2020.

The document is available at this link: <\/p><p><b>Expenditure<\/b><\/p><p>As set out in Expenditure Report 2020, the focus of the core element of Budget 2020 is on providing for sustainable increases in public expenditure. This is in recognition of the key role of public services and infrastructure in supporting our citizens and promoting the resilience of our economy, particularly in light of the increasing risks in the global economic environment. Particular focus was placed on maintaining and improving supports for children and families, as well as for elderly people. <\/p><p>In order to protect the most vulnerable in society, Budget 2020 provides an allocation of over &euro;21 billion for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The significant provision of supports provided through the Social Protection system represents an important strand of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling poverty and social inequality in Ireland. <\/p><p>Gross current expenditure for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will see an increase of over 6% in 2020, rising to almost &euro;1.6 billion. As well as increased funding for Early Years Care and Education, central to this allocation is funding for the continued roll-out of the National Childcare Scheme.<\/p><p>&euro;17.4 billion in current expenditure will be allocated to the Health sector in 2020, a year on year increase of over 6%. This investment reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to create a more responsive, integrated and people-centred Health system. New measures such as a reduction of prescription charges for over 70&rsquo;s, the expansion of free GP care to all children under 8 and free dental care for children under 6 will all contribute to improving access to health and social services across the country. <\/p><p>The Housing programme in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will see an increase of 11% compared with 2019, bringing the total allocation to almost &euro;2.6 billion (including current and capital expenditure). This allocation will support the Social Housing needs of over 27,500 households in 2020. This includes the delivery of 11,167 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes as well as supporting 16,350 new households under the HAP and RAS schemes.<\/p><p>Further details of these measures and all Budget 2020 allocations can be found in Expenditure Report 2020, which can be found on budget.gov.ie.<\/p><p><b>Carbon Tax<\/b><\/p><p>Budget 2020 included an increase in carbon tax of &euro;6 per tonne, which is expected to raise &euro;90 million in 2020. The funding raised is to be directed to support increases to existing climate related schemes or new schemes that would not have been provided in the absence of this increase. Government has been clear that the importance of clear action in this regard must be balanced with measures to promote equity during the transition. The revenue raised in 2020 will support:<\/p><p>- &euro;34 million in funding to protect the vulnerable through an increase in the fuel allowance and energy efficiency upgrades;<\/p><p>- &euro;31 million for schemes to ensure a just transition to a low carbon economy, including measures with a particular focus on the midlands;<\/p><p>- &euro;25 million for programmes that can help all citizens to reduce their carbon footprint. <\/p><p>These measures are set out in more detail in the paper published alongside the Budget on 8 October, &lsquo;The Carbon Tax Increase &ndash; What it Will be Spent On&rsquo;.

Equality Budgeting aims to provide greater information on the likely impacts of proposed and ongoing budgetary measures, which, in turn, enhances the potential to better facilitate the integration of equality concerns into the budgetary process, avoid unintended adverse outcomes and enhance the Government&rsquo;s decision making framework. It involves Departments setting concrete measurable targets for equality objectives in the Revised Estimates Volume and reporting on progress in the Public Service Performance Report. For the pilot exercise, a number of diverse policy areas were selected with associated objectives and indicators. The learnings from the pilot were used to inform the expansion of the equality budgeting initiative to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. An Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group has also been established. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance Equality Budgeting policy and progress the initiative.<\/p><p>Future direction will now be assisted by the recent publication of the OECD Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland which sets out a path forward with a number of recommendations for consideration. This work was commissioned by both the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality. \u00a0The scan recommendations \u00a0are aligned with international experiences of best practice in this field.

This approach complements the budgetary impact assessments carried out using the SWITCH (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) model by the Department of Finance and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and externally by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).

However, affordability and accessibility of quality childcare is a major concern for many parents and can act as a barrier to employment which, in turn, increases the risk of poverty.

Therefore, it is the responsibility of each public body to ensure the continued delivery of public services as they are best placed to assess and develop contingency planning in relation to their own contracts, including the specific risks associated with Brexit. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The OGP has written to all Government Departments advising them to identify and manage any potential risks and to put in place the necessary detailed contingency plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700042#WRD07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700042#WRD07200"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[42781\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700042#WRD07300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide all correspondence between him and-or his office and-or his advisers and-or the Secretary General and-or the office of the Secretary General and the Department of Health in September 2019 to 10 October 2019.","asker":"1349","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":253,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that a deferred reply will be issued to him in respect of this Parliamentary Question, in line with Standing Order 42A.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700042#WRD07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700043#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[42821\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700043#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if funding will be provided for works on a river (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes and catchment drainage schemes designated under the Arterial Drainage Acts of 1945 and 1995.

This is addressed under Pillar 4 of the Government's Future Jobs Ireland strategy. Pillar 4 is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force as this will lead to the more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce. <\/p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland outlines a number of key ambitions and deliverables to help to increase participation in the labour force. A number of these ambitions are centred on flexible working solutions which offer potential benefits for employers, employees and wider society in general. Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work-life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key deliverables under Pillar 4 with the objective of fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. These include deliverables such as holding a national consultation on flexible working options, the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options, and the extension of unpaid Parental Leave. <\/p>  <p>  A further deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working. My Department is currently leading on this research which focusses on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research will also identify the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working.<\/p>  <p>  This research will include desk research, a national employee survey, and one-on-one consultation with key stakeholders. The recent report published by the Financial Services Union on the impact of technology on employees will be considered as a part of this process. The research will also include an international policy review which will consider the &lsquo;right to disconnect&rsquo;, as currently in place in France, in order to understand the impacts of this on remote working. A further input to this project will be the results arising from a Remote Working Stakeholder Forum which I held in the Cavan Digital Hub on 18 July. <\/p>  <p>  The research will be completed in Q4 of this year and will be published shortly thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700045#WRG05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700045#WRG05800"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[42788\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700045#WRG05900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will provide all correspondence between her, her office and her advisers and the IDA in January 2019.","asker":"1349","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>It\u00a0has not, in the time available, been possible to provide the requested\u00a0correspondence\u00a0from the period in question.

Over the years additional funding has been provided for home supports, for transitional care, for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, for aids and appliances and to provide increased capacity in both the acute and community settings.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply and over the last number of weeks we have seen significant increases in delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is engaging extensively with the HSE in the context of planning for winter, including the response to the current challenge. An additional &euro;26m has been made available for the last quarter of 2019 to support the hospital and community system to improve patient egress. The investment is supporting home support and transitional care as well as keeping the waiting time for access to support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) at 4 weeks to the end of the year. The HSE were authorised to take immediate action in that regard last month, and released significant support to over 700 people to take up places under the NHSS and over 300 transitional care bed approvals. My Department is continuing active engagement with the HSE with regard to planning for the winter ahead.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under Budget 2020, the Government has made improved access to home support services a priority. We have committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in Budget 2020 to bring the total funding for home supports to &euro;487 million in 2020.\u00a0In 2020 the HSE will deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support, representing a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and, as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand in Winter 2020, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for our older citizens.\u00a0Over the last two years, an additional &euro;45million has been provided to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme budget. In 2020, the NHSS will see a further investment into its budget of &euro;45 million, bringing its total annual budget to &euro;1.03 billion.<\/p>  <p>  While I am mindful of the present pressures and challenges, there is a need for longer term planning and action. Last year I established an expert working group to carry out an independent expert review of delayed transfers of care.\u00a0The review was established in recognition of the need to identify focused actions that will ensure that older people who are fit for discharge from hospital are supported to return to their homes and communities as early as possible. The Group reported its findings in November 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The review recognised that delayed transfers of care are caused by a multitude of factors and it made nine recommendations which include the development of a national policy to provide for a more consistent approach to recording delayed discharges, strengthening data collection, standardising definitions and ensuring consistent discharge guidelines.\u00a0\u00a0The report underlines the importance of hospitals and communities working together to improve patient flow. This is in line with the overall direction of an integrated care approach, expanding community-based care to bring care closer to home, as outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I subsequently requested the HSE establish an appropriate multi-disciplinary structure to progress implementation of the recommendations. Arising from this a HSE Implementation Group has been established. I have also established\u00a0and chair a Cross Divisional Oversight Group within the Department of Health to oversee the HSE&rsquo;s implementation of the recommendations.\u00a0Work is progressing well and last month the HSE hosted a collaborative learning event amongst staff to assist with the development of medium to long-term solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700046#WRH05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services Provision","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700046#WRH05500"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[42694\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700046#WRH05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if respite will be provided for a child (details supplied) in Dublin 11; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The Secretary General restated the Government&rsquo;s view that the service should be normalised and available in the community as close to patients as possible.  He also reiterated the Minister&rsquo;s requirement that all nineteen maternity hospitals\/units should be able to offer services to women.    <\/p>  <p>  In April 2019, the Secretary General wrote to the Interim Director General of the HSE to raise concerns in relation to the lack of progress regarding the full implementation of termination of pregnancy services across all maternity hospitals\/units. While acknowledging the very substantial work by the HSE to ensure that services were introduced from 1 January, the Secretary General expressed the Minister&rsquo;s disappointment that services were still not available in early pregnancy in all nineteen maternity hospitals and units. The letter requested the HSE&rsquo;s attendance at a meeting with the Minister to detail plans to bring service provision in line with Government policy as quickly as possible. The Interim Director General responded to acknowledge the contents of the Secretary General&rsquo;s letter and to confirm that the HSE would attend the meeting. <\/p>  <p>  In April there was also an exchange of correspondence between the Department's Acute Hospitals Policy Division and the HSE National Women and Infants Health Programme in relation to the rollout of termination of pregnancy services in the acute hospital sector. The Programme confirmed that termination services in the hospital setting was working well, and demand was within the planning parameters. The hospitals\/units providing services were noted and a detailed update was provided in relation to hospitals not providing services in early pregnancy (up to twelve weeks of pregnancy). In response, the Department requested clarification in relation to hospitals not providing services in early pregnancy. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2019, National Director of Acute Strategy and Planning in the HSE wrote to a Principal Officer in the Department with a briefing note on termination of pregnancy services. The brief detailed the services being provided in hospitals, listed the hospitals providing services in early pregnancy and outlined plans for service expansion in further hospitals.  The Minister also wrote to the Director General in May, requesting a further update on the expansion of termination of pregnancy services in early pregnancy in the remaining maternity hospitals\/units across the country. The Minister requested a more detailed report on the HSE &lsquo;My Options&rsquo; telephone helpline, and information on arrangements put in place by the HSE for reviews to be carried out under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In June 2019, the Director General replied to the Minister, outlining the plans in place to expand termination of pregnancy services in a number of further hospitals and addressing the approach in the remaining sites.  The Director General provided a report on the My Options helpline, which included details on the number and type of calls received (information \/ support \/ counselling).  Finally, he addressed the Minister&rsquo;s request regarding arrangements for reviews under the Act and undertook to provide further information on same. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the HSE to ensure full implementation of the service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700047#WRJ05675","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Correspondence","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700047#WRJ05700"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[42775\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700047#WRJ05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a copy of letters and-or emails from a person (details supplied) to the HSE on 2 April 2019.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>The following is the information that relates to the matters referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The officer in question works in my Department's Acute Hospital Division, the division with responsibility for maternity services.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro, ongoing investments. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) in Multiple Sclerosis.<\/p>  <p>  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress Ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.<\/p>  <p>  Application 2 is for the use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded, the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.\u00a0 The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. As of September 2019, there have been 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines approved for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.\u00a0 The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.\u00a0 In June 2018, I signed\u00a0the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.\u00a0 In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700048#WRK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund Data","counter":599,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700048#WRK02400"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[42819\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700048#WRK02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding drawn down by the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019; the amount of funding in each year spent in procuring services from private healthcare providers; and the amount spent in the public system in tabular form.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":601,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improving waiting times for hospital procedures. <\/p><p>In 2017, National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) was initially allocated funding of &euro;15m to address waiting lists.\u00a0 A further &euro;2.5m was allocated in late 2017 in order to further reduce the number of long-waiting patients and also address those patients waiting for complex treatments such as complex spinal and cardiothoracic surgery.\u00a0Budget 2018 announced a total allocation of &euro;55 million for the NTPF, and Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing to &euro;75 million in 2019.<\/p><p>The NTPF has advised that the funds drawn down in relation to 2017 and 2018 were &euro;17.5m and &euro;55m respectively and estimates that &euro;75m will be drawn down by the end of 2019.<\/p><p>The NTPF further advises that in 2017, patient care expenditure amounted to &euro;13,050,001.

As part of that growth, 13 new services were successfully secured\u00a0with Norwegian Air International and Air Canada, both of which used Boeing 737 MAX jet aircraft. Unfortunately, the grounding earlier this year of the Boeing 737 MAX jet aircraft has disproportionally affected Shannon Airport. Separately, and\u00a0without warning, Kuwait Airlines announced in January last the immediate cessation of its daily trans-atlantic service via Shannon Airport.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that these developments,\u00a0which are totally outside the control of Shannon Group,\u00a0will result in a fall in passenger numbers for Shannon Airport for the first time in six years.\u00a0 However, I am\u00a0aware that Airport management are very focussed on addressing these challenges and are in constant\u00a0discussion with numerous airlines with a view to providing additional flights from Shannon Airport.\u00a0 The decision to operate a specific air route is however an operational matter for airlines themselves, in consultation with airport authorities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in 2019, additional funding was made available to Tourism Ireland for its Regional Cooperative Marketing Fund, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.25 million. This fund seeks to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing services to the Regions.\u00a0\u00a0It is supported by contributions from regional tourism stakeholders (airports and ports) and matched by air and sea carriers.\u00a0 This\u00a0resulted in total cooperative marketing expenditure overseas of &euro;2.5m in 2017 and &euro;2.65m in 2018.\u00a0\u00a0As recently announced\u00a0following Budget 2020, funding for this Scheme is being increased further to &euro;2.5m in 2020.\u00a0 I would encourage all\u00a0regional airports, including Shannon Airport and Cork Airport to continue to avail of this funding to optimise air services and increase connectivity to the regions for passengers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700050#WRM02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700050#WRM02400"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[42875\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700050#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of capital projects that cost &euro;100 million or more in the past five years; the cost of outside consultants for each of the projects costing &euro;100 million or more; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":740,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.\u00a0 The\u00a0National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure.<\/p><p>Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I also have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design and\u00a0construction of individual national\u00a0roads\u00a0is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII)\u00a0in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.\u00a0<\/p><p>Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply.\u00a0<\/p><p>Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days from the\u00a0National Transport Authority (NTA) or Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700050#WRM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":742,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[42891\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700050#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of capital projects anticipated to commence in the next five years that cost &euro;100 million or more; the expected cost of external consultants for each project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":743,"content":"<p>The Project Ireland 2040 Capital Tracker\u00a0published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides details of infrastructure projects, indicative allocations, current status, project commencement dates\u00a0and proposed\u00a0completion dates.

The HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 2 working days of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.<\/p>  <p>  HAP is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. Budget 2019 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;422 million. This will allow for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Exchequer allocation also provides for the recoupment to the HAP SCC the costs associated with the administration of the HAP scheme. HAP SSC staff and administrative costs are recouped quarterly.\u00a0 The HAP SSC currently have 74 staff. Sanction requests for additional staffing resources were received in Quarter 1 2019.\u00a0 These were approved by my Department; no additional requests have been received.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under\u00a0the HAP\u00a0scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord. \u00a0 The HAP application form comes in two parts, Section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and Section B to be completed by the landlord or agent. An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both Section A and Section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation. \u00a0Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application. \u00a0The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. <\/p>  <p>  HAP application processing times within local authorities may vary. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP Shared Service Centre.\u00a0 If there are delays at the processing\u00a0 stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority.\u00a0\u00a0The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.<\/p>  <p>  To support local authorities in the implementation of the HAP scheme my Department provides a once off administrative payment of &euro;150 per HAP household to all local authorities.\u00a0 This administrative payment recognises the resources required to manage the HAP process.\u00a0 The payment is made directly to local authorities twice yearly, to offset HAP staffing and administrative costs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  At the end of Q2 2019, there were\u00a0over 48,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 28,000 separate landlords and agents in receipt of monthly HAP payments.

When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalized, and before affordable dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.<\/p><p>In order to support the delivery of affordable homes to buy or rent, the Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), from 2019 to 2021 to provide infrastructure support for the delivery of some 6,200 affordable homes. To date, two calls for proposals have been made under the SSF, resulting in\u00a0funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas,\u00a0being allocated for infrastructure works on sites that will support the\u00a0delivery of almost 3,200 homes. Of these 35 projects, two of them are in Galway; one in Galway City Council\u00a0and one in Galway County Council with the potential to support the delivery of a cumulative total of 125 affordable homes.<\/p><p>Details of all SSF funded infrastructure projects can be found on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links: \u00a0<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>In addition to making discounted homes available for purchase, the Government is also committed to the development of &lsquo;Cost Rental&rsquo; in Ireland. Under the Cost Rental model, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less both the profit margin seen in the private rental sector and\u00a0any financial supports provided by the State\/local authorities.\u00a0 With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case. <\/p><p>In order to drive delivery, two early mover pilot projects are being advanced, one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and the other at Emmet Road in Inchicore.

My Department also has a remit to comment on a variety of licences under the Wildlife Acts with the aim of helping to protect biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  In support of the work carried out by local authorities, I have made a commitment in the coming years to double the funding my Department makes available for local Heritage and Biodiversity Officers to implement biodiversity actions at local level and to tackle invasive species. A pilot grant scheme was introduced in 2018 to assist local authority led biodiversity projects and I am pleased that we have extended this scheme in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to local authorities using the funding available  for projects aimed at tackling invasive alien species in their areas. Invasive alien species are a significant threat to our biodiversity and can also have significant adverse effects in terms of the cost involved in implementing eradication or management measures. I want therefore to enable locally led works and also to raise awareness around invasive alien species and biodiversity matters more generally.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also preparing legislation to implement the EU IAS Regulation and this new legislation will strengthen and update existing legislative provisions around the management and control of invasive alien species in Ireland. This is another important measure to protect native species. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Article 17 Report was submitted by my Department to the European Commission in April 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, 85% of habitats are reported as being in Unfavourable status. The main drivers are agricultural practices which negatively impact over 70% of habitats, particularly ecologically unsuitable grazing, abandonment and pollution. The Unfavourable status of many habitats is not surprising as this is the reason they have been listed on the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in a range of targeted activities to address these issues at regional, national and EU level, and also liaises with other departments, particularly the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to implement policy and practices which will help tackle the drivers of biodiversity loss. <\/p>  <p>  The status of species is somewhat better: 57% assessed as Favourable and 30% assessed as being in Unfavourable status, with 72% demonstrating stable or improving trends while just 15% demonstrated on-going declining trends. Progress is being made and a number of species such as bats, otter, pine marten and grey seal are doing well.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the need for a coherent cross-sectoral response to the biodiversity crisis, earlier this year I announced our 'Seeds for Nature&rsquo;, a range of commitments to be undertaken by public authorities and other stakeholders to drive implementation of actions in the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Biodiversity underpins all aspects of our lives and society. Halting biodiversity loss is not simply a matter for a single agency or department. However, my Department is the lead for implementation of biodiversity policy in Ireland and takes this responsibility very seriously and will continue to work across a range of areas, engaging across sectors, to tackle biodiversity loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700052#WRO04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700052#WRO04700"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[42783\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101700052#WRO04800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will provide a copy of all correspondence between her and-or her office and-or her advisers and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to date in 2019.","asker":"1349","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":897,"content":"<p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service is an integral part of the Heritage Division of my Department with a wide ranging remit.
