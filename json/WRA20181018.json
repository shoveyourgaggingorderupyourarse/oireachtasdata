My Department&rsquo;s vision is to make Ireland the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable full employment and higher standards of living across all regions of the country. My Department incorporates climate action into policy making; funds research related to climate change; and, through its agencies, assists enterprises to reduce emissions and achieve greater energy efficiency.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of enterprise policy, the Government&rsquo;s national enterprise strategy - Enterprise 2025 Renewed - emphasises the effects of climate change and the imperative for sustainable development. We know that the development of the low carbon economy presents commercial opportunities to companies across many sectors in Ireland, in addition to the desired environmental benefits. Enterprise 2025 Renewed recognises that we must support enterprises to develop and adopt innovative technologies, products and services that increase efficiencies, reduce waste and deliver sustainable development.<\/p>  <p>  The ambitions set out in Enterprise 2025 Renewed are given effect through supporting strategies such as the Action Plan for Jobs; the Regional Action Plan for Jobs; and Innovation 2020; as well as, through the National Planning Framework which has a strong focus on the development of sustainable enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs (2016\/2017) and the Action Plan for Rural Development (2017) called for an examination of the scope, feasibility and conditions necessary for the development of the bioeconomy and the publication of a high-level policy statement on the bioeconomy. The Government&rsquo;s first National Policy Statement on the Bioeconomy, which my Department contributed to, was published earlier this year and highlights the potential of the bioeconomy in promoting the more efficient use of renewable resources while supporting economic development and employment in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  A key policy measure will include the development of the Future Jobs Initiative. This new initiative, which the Government approved in July will replace the Action Plan for Jobs. It will set out a new economic pathway and focus on:  <\/p>  <p>  - building resilience through improving productivity especially among Irish SMEs; <\/p>  <p>  - enhancing skills levels and increasing participation in the labour force; and <\/p>  <p>  - preparing for, and exploiting, the anticipated transformational changes arising from technological developments and the low carbon and digital economies.<\/p>  <p>  A key motivation for Future Jobs is the recognition that climate change is having a pervasive impact across all sectors and on how we do business. Increased consumer awareness of environmental issues, international developments, regulation and industry responses are all driving growth in the global clean technology sector. <\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs will be discussed at a National Summit in November which will be attended by key stakeholders from industry, academia, civic society and public administration. Future Jobs, to be published in early 2019, will prioritise cross Government actions from 2019 onwards to ensure that, whatever the future may hold, Ireland will remain a leading and advanced economy succeeding internationally.<\/p>  <p>  I would also draw attention to the work of our agencies in partnering with their clients. The NSAI, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland all have programmes in place to assist enterprises in the context of transitioning to low carbon and sustainable business models. These include supports for improvements to enterprises&rsquo; energy and environment systems and also innovation and R&amp;D supports related to the bio economy.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, enterprises themselves have responsibility for transitioning successfully to the low carbon economy, and ensuring they operate a sustainable business model. The National Plan on Corporate Social Responsibility, &lsquo;Towards Responsible Business&rsquo;, encourages companies to go beyond compliance and to consider their impact on the environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Question No. 6 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[42694\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps she has taken in budget 2019 to encourage and promote job creation in counties Longford and Westmeath and across the midlands; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made jobs and enterprise in the regions my top priority. Enterprise development has been central to our success in reducing unemployment from a high of 16% to 5.4% at the end of September - the lowest level in over a decade. <\/p>  <p>  The Midlands has seen good progress, with employment in the region increasing by 14% from Q1 2015 to Q2 2018. In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the Midlands of 6% and 1% respectively. Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have 819 client companies in the Midlands employing 4,214 people; and last year those companies added 387 new employees in total. <\/p>  <p>  I am happy to say that in Budget 2019, I secured an increase in my Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m.<\/p>  <p>  Regional development was one of my three main priorities for Budget 2019 and I approved a range of measures to drive indigenous enterprise development and regional growth. <\/p>  <p>  I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 LEOs, up 22% on 2018. LEO's have a presence in every county, including Longford, Laois, Westmeath and Offaly, to support start-ups and growth and in particular to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. This will include a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, to be rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme is critical to encouraging more foreign direct investment into the regions. So, I was pleased to announce an allocation of &euro;10m to the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme to include Athlone. The IDA is involved in a number of initiatives to attract additional FDI to Westmeath and Longford, including a focused digital marketing campaign.<\/p>  <p>  I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I also secured funding for a new phase of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme out to 2024. The new scheme, which is worth &euro;175m, will be oriented towards seed and early stage investments, where there is a very clear market failure.<\/p>  <p>  I announced an additional &euro;1.8m investment for the Design Craft Council of Ireland (DCCOI) which will assist craft enterprises all over the country to develop and generate additional export sales and online revenue opportunities, increased market diversification so as to underpin sustainable growth. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I announced a &euro;300m Future Growth Loan Scheme for loans of up to 10 years. The Scheme has been developed by my Department with the European Investment Bank Group, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Finance together with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  This Scheme is crucial as it will provide businesses the opportunity to borrow for up to ten years to support capital investment. It addresses the lack of availability of loans in the marketplace for loan-terms of longer than five-to-seven years. <\/p>  <p>  In April of this year, along with Minister Breen, I met with the Chairs of all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees and other regional stakeholders, to start a process to Refresh and Refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their effectiveness, relevance and impact out to 2020, particularly in light of Brexit. I had a further meeting with the Chairs of the Regional Committees yesterday in my offices and I am pleased with the ambition and quality of the proposals being developed. The refreshed Midlands Region Action Plan for Jobs will enhance the impact and delivery of the supports outlined in Budget 2019, and existing supports, to increase job creation and enterprise development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Balance","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[42698\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the guidance given to agencies under her Department's remit to ensure there is more gender balance in terms of the leadership of the companies and research projects that are funded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>My Department strongly supports gender balance and is represented on the Government's 'Better Balance for Business Review Group'.

The scheme is open to both State Agency clients and businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.

This application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit.

However, the Council also highlighted that Ireland remains a relatively high cost location and cost pressures are evident in residential property, credit, energy, labour and business service costs.  To that end, the range of personal taxation cuts announced in last week&rsquo;s budget will reduce labour cost pressures and be welcomed by enterprise.<\/p>  <p>  A range of initiatives set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 are in train across Government Departments to enhance our cost competitiveness and productivity, improve the ease of doing business, reduce the administrative burden and drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 Renewed - which I launched in March - placed an increased emphasis on enhancing our competitiveness position by developing indigenous enterprises. Budget 2019 contained a number of taxation measures designed to progress that aim.  The extension of the start-up tax relief for new companies, the targeted amendments to the Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) share option scheme and the announcement of a set of priority measures designed to improve the working of the Employment Investment Incentive Scheme (EIIS) are all evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Following the allocation of additional funding for my Department in last week&rsquo;s budget, I announced The Future Growth Loan Scheme, which will provide up to &euro;300m in funding over longer terms, with less onerous conditions and at competitive rates to eligible businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Another measure specifically aimed at boosting productivity was the doubling of the Retail Online Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m which will boost the online presence of our retail sector and allow them to compete in new markets and retain existing business.<\/p>  <p>  The Enterprise development agencies under my remit also play a key role in supporting firms who innovate and increase productivity.

Unemployment has reduced from a high of almost 16% to 5.4% in September 2018, according to the latest monthly unemployment figures from the CSO.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year, my Department published Enterprise 2025 Renewed. This involved reviewing our enterprise policies to ensure that our policy priorities remain robust in today's uncertain environment. The review confirmed the fundamentals of our enterprise policy remain sound, and so, Enterprise 2025 Renewed reaffirms our policy focus on export-led growth, underpinned by innovation, talent and investments in place-making.  <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Review showed that we need to make changes to our policy emphasis, to refocus on building resilience and to accelerate the speed at which we implement change. In the face of global challenges, Enterprise 2025 Renewed places a greater emphasis on five main areas: <\/p>  <p>  - supporting the development of Irish owned enterprises so that they are a driver of growth over the period to 2025; <\/p>  <p>  - placing a spotlight on innovation, skills and on leveraging Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in technologies - the fundamentals that underpin competitiveness and enhanced productivity; <\/p>  <p>  - stimulating greater levels of clustering that takes advantage of the distinctive enterprise mix we have here in Ireland including foreign and Irish owned and optimises spillovers; <\/p>  <p>  - developing Ireland&rsquo;s relationships with new like-minded members within the EU, managing our reputation in the US, as well as more widely; and raising Ireland&rsquo;s visibility in overseas markets where we are less well known; and<\/p>  <p>  - realising the potential of all our regions.<\/p>  <p>  The recent pace of economic growth in Ireland has given rise to certain constraints which we are all aware of. I recognise that there are vulnerabilities within our enterprise base, including concentrations in certain sectors and lower productivity performance in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across the economy. I am aware that skills shortages could constrict growth and that our labour force participation levels for certain cohorts are often lower than other comparable countries. Looking to the longer term, Project Ireland 2040 projects an increase in population of around 1 million people by 2040 requiring 660,000 additional jobs to be created over that period.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I know that Ireland&rsquo;s future economic prospects will be shaped by international developments including Brexit and other global developments. Moreover, technological change will continue to fundamentally alter the types of jobs we will have in the future as well as the types of businesses supporting those jobs.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government have comprehensively developed strategies which address many of these key challenges, we must avoid complacency and prepare for an uncertain future building on the strengths and successes of the Action Plan for Jobs process and Enterprise 2025. We need to be innovative in our approach to effectively tackle long-standing structural issues, to capture new areas of opportunity and to position Ireland for sustainable growth.<\/p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, in July, the Government agreed to an ambitious initiative to guide the next phase of Ireland's economic development - Future Jobs. The initiative will be developed jointly by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach. It will harness the coordinated commitment across many Government Departments and agencies established through previous initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs will emphasise building resilience through improving productivity especially among Irish SMEs; enhancing skills levels and increasing participation in the labour force; preparedness for, and exploitation of, anticipated transformational changes arising from technological developments and the transition to a low carbon and digital based economy. A National Summit will be held in November that will be an opportunity for stakeholders to engage with policy makers and contribute to the development of Future Jobs which will be finalised and published in early 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Research Prioritisation, introduced by Government in 2012 and initially spanning the period to 2017, aligned the majority of competitively awarded public investment in research with 14 priority areas that presented particular market opportunities for Ireland and where there was a pre-existing, proven combination of enterprise relevance and research strength in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Innovation 2020 contained a commitment to review these areas with a view to updating and revising them as appropriate taking into consideration developments since 2012. The &ldquo;Research Priority Areas 2018 to 2023&rdquo; were published earlier this year with revised themes and new opportunities. The revised priority areas will be of particular relevance in the context of the new &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund announced by the Government as part of the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  <\/p>  <p>  This Fund is additional to existing innovation programmes and is about exploiting research to deliver new technologies and new solutions. It is also about incentivising collaborations between companies and collaborations with the colleges and other public sector bodies to deploy this technology in Ireland. There is &euro;180 million of Exchequer funding being allocated to the Fund between now and 2022. When we factor in industry co-funding, this is a sizeable fund and one which is very much needed at this point. We have an budgetary allocation of &euro;20 million in 2019 to fund the initial projects. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that we have a strong basis from which to grow. Using my Department's Budget allocation for 2019 to prioritise funding in the three key areas of Brexit, regional growth and innovation, I am sure that our business community will be best placed to meet the opportunities and challenges ahead. While we cannot control what happens externally, we can ensure that Ireland's future prospects are strengthened by taking the right actions now across Government to ensure that:  Ireland remains internationally competitive; that our enterprises deepen their resilience through investments in skills and innovation; and that we continue to create an environment that is supportive of business investment and growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arms Trade","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[42702\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800062#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of licences for the export of arms or dual-use items that were denied in 2017; and if any of the licences denied were for the export of arms or dual-use items to Saudi Arabia.","asker":"1259","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for controls on the export of military and dual use items from Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Under Irish law, military export licences must be sought in respect of the goods and technology, and any components thereof, listed in the Annex to the Control of Exports (Brokering Activities, Goods and Technology) Order, S.I.

Indeed, enterprise development and job creation in the regions of Ireland is a key policy priority of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Midlands has seen good progress under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, with employment in the region increasing by 14% from Q1 2015 to Q2 2018. There are 15,300 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015 to Q2 2018. Live Register numbers have fallen in all four Midland counties in the past 12 months. In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the Midlands of 6% and 1% respectively. Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have 819 client companies in the Midlands employing 4,214 people; and last year those companies added 387 new employees in total. <\/p>  <p>  CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the Midlands is currently at 9.7% (Q2 2018), which is higher than the State average and continued focus is therefore required on regional enterprise development and job creation in this region.<\/p>  <p>  The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland in every county continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses.<\/p>  <p>  IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019. The IDA is involved in a number of initiatives to attract additional FDI to the Midlands, including a focused digital marketing campaign. This is designed to market the Midlands Region to potential investors by showcasing locations such as Westmeath and Longford. The IDA actively engages with its existing client base to support them in growing their business to retain jobs and expand their existing footprint in the region. The Agency also maintains regular engagement with the Chief Executives of Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly County Councils to attract further investment to the region.<\/p>  <p>  Regional development and growth of indigenous enterprise was one of my three main priorities for Budget 2019, announced last week. In order to support this, I announced the following allocations:<\/p>  <p>  - an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs); <\/p>  <p>  - a doubling Retail Online Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m to strengthen retailers online offering;<\/p>  <p>  - a new round of &euro;175m for Seed and Venture Capital Fund; <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2.75m for SMEs Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters Programme; and <\/p>  <p>  - a &euro;300m Future Growth Loan Scheme which addresses the lack of availability of loans in the marketplace for loan-terms of longer than five to seven years <\/p>  <p>  These initiatives will operate alongside existing supports for businesses and indigenous entrepreneurs. <\/p>  <p>  I also announced an allocation of &euro;10m to the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme. The IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme is critical to encouraging more foreign direct investment into the regions. Project Ireland 2040 names the Border and Midlands regions as priority areas for this Programme, and so the funding will be used to start building advanced facilities a number of regional locations, including Athlone. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that any business can find out more information about the supports available to their business by visiting the SME Online Tool or they can contact their Local Enterprise Office which is the first stop shop for information, support and referral in relation to supports for business in every county.   <\/p>  <p>  The Midlands Action Plan for Jobs has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Midlands, working with public and private stakeholders. In April of this year, I met with the Chairs of all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees and other regional stakeholders, to start a process to Refresh and Refocus all Regional Plans, including the Midlands Plan, to ensure their effectiveness, relevance and impact out to 2020, particularly in light of Brexit. This work is ongoing at present.<\/p>  <p>  In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding. This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years. The Fund supports the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Manufacturing Research CLG project located in Mullingar was one of the significant funding recipients under Stream 1 of the REDF, which will be an important support to manufacturing activity in the Midlands region. In addition, Longford is a partner in a Stream 2 project to develop a network of three Digital and Innovation Hubs with Leitrim and Cavan.<\/p>  <p>  In April of this year I launched a second competitive call under the REDF , which will make available the remainder of the &euro;60 million. The results of this competitive process will be announced by the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  Lastly, there have been a number of recent high-profile investments announced by overseas companies in the Midlands region. Earlier this year, Indian-owned Leetha Industries announced that it is to establish a manufacturing and supply operation called Red Seal Cups Ltd. in Ireland.  This will create over 100 jobs in Longford over the next three years. The Avery Dennison Corporation is also planning a significant expansion of its Finesse Medical manufacturing facility in the county. <\/p>  <p>  I was in Longford last Friday (October 12th) where I officially opened the first Center Parcs recruiting day. Center Parcs will invest in a &euro;233m resort in Longford Forest on a 400-acre site which will create approximately 750 jobs during the construction phase, and is due to open in the summer of 2019.   Once open, the resort expects to employ up to 1,000 people in permanent jobs. <\/p>  <p>  Developments like these are a great vote of confidence in what the Midlands has to offer for investors. My priority is to continue to work with stakeholders collectively within the Midlands to build on the progress to date on implementation of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs over the period to 2020, and to focus on leveraging the key strengths of the region. My Department is also working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to the National Planning Framework and development of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, and with the Department of Rural and Community Development on roll out of the Action Plan for Rural Development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Skills Shortages","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[42561\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if her Department has a long-term plan in place to deal with skills shortages in various sectors; and the timeframe to implement recommendations by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>My Department works in collaboration with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that the education and training system is producing the right talent pool to ensure the success of enterprise in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, my Department provides research and secretarial support to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN). The EGFSN plays a key role in identifying and advising the Government on current and future skills needs, through the undertaking of research, analysis and horizon scanning on current and emerging skills requirements at thematic and sectoral levels. Recently completed and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN includes analyses of skills needs or implications relating to the food and drink sector, design, high level ICT, Brexit\/trade related skills needs, and digitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the National Skills Architecture, the EGFSN presents its findings to the National Skills Council, which is chaired by the Minister for Education and Skills, and includes representation from the chief skills stakeholders within the Irish economy, including my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the Regional Skills Fora, Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, and employment permit trends, the Council works to enhance the response of the education and training system to the provision and delivery of those skills. In considering the recommendations of the EGFSN, the Government and relevant stakeholders are guided by the timeframes advised by the Group in its individual reports.<\/p>  <p>  This National Skills Architecture, underpinned by robust analysis and data collection on skills needs, ensures an education and training system that can be responsive and flexible in meeting the evolving skills needs of the economy, especially under the impact of continuing technological change. <\/p>  <p>  The research of the EGFSN and SLRMU also informs my Department&rsquo;s Economic Migration Policy Unit, which holds responsibility for the employment permits system and manages the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and Ineligible Categories List. <\/p>  <p>  The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill areas of identified skills shortage.

It has also fed into the Action Plan for Jobs, and from 2019, the Future Jobs initiative, which will focus on raising productivity levels across the economy including through ready availability of relevant skills and talent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Supports","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[36140\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she is satisfied that the national research prioritisation exercise allocated sufficient funding and resources to research projects in the discovery and basic oriented research areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>Innovation 2020 contains a commitment to support excellent research across the full continuum from basic research to the creation and development of research-informed innovative products, processes and services.<\/p>  <p>  Government investment in R&amp;D includes funding for programmes that encompass all disciplines and all types of research.

The new Programme will be in place next year and will cover the period to 2024. The Programme will be aimed at seed and early stage investments, where the evaluation has shown there is a very clear market failure.

In 2017 alone, the number of IDA supported jobs in Donegal increased by 11%, with the County now home to 12 IDA companies including SITA, Optibelt and Pramerica.  <\/p><p>With respect to this year, the indications are that FDI in Donegal will continue to increase. For example, Abbott Laboratories has announced plans to expand its workforce in the County with the creation of 500 new jobs. Site visits by IDA client companies have also increased, with three visits as of the second quarter of 2018, compared to a total of two site visits in 2017. <\/p><p>While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in Donegal, the Government remains determined to achieve more.

Following a review of the CGS, a new scheme which incorporates many positive changes, including an increase in the guarantee from 75% to 80% is being rolled out by the banks this year. In the lifetime of the Credit Guarantee Schemes to the end of June 2018, approximately &euro;93.4 million in credit guarantee scheme facilities were sanctioned for 587 SMEs, resulting in 3,666 jobs being created or sustained. <\/p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland (MFI) was established to provide small loans from between &euro;2,000 to &euro;25,000 to start ups and established businesses.  Since its establishment to the end of June 2018 MFI has approved loans totalling &euro;25.4m that have helped to create or sustain 4,277 jobs so far.  <\/p>  <p>  I launched the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme in March 2018 this year. This scheme will be available to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees.  The scheme offers a competitive interest rate of 4% or lower.  Loans will range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million, with a loan term of up to three years.  <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme is currently being developed by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF).  Through a counter-guarantee from the EIF, the Future Growth Loan Scheme will leverage &euro;62 million of Exchequer funding, of which 60% will be provided by my Department and the remaining 40% will be provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine over a five-year period to make a fund of up to &euro;300 million available to eligible Irish businesses for terms of 8-10 years. Finance provided under the scheme will be competitively priced and have favourable terms, including the interest rate, with loans up to &euro;500,000 unsecured.  The scheme is expected to launch in early 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Applications","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB05400"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[42666\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800063#WRB05500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to deal with the average 16 week wait for working permits.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>As the economy improves and we approach full employment my Department has experienced a high volume of employment permit applications in recent months which has led to some delays in processing applications. <\/p><p>At the end of September 2018, the total number of employment permit applications accepted was 12,530, a 29% increase over the same period in 2017.<\/p><p>During this period, the total number of employment permits issued was 9,284 a 10% increase over the same period in 2017.<\/p><p>The Employment Permits section in my Department is working to reduce the current waiting times of six weeks for applications from Trusted Partners who are regular users of the service, and account for 71% of total permits issued, and sixteen weeks for Standard applications, which account for 29% of permits issued. <\/p><p>My officials have been proactively engaging with customers to notify them of current delays through email, meetings and regular updates on the Employment Permits section of my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>In order to reduce processing times, the Employment Permits section has introduced a number of operational changes, streamlined processes and implemented ICT solutions.

Some element of indexation has been built into the ancillary grant and the payment of Minor Works Grant has given schools some flexibility in responding to pressures. <\/p><p>I do plan to move towards multiannual provision in the area of capitation as resources permit to allow schools more certainty for planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800064#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in Schools","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800064#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[42101\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800064#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that adequate steps have been taken to prevent school bullying with particular reference to the use of social media in the classroom or outside and on or off school precincts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>The Action Plan on Bullying published in 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying in schools. These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed.  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, including a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published in September 2013.<\/p>  <p>  These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to all schools to prevent and tackle school-based bullying behaviour and to deal with the negative impact of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Awareness on internet safety for schools is carried out by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST- Technology in Education) in partnership with the Safer Internet Ireland Project. Webwise, an internet safety initiative co-funded by my Department and operated by the PDST Technology in Education, promotes the autonomous, effective, and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting parents, teachers, and children themselves with consistent and relevant messages including guidance on acceptable usage in schools. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2013 a range of new resources have been developed by Webwise  including &ldquo;UP2US&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Selfie and the wider world&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lockers&rdquo;.

My Department is strongly supportive of the promotion of wellbeing in our schools and has a key role to play in the promotion of the wellbeing of children and young people in Ireland, in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs, and with other Government Departments and Agencies.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health.  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.<\/p>  <p>  To support this holistic approach my Department has published a Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2018-2023) for all schools which will inform how schools can best promote student wellbeing.  The policy statement and framework for practice provides an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of Wellbeing Promotion in schools.  <\/p>  <p>  Best practice indicates that schools adopt a whole-school, multi-component preventative approach to Wellbeing Promotion that includes both universal and targeted interventions.  A whole-school approach involves all in the school community engaging in a collaborative process to improve areas of school life that impact on wellbeing.  This will be achieved through the use of a School Self-Evaluation process taking Wellbeing Promotion as its focus.  It will allow schools to benchmark their practice against the statement of effective practice, and identify areas for development, implementation and review.  It is envisaged that schools will engage with the statements and adapt and develop the best practice items as they meet the needs in their own school community.<\/p>  <p>  A multi-component approach encourages schools to address areas, not only relating to Teaching and Learning but also relating to culture and environment, policy and planning and relationships and partnerships.  These areas are embedded in the Wellbeing Framework for Practice.  Working preventatively and providing for both universal and targeted approaches is described as providing a &lsquo;Continuum of Support&rsquo;.  Schools are encouraged to provide supports to promote the wellbeing of all within the school community as well as providing some targeted interventions for children and young people presenting with vulnerabilities in the area of wellbeing.  <\/p>  <p>  It is my Department&rsquo;s aim that by 2023 all schools and centres for education will have embedded this dynamic School Self-evaluation process focusing on Wellbeing Promotion.  The implementation of this Wellbeing Promotion Process is an ongoing process that will ensure the necessary focus on supporting children and young people in having a sense of purpose and fulfilment, and the skills necessary to deal with life&rsquo;s challenges.<\/p>  <p>  A Wellbeing Policy Implementation Plan, which has specified seven high level goals, has been agreed for achievement over the next five years.  The seven high level goals are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  1. Strengthen and align current structures within the Department and between the Department and other relevant Departments to ensure the coordinated implementation of this Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice.<\/p>  <p>  2. Plan and provide for the national roll-out of a professional development process to facilitate all schools and centres for education to engage with and embed a Wellbeing Promotion Process which builds professional capacity and collaborative cultures from 2018-2023.<\/p>  <p>  3. Provide for an aligned, comprehensive and easily-accessible programme of support for all schools and centres for education to address school-identified wellbeing promotion needs.<\/p>  <p>  4. Consider how the system is meeting current and future teachers&rsquo; learning needs relating to wellbeing promotion<\/p>  <p>  5. Develop a research based framework for the evaluation of wellbeing promotion in schools.<\/p>  <p>  6. Improve use of supports for children and young people at key points of transition within and between education settings.<\/p>  <p>  7. Promote the wellbeing of school and centre of education personnel.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will be supported in this work by a national professional development programme currently being developed and trialled, and full roll out will commence in 2019.

My Department is strongly supportive of the promotion of positive mental health awareness in both primary and post-primary schools. The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems including behavioural, emotional and social.<\/p><p><i><\/i>To support this holistic approach my Department has published a Wellbeing Policy and Framework for Practice (2018-2023) for all schools which will inform how schools can promote student wellbeing.  It is the Department&rsquo;s aim that by 2023 all schools and centres for education will have embedded a dynamic Wellbeing Promotion Process<b><i><\/i><\/b>which promotes a whole school preventative approach to the promotion of wellbeing with interventions at both universal and targeted levels. This approach is the most beneficial evidence informed approach for schools in the promotion of mental health and the support for students with mental health difficulties. The Wellbeing Policy includes an Implementation Plan with seven high level actions to support the realisation of the policy.  Actions 2, 3 and 4 below focus on the need for the training of teachers which will include work with schools to ensure those students with most needs, including mental health needs, receive the highest level of support.  It is intended to:<\/p><p>- Plan and provide for the national roll-out of a professional development process to facilitate all schools and centres for education to engage with and embed a Wellbeing<\/p><p>- Promotion Process which builds professional capacity and collaborative cultures in schools from 2018-2023.<\/p><p>- Provide for an aligned, comprehensive and easily-accessible programme of support for all schools and centres for education to address school-identified Wellbeing Promotion Needs.<\/p><p>- Consider how the system is meeting current and future teachers&rsquo; learning needs relating to wellbeing promotion.<\/p><p>Support for implementation of the national Well-Being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013)<i><\/i>is also encompassed within the Wellbeing Policy and Framework for Practice implementation<i>.  <\/i><\/p><p>Responsibility for provision of mental health services and counselling for young people lies with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. Schools are advised to identify supports and services that are available in their community, build relationships and agree referral pathways for students needing referral. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides psychological support and engages in collaborative work helping school staff in how to access appropriate mental health services. Psychologists support schools in connecting with Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health services in relation to individual children and young people with mental health needs. Psychologists support and encourage the establishment of referral and communication protocols between education and health services at local level and work with others to develop community based mental health promotion strategies. <\/p><p>NEPS also provides guidelines and resource materials for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect students and school staff. The guidelines responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools (2016) refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment. It also outlines how schools can plan for crises.  The publication provides support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time with practical step-by-step guidance for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs. The guidelines focus on alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community. In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches.  NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at the schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff and students.<\/p><p>A Wellbeing Steering Committee is overseeing the implementation of the Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice<i><\/i>within my Department. It examines issues in relation to the co-ordination and aligning of the range of supports provided to schools in regard to wellbeing and mental health promotion.  This involves coordinating the liaison with other Departments and Government agencies. <\/p><p>The Policy includes a Wellbeing Implementation Plan and significant resources have been committed from a number of sections of the Department.  NEPS capacity to enhance educational psychological service to schools has been increased through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists in the last academic year and a further 10 psychologists in 2018\/19.  The focus of part of this additional support, in the context of primary schools, is on extending the delivery of training in the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management Programme (IYTCM) and the Friends programmes to teachers in DEIS schools. IYTCM aims to reduce behavioural difficulties and strengthen social and emotional competence in primary school-age children. The Friends Programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in young people thus promoting mental health.  <\/p><p>The Department also works with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the Health Promoting Schools initiative, which is supported by the Health Service Executive. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing on whole-school level conditions that affect health and wellbeing of children and young people. <\/p><p>Finding new ways of tackling policy issues that are not the sole responsibility of any one Government Department or agency has been prioritised by Government. My Department has been involved with the Taskforce on Youth Mental Health as part of the programme for Government.  One of the challenges of providing a coordinated, streamlined approach to mental health promotion is the fact that there are so many statutory and voluntary agencies\/services\/NGOs involved. The Task Force was established to produce a series of action-focused recommendations to improve youth mental health.  The main areas of focus comprised: emotional literacy and reduction of stigma; awareness of services and supports; accessibility to services and supports across different settings; alignment of services and supports across different providers; and building capacity in local communities.  The report has been published and a memorandum has been agreed the Government.<\/p><p>The work of implementing the Taskforce recommendations will be linked with the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project.  Youth mental health and suicide prevention is one of three Pathfinder Projects under Action 5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan (2014) and agreed by the Civil Service Management Board.  This Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project<b><\/b>is an initiative to innovate and improve whole-of-Government working on cross-cutting policy issues and improve the delivery of shared whole-of-Government projects. The aim is to strengthen management and accountability of cross-cutting projects that involve multiple Departments, Offices and Agencies and ensure that policies that are not the priority or responsibility of a single body are effectively managed, supported and resourced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800065#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Eligibility","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800065#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[42041\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800065#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the criteria applied when designating a school for DEIS status; if he will reconsider including a school (details supplied) in the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department introduced an objective, statistics based model for assessing which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS Programme in 2017, so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  This model uses data supplied by schools to my Department's Primary and Post Primary Online Databases and CSO Small Area of Population statistics from the National Census of Population as represented by the Pobal Haase Pratschke Deprivation Index. Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  <\/p>  <p>  DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.

The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, as schools are now front-loaded with additional resources based on the profile of each individual school.  This means that the Department has allocated special education teaching support directly to schools to enable them to respond to pupil needs without having to wait for an assessment to allow them to apply for additional resources.  School can now respond to individual need in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment or a diagnosis of a disability in order to access Special Education Teaching.  It also means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school.  Medical or psychological assessments will still be used to assess a child&rsquo;s needs, or the nature of difficulties they may have. However, an assessment, or diagnosis, will no longer be needed to access additional teaching support in schools. <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s direct question in this matter I am not aware of any particular delay in assessment processes operated by my Department. However the Deputy will be aware that the HSE operates an Assessment of Needs process under the Disability Act 2005 which provides an access route to a number of specialist supports for children.

For example, women are more strongly represented in the financial sector with women representing 43% of participants across the four apprenticeships. Women also feature more strongly in the new hospitality apprenticeships.  With further new programmes to get underway in sectors that would have strong female participation  in the workplace it is expected that the number of female apprentices will continue to rise year on year. <\/p>  <p>  While this is welcome, it is also important to address issues influencing the low level of recruitment of women in the craft sectors.

In response, the Bank has indicated that with the European-wide transition from Solvency I to Solvency II regulatory regime (in place since 1 January 2016), the Central Bank no longer produces the annual Insurance Statistics publication, known as the &lsquo;Blue Book&rsquo;.  The tables in the Blue Book, including the table on liability Irish risk business, were extracted from the Solvency I forms which were completed by the industry and were publicly available (in the Companies Registration Office) and, as these are no longer completed, most of the Blue Book tables cannot be continued in the old format.  Furthermore, the underlying data in the Blue Book is now valued on the Solvency II, as opposed to the Solvency I, basis and many of the time series have been broken. <\/p><p>I appreciate that the discontinuation of the publication of this data may be regrettable to particular interested parties, however I understand that those interested parties seeking data at company level can find such data in publically available reports which are required of all insurance undertakings under the Solvency II regime.  Within this new regulatory regime, the Central Bank has informed me that it has taken steps to improve the transparency of data as follows:<\/p><p>-  Under the new international Solvency II regulation, the Central Bank is now required to publish harmonised aggregate data that is consistent and comparable with other insurance supervisors in the EU.  The first data on the new regime was published in August 2017:  <i>www.centralbank.ie\/regulation\/industry-market-sectors\/insurance-reinsurance\/solvency-ii\/supervisory-disclosure<\/i>.<\/p><p>-  Individual undertakings are required to produce a publically available Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR).  The SFCR includes a detailed narrative report on the insurance undertaking coupled with key quantitative reporting templates that contain premiums, claims, expenses, technical provisions, solvency and other information.  Unlike the Blue Book where the data referenced solely business undertaken in Ireland; the data in the SFCRs are consolidated and include all business undertaken by a firm within Ireland and abroad. All SFCRs for 2016 have been made available by the Central Bank at: <i>www.centralbank.ie\/regulation\/industry-market-sectors\/insurance-reinsurance\/solvency-ii\/solvency-and-financial-condition-report-repository<\/i>.<\/p><p>-  I understand that the Central Bank has now received the second filing of SFCRs for the industry this summer and will update the repository with end-2017 documents between end-October and mid-November and that it is planning to publish a number of summary tables containing data from individual SFCRs to complement the repository and to make the information more easily accessible.<\/p><p>With regard to other points raised by the Deputy, he will be aware that the Central Bank implements its supervisory regime through:<\/p><p>-  processing applications for authorisation, monitoring compliance with prudential standards,<\/p><p>-  developing systems and procedures to monitor activities and detecting non-compliance by firms, <\/p><p>-  issuing guidance notes to enhance supervisory oversight, and<\/p><p>-  supporting the development of domestic legislation and implementing EU regulations. <\/p><p>The Central Bank supervises the insurance sector, including those providing liability insurance as a line of business, under the Solvency II framework.  This has applied to the majority of EU insurance firms since 1 January 2016.  I understand that the Central Bank is satisfied that it receives comprehensive information on all lines of business, including liability insurance, under Solvency II to assist it in regulating the sector.  <\/p><p>Finally, the Central Bank has informed me that, in common with other European regulators, it is not permitted to make this information public, except in very limited circumstances, where firms themselves publish the data in their own public reports (for example, the above-mentioned SFCR)<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800067#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Statistics Office Reports","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800067#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[43072\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800067#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress of the report on the development of the business insurance price index by the CSO as recommended by the Cost of Insurance Working Group; when the report will be published; when such an index will be up and running; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>Increasing the availability of data in relation to Employer and Public Liability Insurance is a matter which was discussed by the Cost of Insurance Working Group and its <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance<\/i>(2018) recommends a number of actions to improve transparency in this area.<\/p><p>Among these, Recommendation 1 requires the Central Statistics Office to consider the feasibility of collecting price information on the cost of insurance to businesses with this exercise to commence by the end of Q2 2018.

However, I recognise that there is a view from some stakeholders that it would be desirable to expand the scope of the database to other lines of business.  For this reason, the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 has been drafted in such a way as to facilitate this expansion at a later stage, should it be considered feasible to collect other types of non-life insurance including employer liability and public liability, in addition to private motor insurance.  The legislation sets out a procedure for this to happen.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Cost of Insurance Working Group did give some consideration to expanding its scope from the outset, however it came quickly to the view that the database project is a complex one with many moving parts. It felt strongly that since we were entering into new territory, it is essential that the motor element of the Database is operating effectively and bedded down properly before consideration is given to expanding it to include other lines of business. The Working Group was also of the view that to expand the scope of the database from the outset would inevitably have implications for the timeline of its commencement.  I therefore believe that the priority now should be to enact the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill as soon as is possible, and I am hopeful that with the cooperation of all parties in the Houses, it can be considered and approved expeditiously in order that the database is in place and operational for the start of next year.<\/p>  <p>  You will also be aware that the Cost of Insurance Working Group in its Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance identified the second half of 2019 as the most appropriate time to expect the Central Bank to have formed a view on the effectiveness of the motor element of the database and to have conducted its analysis on the feasibility and merit of extending it to Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  In the context of a project of this nature, I think this is a reasonable timetable and the Deputy can rest assured that myself and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy will be monitoring this issue very closely, as I agree that if the feasibility of expanding the scope of the database can be established, then the additional information generated should be very helpful in understanding the employer\/public liability claims environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800067#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Liability Insurance","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800067#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[43074\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800067#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the key information report will be published on employer and public liability insurance claims (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>Increasing the availability of data in relation to Employer and Public Liability Insurance is a matter which was discussed by the Cost of Insurance Working Group and its <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance<\/i>(2018) recommends a number of actions to improve transparency in this area. <\/p><p>Among these, recommendation 4 tasks the Department of Finance, through the data sub-group, to make a request to Insurance Ireland for similar key metrics which were requested in relation to the Motor Insurance Key Information Reports, and to produce a report by the end of 2018.  <\/p><p>I am informed that the data sub-group developed the relevant template for a request to Insurance Ireland for certain key metrics to enable a report to be produced and published in Q4 2018.

The reason for the request for the data submission to be provided by the end of Q3 was to allow sufficient time in Q4 for the data sub-group to collate and analyse the submission, draft the report, and then publish the Key Information Report on employer liability and public liability insurance.  <\/p><p>My officials have informed me that Insurance Ireland has not yet submitted this data.  Consequently, they sought an update as to when this will happen.

This has been completed and they are liaising with their members and expect to start the data gathering process shortly.  For this reason, they have indicated that it will not be possible for them to submit the market data within the required timeframe. However they have made it very clear that they remain committed to expediting this request.  They have noted that the request involves the collection of detailed information across a number of reporting, calendar and accident years, broken down between employer liability and public liability insurance, in addition to public liability insurance being broken down further between injury and property claims, and that such data has never been collected to this level of detail before.  <\/p><p>The above means therefore that it will not be possible for my Department to produce and publish this Report by the end of this year.

The language of instruction of a proposed new school is an integral part of the patronage assessment and recommendation process.  It is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons, including patrons involved in Irish-medium provision and indeed any prospective patron which wishes to provide Irish-medium education, to apply for patronage of a new school under the patronage process.  Parental preferences for each patron and their separate preference in relation to the language of instruction of the school, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  The assessment process includes an analysis of the extent of diversity including language, already available in an area and in the adjacent school planning areas.<\/p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for my consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website www.education.ie.<\/p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and their preferred language medium for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) opened in June 2018 for the four post-primary schools to be established in 2019. The Patronage Process for the primary schools to be established in 2019 will commence later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process is aimed at accelerating the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools towards the Government target of reaching 400 such schools by 2030. The new plans are designed to provide multi-\/non-denominational schools by way of patronage transfer of existing schools.  An opportunity is available to English-medium schools seeking to make a transition to Gaelscoil provision in that context, in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800069#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Services Staff","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800069#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[42796\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800069#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to outline his views on the fact that non-departmental school clerical staff are on inferior contracts and will receive no pension compared to departmental secretaries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>Though schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in primary and secondary schools, where staff employed on these schemes are paid directly by the Department, these schemes have been largely phased out and have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Under these schemes, the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services. Within the schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently made significant efforts to improve the pay of school secretaries who are employed using capitation grant assistance, however. In 2015 my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries on negotiations and agreed to enter an independent arbitration process on the issue.

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  <\/p>  <p>  The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined.  It is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides. Therefore it is important to understand that the demographic of neighbouring schools will not necessarily be the same and can indicate different levels of disadvantage based on the actual pupil cohort in each individual school. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie\/en\/Schools-Colleges\/Services\/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-\/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.<\/p>  <p>  In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, it has been decided to conduct further quality assurance on the model before extending these envisaged uses of the model. Consequently, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800070#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800070#WRJ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[43148\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800070#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason there is no replacement teacher in a school (details supplied); and if it is a Departmental issue or a school level issue.","asker":"1306","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>Teacher allocations to all schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.

This information has been received and is included in the substantive response below.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Units and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Domestic Abuse Intervention Policy 2017 was developed in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions and incorporates changes in legislation, developments arising from the Cosc National Strategies on the prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence and to comply with the Istanbul Convention and the EU Victims Directive. The theme running though the policy is the provision by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of information, support and protection to victims. The policy document on domestic abuse identifies the nature of intervention that personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are required to make when responding to domestic abuse related incidents. The policy incorporates Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na standards, procedures, relevant legislation and victim support information relevant to domestic abuse related incidents.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that under the policy victims of domestic abuse are provided with the information, support and protection in accordance with the Garda Victim Service Policy and EU Victims Directive. The victim is provided with a copy of the relevant domestic abuse information literature and is made aware of the relevant services, both statutory and voluntary, in the area which may be of assistance to them. I am informed that each Garda Division has a nominated Inspector, who has responsibility for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the domestic abuse intervention policy when dealing with incidents of domestic abuse.<\/p>  <p>  The Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 envisages a range of actions to be implemented by State, voluntary and community sector organisations aimed at preventing and responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting this strategy, and in March 2015 a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences to form the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB) led by a Chief Superintendent. <\/p>  <p>  The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking, domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly. In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) are to be established in every Garda Division with specially trained staff on a phased basis. I am advised by the Commissioner that Phase 1 involved the establishment of Units in three Divisions the Dublin Metropolitan Region West, Cork City, and the Louth Division over a 12-month period on a pilot basis. These units mirror the responsibilities held by the GNPSB and ensure a consistent approach to domestic abuse and sexual crime. The PSUs work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that all Garda personnel receive training in the investigation of incidents considered domestic abuse, in all its forms, with additional training provided to Garda&iacute; selected for duties as detectives.

An application for discharge from wardship is based on medical evidence.  The Courts Service has advised that the current procedure for a person to be released from wardship is as follows: <\/p>  <p>  -  If a person wishes to leave wardship the application is usually made on his\/her behalf by his\/her committee. However, if the person applies directly to the Wards of Court Office that office will correspond directly with that person. A letter is sufficient to commence the process. <\/p>  <p>  -  A report from a medical practitioner saying that the ward is capable of managing his\/her property and person must be lodged. The Wards of Court Office will then ask a court medical visitor to attend the ward and to provide a report for the benefit of the court. If that report also confirms that the ward has capacity, the matter is listed before the President of the High Court at the next available wards of court motion list, which is usually on Mondays during the legal term.<\/p>  <p>  -  If the President of the High Court is satisfied with the medical evidence, an order is made discharging the person from wardship and remitting him\/her control of his\/her assets.<\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that the process can be completed in a matter of weeks, depending on the time taken to procure the medical reports. However, if there is an urgency to the application it will be prioritised by the Wards of Court Office.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the legislation governing persons who are wards of court dates back to 1871 and it has been recognised that reforms were needed to update the law in this area. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The proposed new system will replace the adult wards of court system by a less intrusive system by offering a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability.<\/p>  <p>  Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides for the phased transition from adult wardship to the new support framework. It provides for the review by the wardship court of the capacity of all current adult wards within three years of the commencement of that Part of the Act. Following a review of his or her capacity, the ward will be discharged from wardship and depending on the outcome of the review the wardship court may: <\/p>  <p>  -  Declare that the ward does not lack capacity and immediately discharge the ward from wardship and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him\/her.<\/p>  <p>  -  Declare that the ward lacks capacity unless a suitable person is made available as co-decision maker to make one or more decisions. Once a co-decision making agreement is registered the court shall immediately discharge the ward from wardship and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him\/her. If there is no suitable person to act as co-decision maker or the co-decision making agreement has not been properly registered within a period set down by the court, then the court shall make orders as appropriate under Part 5 to appoint a decision making representative and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him\/her once a decision making representative has been appointed.<\/p>  <p>  -  Declare that the ward lacks capacity even if a suitable person is made available as co-decision maker to make one or more decisions. The court shall make orders as appropriate under Part 5 to appoint a decision making representative and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him\/her once a decision making representative has been appointed.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act provides for the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission. New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.  <\/p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for commencement orders for the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. The Director is working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible. The prevailing view is that the Decision Support Service will be operational by early 2020. As time goes on, every effort will be made to achieve tightening of the timeframes where possible and the situation will continue to be monitored closely by the Steering Group. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800071#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Reunification Applications","counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800071#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":389,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[43014\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800071#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the correct procedure to be followed in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":390,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that it is open to any visa required national to apply for a visa for any purpose.

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans, including the Border region, is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.<\/p><p>We are well on the way to meeting this target. Progress across the eight regions has been very positive since the launch of the initiative, with an increase in employment of 146,400 people in employment Q1 2015 to Q2 2018 in the regions outside of Dublin and 240,600 additional jobs nationwide.<\/p><p>4,400 more people are in employment in the Border region from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2018 (<i>please note that in the CSO&rsquo;s revised regional groupings, Louth is no longer included in data for the Border region. Please see end of note for more details<\/i>)*. <\/p><p>The Border has a Q2 2018 unemployment rate of 6.5% which currently meets the target of being within one percentage point of the national average (Q2 2018). <\/p><p>There is always room for improvement and I am working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the North-East, including in Cavan. The Enterprise Agencies under my remit will continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for this region.<\/p><p>The North-East\/North-West Action Plan for Jobs has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region, working with public and private stakeholders. In April of this year, I met with the Chairs of all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees and other regional stakeholders, to start a process to Refresh and Refocus all Regional Plans, to ensure their effectiveness, relevance and impact out to 2020, particularly in light of Brexit. <\/p><p>The North-East will have a stand-alone plan for this iteration, in which Cavan will form part of alongside Monaghan and Louth. This work is ongoing at present.<\/p><p>In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding. This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. The Fund supports the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.<\/p><p>Three projects from the Border region were successful under Call 1 of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund including a network of three Digital and Innovation Hubs with one hub each in Cavan, Leitrim and Longford. <\/p><p>In April of this year I launched a second competitive call under the REDF, which will make available the remainder of the &euro;60 million. The results of this competitive process will be announced by the end of the year. <\/p><p>IDA Ireland continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in all regions, including in Cavan. There are over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin, with 45% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) jobs created last year based in regional locations.<\/p><p>Last year, IDA client companies conducted two site visits to County Cavan and one site visit as of the second quarter of 2018. Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. <\/p><p>IDA Ireland is working hard to promote County Cavan to potential investors. The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East\/North West Region and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area, it is focusing on sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. <\/p><p>The IDA also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. IDA Ireland also owns sites in Cavan that are being actively marketed to its clients.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across this country. <\/p><p>I am pleased to report that Enterprise Ireland (EI) supported companies employed 5,451 people in Cavan in 2017.  This is an increase of 5% compared to 2016. Overall in the North-East, in 2017, 16,938 were employed in EI client companies. <\/p><p>The LEO in Cavan is the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone intending to start or grow their own business in the area.<\/p><p>In 2017 there were 1,252 people employed in LEO client companies in Cavan. LEO client companies in the county created 207 new jobs with a net increase of 100 jobs. The LEO will continue to support and promote micro-enterprises throughout the county. <\/p><p>The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants; Priming Grants and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand. In addition, there is a Technical Assistance Grant available for eligible micro-exporter applicants who are seeking to explore alternative markets for their product or service. <\/p><p>For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, LEO Cavan may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); a mentor to work with the business proposer; or targeted programmes such as Lean for Micro (to help boost business productivity and competitiveness). <\/p><p>In addition to direct financial and soft supports, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.<\/p><p>*Due to regulation changes, the &lsquo;NUTS3&rsquo; regional groupings (used by the CSO to compose regional employment data) have recently been updated. Under the new groupings, County Louth has moved from the Border to the Mid-East region. From Q1 2018, CSO Labour Force Survey data has been updated to take account of these changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[42984\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the specific supports available to support small and medium enterprises that face particular difficulties due to Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>My Department and its agencies are central to the Government effort to prepare Irish SMEs and our wider business ecosystem for Brexit.

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus of the work of my Department and wider Government policy and is particularly vital in light of the challenges posed by Brexit. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness performance remains positive. The Institute for Management Development shows that Ireland is the 12th most competitive economy in the world and the 3rd most competitive economy in the euro area. The 2018 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum on 17 October shows Ireland is holding its 23rd position in the Global Competitiveness Index and continues to be the 8th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 11th most competitive economy in the EU28. The Report shows a range of strengths &ndash;Ireland is ranked in the top 15 in relation to Cost of Starting a Business (4), Attitudes toward entrepreneurial risk (11) and Growth of innovative companies (14). Furthermore, Ireland scores 99.4 out of 100 in terms of macroeconomic stability. It is an important signal to international investors. <\/p><p>Most importantly, our improved competitiveness is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions. The strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended and reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland. <\/p><p>Recent reports by the National Competitiveness Council have highlighted the need to continually enhance competitiveness performance. I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to further improve competitiveness we must preserve fiscal sustainability, maximise investment in infrastructure and talent, maintain cost competitiveness, and drive innovation and productivity across all economic sectors. Global uncertainty, and Brexit in particular, has underlined the importance of building competitive advantage, generating an uplift in enterprise export competitiveness and continuing to harness the benefits from trade and the Single Market to secure sustainable jobs and growth. My objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and enterprise level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made.<\/p><p>Competitiveness is key to success in international markets and helping businesses to improve their competitiveness will remain a key focus for my Department. We are driving the implementation of our research strategy, Innovation 2020. We are putting more people on the ground in foreign markets to attract investment and helping Irish businesses which export to the UK and helping others diversify into new products and markets.

The &euro;300m long-term Loan Scheme<b><\/b>will provide businesses the opportunity to borrow for up to ten years to support capital investment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02450"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[43041\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to encourage start-up enterprises in all regions throughout the country; the issues identified to date as being likely to impede progress; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":495,"content":"<p>I am committed to the development of a business environment that is encouraging of entrepreneurs in every region of the country. My Department launched the National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship (NPSE) in 2014. It set out the Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives as a facilitator within the Irish entrepreneurship ecosystem. Its ambition is to double the jobs impact of start-ups on the Irish economy over the 5 years by:<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the number of start-ups by 25% (3,000 more start-ups per annum)<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the survival rate in the first five years by 25% (1,800 more survivors per annum), and <\/p>  <p>  - Improving the capacity of start-ups to grow to scale by 25%.<\/p>  <p>  The NPSE is a means for facilitating the entrepreneurs of Ireland in creating, surviving and growing their businesses after a period of huge upheaval in terms of the economy and in new technologies and disruptive business models. Irish entrepreneurs, as ever, have shown resilience, innovation and the willingness to take risks which has seen the rapid increase in the number of business births but also a reduction in the rates of business deaths. For example the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office Business Demography report 2016 indicates there were 19,249 new enterprise births in 2016, up from 16,256 in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Marking the half way point of the Statement, 2017 saw the development and organisation of the Mid-term Review. My Department held a number of stakeholder meetings grouped by those involved in education; state bodies and entrepreneurs themselves. Areas identified for improvement included access to finance, availability of skilled workers and the need to increase the number of female business owners. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the findings of the Mid-term Review and ongoing policy development within my Department, I decided to develop an SME and entrepreneurship strategy for Ireland. It was decided that a review of SME and Entrepreneurship Issues and Policies in Ireland would be undertaken in conjunction with the OECD to support the development of a strategy for SMEs. We have ensured that the review will have a strong regional focus. The review commenced in 2018 and the process will take 18 months to complete. <\/p>  <p>  The key review objectives are to provide an assessment of current SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, strengthen policy design and implementation through recommendations and dialogue stimulation, including through a policy roadmap, and provide international comparison of successful SME and entrepreneurship policies. With this roadmap, I will develop an SME and entrepreneurship strategy to ensure Ireland remains a good place to start a business and strengthens the business environment to ensure more indigenous business throughout the regions can start, grow and internationalise.   <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these policy initiatives, there are currently many supports available to encourage startups throughout every region in the country. The 31 Local Enterprises Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone intending to start or grow their own business.  <\/p>  <p>  Elsewhere, last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding. This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totaling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. The Fund supports the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJ). I have asked the RAPJ Implementation Committees in each region to lead a process to Refresh and Refocus their Plans to 2020. They will define between five and ten clearly defined regional enterprise development objectives with job creation potential, together with measurable time-bound actions to deliver over the next two years. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, I and my Department continue to develop and deliver supports which encourage startups in every region and county of Ireland. We are in frequent consultation with entrepreneurs and are listening to their concerns and making every effort to address these concerns. Ireland is a good country in which to start a business. I have every intention of making it even better. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Supports","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02700"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[43042\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which innovation continues to be a feature of enterprise and investment here; if she remains satisfied that new enterprises have adequate access to innovation technology and-or appropriate assistance from the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[43045\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02850","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which small and medium enterprises can qualify for support in the context of innovation and technology; the extent to which an advantage is afforded to FDI as opposed to the indigenous sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[43046\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02875","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the way in which Ireland compares with other EU and non-EU member states, including the UK, in terms of an attractive location for business and enterprise to locate and avail of innovation and technology; if there are particular areas needing attention in this regard particularly after Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188, 191 and 192 together.<\/p><p>Innovation 2020, Ireland's strategy for research and development, science and technology, was launched in December 2015 and articulates Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to become a Global Innovation Leader. The strategy aims to build on the significant successes which have seen Ireland dramatically improve its innovation performance globally.<\/p><p>Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) is globally recognised as the key economic differentiator and, as such, a very important feature of enterprise and investment in Ireland. Put simply, RDI enables Irish companies to make products and services that are innovative, competitive and more novel than those in global markets.<\/p><p>Earlier this year my Department launched a &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund under the National Development Plan, with an initial exchequer allocation of &euro;180 million to 2022. The Fund is competitive and is seeking investment in the research, development and deployment of disruptive technologies and applications on a commercial basis. It will drive collaboration between Ireland&rsquo;s world-class research base and industry as well as facilitating enterprises to compete directly for funding in support of the development and adoption of these technologies. Collaboration with an SME was an essential requirement in order to be eligible for funding under Call 1 of the Fund.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) and IDA Ireland are both agencies of my Department and each has a specific and very different role to play in the context of innovation and technology. EI is primarily focused on SMEs and indigenous enterprises, while IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main objective is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign owned companies, in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI).<\/p><p>RDI enables Irish companies to make innovative products and services that are competitive and more novel than those in global markets. However, for an SME investment in RDI can be costly in terms of time, personnel and budget. It also requires a focus beyond the day to day challenges of running a business with limited resources. <\/p><p>EI has role in this regard to de-risk such RDI so that companies will develop new and improved products and services and achieve the required exports to allow economic growth. This is done either by supporting companies to do RDI within the company, or by collaborating with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) or by sourcing \/ licencing new technologies from HEIs which can provide a step change in their innovative capabilities. These supports all help companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth.<\/p><p>SMEs qualify for all of EI&rsquo;s funding programmes and a limited number of these programmes are also open to FDI companies. These supports all help companies develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth and are detailed below:  <\/p><p>- In-Company RDI - supporting the development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes which will have a competitive advantage in their target market. This enables companies to increase employment through sustainable and substantially increased sales;<\/p><p>- The Agile Innovation Fund was launched in Quarter 4 2017 and is already gaining huge interest from companies. This Fund allows up to 50% in support for projects to a maximum total cost of &euro;300,000 and has fast track approval;<\/p><p>- Innovation Vouchers - providing vouchers worth &euro;5,000 aims to introduce them to innovation, linking them with a network of knowledge providers, North and South of the border;<\/p><p>- Innovation Partnerships - helping industry to engage in collaborative research projects with Irish universities and Institutes of Technology to develop new products and services;<\/p><p>- Technology Gateways - providing Business Development resources to the Institutes of Technology and other firms to help them interact with industry on a local, regional and national basis;<\/p><p>- Technology Centres - Technology Centres, a partnership between EI and IDA Ireland, are organised to respond rapidly to industry defined needs and conduct market-relevant RDI in partnership with collaborating groups of companies. Participating companies propose areas and themes of greatest relevance to them over a 3-5 year period. In response, the researchers develop solutions that respond to these needs, often exploring avenues that can lead to new licensable intellectual property;<\/p><p>- Campus Incubators &ndash; such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology-intensive start-ups. Incubators now exist on every university and Institute of technology Campus in the country.;<\/p><p>- The Business Innovation Initiative (BII) is aimed at driving innovation beyond selling products based on technical innovations; in turn providing more customer focussed process and service solutions;<\/p><p>- The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Initiative is a cross-government process that allows public bodies to use public procurement to source RDI and innovative solutions to solve &lsquo;identified challenges&rsquo; with solutions that are not currently commercially available. This provides significant business opportunities for innovation focused companies.<\/p><p>High Potential Start Up (HPSU) support is EI&rsquo;s most significant and relevant support available for new start-ups. HPSUs are start-up businesses with the potential to develop an innovative product or service for sale on international markets and the potential to create 10 jobs and &euro;1m in sales within 3 to 4 years of starting up. A range of supports are available under the HPSU offer such as the: <\/p><p>- Innovative HPSU Fund - providing support to early stage companies considered to have an innovative product, service or technology with the potential to achieve international sales and create employment. It is an equity investment into HPSU clients on a co-funded basis to support the company&rsquo;s business plan. This offer also leverages private investments to help the company grow and succeed in the implementation of their business plans;<\/p><p>- New Frontiers Programme - a national entrepreneur development programme delivered locally through the Institutes of Technology (IoTs) and funded by EI. <\/p><p>- Competitive Start Fund (CSF) &ndash; aimed at accelerating the growth of start-up companies that have the capability to become HPSU companies.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland also has an important role to play in the Irish economy, as FDI has been, and will continue to be, a key plank upon which Ireland&rsquo;s economy is built. Its contribution is far reaching and it is estimated that 20% of all private sector employment in the State is directly or indirectly attributable to FDI. It also contributes significant taxation revenue to the Exchequer, generates other commercial activity across the economy and helps to drive investment in research and innovation.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland also has an important role to play in the Irish economy, as FDI has been, and will continue to be, a key plank upon which Ireland&rsquo;s economy is built. Its contribution is far reaching and it is estimated that 20% of all private sector employment in the State is directly or indirectly attributable to FDI. It also contributes significant taxation revenue to the Exchequer, generates other commercial activity across the economy and helps to drive investment in research and innovation.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland is tasked with growing and sustaining FDI in Ireland. It achieves this by partnering with potential and existing investors to help them establish or expand operations here. It also provides a range of supports, including RDI grant assistance, to its client companies.<\/p><p>The four main types of grant offered by IDA Ireland to its clients are: <\/p><p>- Employment Grants are a fixed sum payable on the creation of each agreed job;<\/p><p>- Fixed Asset (capital) grants are payable as a percentage of expenditure incurred by the grantee on the purchase of fixed assets and can be related to the number of jobs created and maintained;<\/p><p>- Research and Development grants are payable as a contribution towards the cost of RDI undertaken by the grantee company;<\/p><p>- Training Grants<b><\/b>are paid in certain cases to enable necessary skills to be learned.<\/p><p>The agency can also make available specific grants or a combination of grants which will frequently be calculated as an overall amount of grant per job, based on the number of jobs to be created by the grant-aided project.<\/p><p>Competition for global FDI has become increasingly intense. Nevertheless, multinational companies continue to invest and re-invest here with leading global firms from many sectors - including life sciences, ICT, engineering and digital media - all based in Ireland. The contribution that these investments make to our wider economy is undoubtedly significant and the Government is working hard to ensure that the country remains a destination of choice for overseas firms. <\/p><p>Ireland's strengths when it comes to attracting FDI are well-documented. These include our competitiveness, talented and productive workforce, favourable demographics and membership of the European Union. Our pro-enterprise business environment, and track record as a home to FDI, are also key factors. Reinforcing and sustaining these strengths is important to ensuring Ireland's continuing FDI competitiveness.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland's 2017 Annual Results provides evidence of our continuing capacity to attract FDI to Ireland. Total employment by overseas companies in Ireland has now surpassed 210,000 people - a record level - with the numbers of investments also increasing. IDA Ireland is also attracting more investment to the regions.<\/p><p>EI and IDA Ireland are resourced to meet the innovation needs of their respective client companies through the range of supports outlined above. SMEs do not compete with FDI projects in order to access supports and no advantage is afforded to foreign-owned companies in terms of the supports available for innovation. <\/p><p>Benchmarking Ireland&rsquo;s performance against other comparable economies is a key tool to enable the delivery of that ambition and to enable us to develop steps to improve our comparative performance. In this year&rsquo;s publication of the European Innovation Scoreboard 2018, Ireland remains in the category of &ldquo;Strong Innovator&rdquo; and has moved up a place to 9th in the EU. Ireland is placed first in three out of the ten dimensions considered - innovative SMEs, employment in knowledge-intensive activities and sales due to innovation activities. Ireland has also retained 10th place in the Global Innovation Index, out of 126 countries assessed. According to IBM Global Location Trends 2018, Ireland remains the number one destination for value for money from foreign direct investment.<\/p><p>The news that Ireland has fallen from 6th to 12th in the Institute of Management Development (IMD) world competitiveness rankings publication is disappointing. The National Competitiveness Council and my officials are reviewing the findings in detail to establish what actions we can take to further improve our competitiveness. However, I would note that despite the change in our ranking, we are the 3rd most competitive economy in the Euro area.  This is still a significant achievement especially when you consider that the UK is ranked 20th.<\/p><p>It is also important to remember that a real indication of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is our ongoing strong employment growth across sectors and regions. In this regard, the impressive performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended. <\/p><p>As is recognised by the IMD, many of Ireland&rsquo;s traditional assets remain highly rated &ndash; in particular, our tax regime, high educational level, skilled workforce, business friendly environment and dynamic economy are all considered very attractive by business.<\/p><p>Further improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance is a key priority for the Government.  We are working hard to consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths in terms of talent, productivity and export competitiveness and to address those areas where we lag behind other countries, particularly in relation to infrastructure.<\/p><p>Assistance from the European Union continues to play a vital role in supporting innovation in enterprises operating in Ireland, both indigenous SMEs and foreign-owned multinational companies.<\/p><p>EI also has supports in place to help companies maximise the funding they can receive from the European Union.<\/p><p>Horizon 2020 is the instrument which supports collaborative R&amp;amp;D in Europe and provides an important source of non-exchequer funding for companies. It enables us to amplify the impact of domestic public investment by leveraging complementary funding from the EU.<\/p><p>Horizon 2020 has a budget of &euro;75 billion and runs from 2014 to 2020. A budget of &euro;30 billion has been allocated to the final three years of Horizon 2020, which will provide significant funding opportunities for companies in Ireland that participate in the programme over the period 2018-2020. Ireland has won &euro;611 million from 2014 to August 2018 in competitive, EU funding from Horizon 2020. Higher Education Institutions accounted for &euro;317.4 million of the total and companies, &euro;232.8 million. The funding for companies included &euro;158.8 million awarded to SMEs.<\/p><p>Under Horizon 2020, the SME Instrument is available and is specifically targeted at single or groups of highly innovative SMEs with international ambitions, determined to turn strong, innovative business ideas into winners on the market. The instrument provides full-cycle business innovation support from the stage of business idea conception and planning over business plan execution and demonstration to commercialisation. Ireland has the highest success rate in Europe for the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument with a 13% success rate, compared to a European average of 5.5%.<\/p><p>In light of Brexit, Irish companies will continue to focus more RDI in a bid to protect their current exports to the UK. Innovation will continue to play a central role in growing exports as well as contributing to employment and EI will assist SMEs in this regard. This continued innovation helps to insulate us from market shocks, such as those posed by Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN03000"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[43043\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which all enterprises existing and-or new, FDI or indigenous, continue to be screened to ensure a smooth and unimpeded operation of their enterprise and the elimination of administrative obstacles; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>Ireland remains a global leader in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).

While recent studies report that Irish businesses are investing less than their EU counterparts several possible barriers to this investment have been highlighted, including the cost of borrowing.<\/p><p>The ESRI study Measuring the Investment Gap and its financing requirement for Irish SMES found that businesses are investing about a third less than would be expected based on fundamental factors. This study is consistent with the findings of several domestic and European surveys that point to underinvestment by Irish businesses. The EIB Group Survey on Investment and Investment Finance 2017 highlighted that Irish businesses reported a higher investment gap than their EU counterparts - 19% versus the EU average of 15%. The SME Brexit Impacts Studyconducted in September 2017 found that 48% of businesses are not investing currently and that 55% did not plan on investing in the following 18 months.<\/p><p>The ESRI\/Department of Finance Study, Exploring SME Investment Patterns in Ireland: New Survey Evidence, published in September 2018 reported that more than two thirds of SMES in the sample reported that they were satisfied with their investment levels or with their current capacity.  The main stated reasons for not having sought credit in the past six months are dominated by a simple lack of credit requirements, a reason cited by 89% of businesses not seeking credit.  <\/p><p>Irish firms fund a high share of investment using internal funds. The EIBIS Survey 2017 indicates that 75% of investment by Irish companies is financed using own funds, substantially above the EU average of 60%.  This reliance on own funds for investment limits the size and timeliness of investment. It also means that a business is not establishing a credit track record which would support future access to finance.<\/p><p>Consequently, the level of demand for credit among Irish SMEs is lower than the EU average. The European Central Bank SAFE study shows that the loan and overdraft application rates in Ireland are considerably lower than euro area averages and that lending expressed as a proportion of domestic demand is also significantly below European norms.  However, the Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey in July this year shows that credit demand is increasing with 26% having applied for bank finance in the first 6 months of 2018 compared to 20% in 2017.<\/p><p>The cost of borrowing for Irish SMEs is higher than the European average and this is a barrier to investment for some SMEs.  The ECB SAFE study reports that interest rates on new NFC loans below &euro;0.25 million (proxy for SME lending) in Ireland are substantially above euro area averages.  One explanation for the interest rate differential is that the SME lending market in Ireland continues to be highly concentrated. According to the latest Central Bank SME Market Report the combined market share of new lending of the three main banks was 82%.<\/p><p>It is in this context that my Department has developed some important SME-specific initiatives to improve availability of affordable finance for SMEs.  A revised Credit Guarantee Scheme<b><\/b>was launched in July 2018 and is providing new financial products and loans other than traditional bank loans and involving other financial providers (beyond the three main banks) for Irish SMEs.  The Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme was launched in March this year.  It provides affordable financing (maximum interest rate of 4%) to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme was introduced in 2012 and is administered by MicroFinance Ireland.  The purpose of the Fund is to provide loans of &euro;2,000 up to &euro;25,000 to Micro-enterprises who cannot obtain funding through traditional sources. <\/p><p>As aprt of Budget 2019 I announced a new longer term Brexit loan scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, which<b><\/b>is being developed by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF).

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus of the work of my Department and wider Government policy and is particularly vital in light of the challenges posed by Brexit. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness performance remains positive. The Institute for Management Development shows that Ireland is the 12th most competitive economy in the world and the 3rd most competitive economy in the euro area. The 2018 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum on 17 October shows Ireland is holding its 23rd position in the Global Competitiveness Index and continues to be the 8th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 11th most competitive economy in the EU28. The Report shows a range of strengths &ndash; Ireland is ranked in the top 15 in relation to the Cost of Starting a Business (4), Attitudes toward entrepreneurial risk (11) and Growth of innovative companies (14). Furthermore, Ireland scores 99.4 out of 100 in terms of Macroeconomic stability. It is an important signal to international investors. However, we are ranked low on Market size (44), our Financial system (37) and Infrastructure (34). The National Development Plan outlines the areas where the Government will substantially increase future capital investment in infrastructure and help further improve our competitiveness. <\/p><p>Most importantly, our improved competitiveness is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions. The strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended and reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland. <\/p><p>Recent reports by the National Competitiveness Council have highlighted the need to continually enhance competitiveness performance. I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to further improve competitiveness we must preserve fiscal sustainability, maximise investment in infrastructure and talent, maintain cost competitiveness, and drive innovation and productivity across all economic sectors. Global uncertainty, and Brexit in particular, has underlined the importance of building competitive advantage, generating an uplift in enterprise export competitiveness and continuing to harness the benefits from trade and the Single Market to secure sustainable jobs and growth. My objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and enterprise level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made. <\/p><p>My Department is driving the implementation of our research strategy, Innovation 2020. We are putting more people on the ground in foreign markets to attract investment and helping Irish businesses which export to the UK and helping others diversify into new products and markets. I launched the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme in March 2018 this year. This scheme supports the working capital needs of companies impacted by Brexit and will be available for two years to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees.  In addition, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) are developing the Future Growth Loan Scheme as announced in Budget 2019.  The &euro;300m long-term Loan Scheme<b><\/b>will provide businesses the opportunity to borrow for up to ten years to support capital investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development Initiatives","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN04050"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[43049\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800074#WRN04100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which emphasis is placed on facilitating and encouraging employment generating enterprises throughout the regions with particular reference to the need to ensure an even spread of investment with consequent benefit to the national economy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made regional development my top priority.

Progress across the eight regions has been very positive since the launch of the initiative, with an increase in employment of 146,400 people in employment Q1 2015 to Q2 2018 in the regions outside of Dublin and 240,600 additional jobs nationwide.<\/p><p>Numbers employed across the State increased by 74,100 over the year to Q2 2018.

The refreshed Plans are targeted for completion by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding. This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. The Fund supports the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.<\/p><p>In April of this year I launched a second competitive call under the REDF in March this year, which will make available the remainder of the &euro;60 million. The results of this competitive process will be announced by the end of the year.<\/p><p>The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions.<\/p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland in every county continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses.<\/p><p>IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019. <\/p><p>Regional development and growth of indigenous enterprise was one of my three main priorities for Budget 2019, announced last week. In order to support this, I announced the following allocations:<\/p><p>-  an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs);<\/p><p>-  a doubling Retail Online Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m to strengthen retailers online offering;<\/p><p>-  a new round of &euro;175m for Seed and Venture Capital Fund;<\/p><p>-  &euro;2.75m for SMEs Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters Programme; and<\/p><p>-  a &euro;300m Brexit Future Growth Loan Scheme which addresses the lack of availability of loans in the marketplace for loan-terms of longer than five to seven years <\/p><p>These initiatives will operate alongside existing supports for businesses and indigenous entrepreneurs. <\/p><p>It is important to reiterate that any business can find out more information about the supports available to their business by visiting the SME Online Tool or they can contact their Local Enterprise Office which is the first stop shop for information, support and referral in relation to supports for business in every county.<\/p><p>My priority is to continue to work with stakeholders collectively across the Regions to build on the progress to date on implementation of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs over the period to 2020, and to focus on leveraging the key strengths in each region.

At my request, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is preparing a report which will make recommendations in relation to the clinical and technical issues involved. I am informed that the CMO&rsquo;s Report is anticipated to be completed in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Pending finalisation of the CMO's report, a number of significant system actions in relation to mesh implants have already been advanced on foot of priority recommendations which were identified in the course of preparation of that report.<\/p>  <p>  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the Health Service Executive on 20 July 2018 to request that the Executive put immediate measures in place to:<\/p>  <p>1. Pause the use of all procedures involving uro-gynaecological\/transvaginal mesh implants for the management of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in HSE funded hospitals, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so.<\/p>  <p>2.

A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has informed the Department of Health that a Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advice is that all patients who have experienced complications due to mesh devices are advised to contact their consultant&rsquo;s clinic in the first instance.  Each hospital group has nominated an individual to coordinate a response to this group of patients.

I understand that, to date, only one complaint has been received by Irish authorities regarding difficulties encountered at the Dublin Airport preclearance facility. I understand that no actions have been taken against the State to date in relation to Preclearance.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, no US Preclearance Officer has been sanctioned under Section 13 (4) of the Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2009.<\/p>  <p>  Passengers who wish to avail of Preclearance do so voluntarily and on condition that they recognise the right of the US to grant or refuse Preclearance in accordance with its immigration rules.  Passengers retain the right to withdraw from the Preclearance process at any time before they board their flight.  <\/p>  <p>  Preclearance is not compulsory.  Airlines choose to apply to have their services precleared at Dublin or Shannon Airports, on the basis that they may then offer the service as an added bonus for their customers.  Although the majority of carriers operating services to the US choose to apply to have their flights precleared, at least one carrier has chosen not to. As Dublin and Shannon Airports are the only airports in Europe with Preclearance facilities, passengers can also choose to fly to the USA from other European airports and post-clear for entry on arrival in a US airport.  Border control at US airports is also carried out by US Customs and Border Protection, the same organisation that processes passengers for Preclearance in Ireland. The same procedures and criteria for entry will therefore apply whether a passenger preclears or post-clears.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the Government&rsquo;s concern as to the content of a US Presidential Executive Order, signed in January 2017 (later superseded by legal action and further Orders) which banned nationals of seven named countries from entering the United States, and in particular concerns that had been expressed that the existence of US Preclearance facilities in Ireland might mean that Ireland was breaching international, EU or domestic legal obligations, the Taoiseach directed that a review be undertaken. My Department, along with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality contributed to the review which was furnished to the Taoiseach in February 2017.<\/p>  <p>  That review concluded that the operation of Preclearance does not give rise to any breach of Ireland&rsquo;s European or International Human Rights obligations. Additionally, a refusal at US Preclearance has no impact on the rights available to refugees or persons wishing to seek asylum in Ireland. In light of this, and given the significant benefits of Preclearance to Ireland, it was recommended that US Preclearance arrangements in Dublin and Shannon Airports should remain in place. The Government endorsed this recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  The Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America on Preclearance requires An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide an appropriate and sufficient law enforcement presence to ensure the security of the Preclearance area and safety of Preclearance officers, travellers and airport staff. Law enforcement agencies, including US Customs and Border Protection consult and collaborate regularly to ensure the safety and security of all airport users. <\/p>  <p>  Oversight of the operation of Preclearance in Ireland is provided via the US \/ Ireland Preclearance Consultative Group (PCCG). The PCCG consists of representatives from both sides and meets regularly (on an annual basis) to review any issues arising related to the Agreement.  While local airport mechanisms are used to address issues pertinent to a particular Preclearance location, issues which cannot be resolved at a local level can be referred to the PCCG.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800079#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":684,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800080#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":685,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[42828\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800080#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he and-or his departmental officials have met a person (details supplied) and-or representatives of companies in the past two years to date; if so, if he will publish a schedule of those meetings and the associated minutes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":686,"content":"<p>No such meetings took place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800080#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Services Data","counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800080#WRT00800"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[42838\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800080#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of complaints made against Irish Rail regarding Cork routes or stations; the nature of these complaints for 2017 and the first six months of 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the company for direct reply.

Sustainable Mobility, of which the following is allocated toward specific programmes as raised by the Deputy: <\/p>  <p>  - BusConnects &euro;2.4billion<\/p>  <p>  - MetroLink &euro;3billion<\/p>  <p>  - DART Expansion &euro;2billion.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the NDP also commits toward the construction of a new National Train Control Centre, while the Deputy is presumably aware that the Phoenix Park Tunnel project is in fact already completed and open for passenger services. I am advised that the total capital cost of the project was &euro;13.5million.<\/p>  <p>In relation to maintenance of the heavy rail network, my Department provides annual capital funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the maintenance and renewal of the network under the Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract   (IMMAC) which is a requirement of EU law. Details of funding provided each year is published in the Company&rsquo;s Annual Report. Under the current IMMAC, which is for the period 2014-2018, a total of &euro;737.43 million has been allocated from the Exchequer to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. A new IMMAC is currently being finalised to cover the next reporting period .<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that as part of the annual Estimates process, the multi-annual capital allocations for Government Departments under the NDP will be reviewed and extended annually on a rolling basis to cover the coming 5-year period.  This will provide Government with an annual opportunity to review the allocations in light of any implementation issues arising and\/or new priorities which may emerge as the NDP is implemented.  <\/p>  <p>  The NDP also commits to a full mid-term review of the Plan in 2022, to allow Government to take stock of progress in terms of delivery of the planned projects and programmes, and to allow Government to review and reaffirm its investment priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be carried out in order to prepare and publish a new updated 10-year plan for public capital investment in 2023, covering the period 2023 to 2032. <\/p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility for implementation of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply in relation to the various GDA projects.

It is estimated that applying the recently announced budget increases would increase the cost by &euro;0.07m in the first year and in 2071 the cost would increase by &euro;0.5m.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.  In Budget 2019, it was announced that self-employed workers will become eligible for jobseeker's benefit from Quarter 4, 2019. <\/p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   <\/p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800086#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Eligibility","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800086#WRZ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":831,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[42783\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800086#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full-year cost of extending the free travel scheme to children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, taking into account increases announced in budget 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":832,"content":"<p>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.

The main income supports provided by my Department include Carer's Benefit, Carer's Allowance, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant.  Spending on these payments in 2018 is expected to amount to almost &euro;1.2 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  Credited contributions, normally known as credits, are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Recipients of these payments qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the previous two years or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.  <\/p>  <p>  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the homemaker scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced in and from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State pension (contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the State pension (contributory) rate of payment when the rate of pension is calculating using the Yearly Average method.   In January this year the Government announced that those affected by the rate band changes made in September 2012 would see their entitlement calculated using a Total Contributions Approach.  This would involve the award of credits for periods of up to 20 years spent as a HomeCarer.  If the pensioners payment was to be increased, they would be backdated to March 2018 and it is expected to make first payments in early 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Through the award of credits, the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme and the new HomeCarers credit, the social insurance system already gives significant recognition of carers in terms of the State Pension.<\/p>  <p>  Any further changes made to social insurance schemes would have cost implications which would need to be considered in a budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;232 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance. Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review. However, any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in a budgetary context  and in the light of available financial resources.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800086#WRZ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":844,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800086#WRZ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":845,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[42787\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101800086#WRZ02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she has considered the impact increasing the national minimum wage has on income disregards to qualify for payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":846,"content":"<p>I was pleased to announce that the National Minimum Wage will increase from &euro;9.55 per hour to &euro;9.80 per hour with effect from the 1st January 2019.

The Exchequer contribution is &euro;275 million with &euro;35 million to be contributed by local authorities. In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p>  <p>  A first call for proposals, under the SSF, issued to local authorities in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, Cork and Galway on 29 June 2018. The closing date for applications was 31 August and 15 proposals were received from 9 local authorities. These are currently being assessed and I expect this process to be finalised and an announcement of the first successful bids to be made in the coming weeks.  Further calls for proposals will be made thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Once the funding is awarded and the infrastructure is provided I expect delivery of affordable homes from 2019 onwards.

Under the 2009 Act, the maximum discount is 40% of the market value of the home and the local authority takes a charge, equivalent to the discount, against the property.
