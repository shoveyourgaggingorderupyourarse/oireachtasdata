These are significantly reduced rates on commercial loans rates of the same term and size.<\/p>  <p>  While these loans are predominantly being used for working capital purposes (58%), they are also being used for reinvestment purposes such as purchase of equipment and premises fit-out (26%).\u00a0 To date (8 April), &euro;36m of lending under the scheme has been to businesses in accommodation and food services.<\/p>  <p>  Loans available under the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million and are for terms of up to three years. Loans are offered at favourable terms, including a maximum interest rate of 4% with no security on loans of up to &euro;500,000.<\/p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.\u00a0 It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.\u00a0 Subsidised rates of interest have been applied in respect of the COVID-19 Business Loan and Brexit Business Loan with an interest rate of 4.5% available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.<\/p>  <p>  In July of 2020, the Future Growth Loan Scheme was expanded by &euro;500m. This scheme offers state guaranteed loans to businesses seeking to make long-term investments. It has seen strong uptake since its expansion and this is an indication that businesses are planning and making investment for a post-COVID-19 environment. As of the most recent quarterly report (to end December 2020), businesses in the accommodation and food service sector account for approximately &euro;21.68m of the lending drawn under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I would strongly encourage businesses to avail of the low-cost lending facilities provided under the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as they look towards reopening. This scheme is available until 31 December 2021 and supports both investment and liquidity needs for businesses affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland and is available through a range of lenders including commercial banks, certain credit unions and non-bank lenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200070#WRA00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":6,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200070#WRA00350"},{"type":"question","counter":7,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[20867\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200070#WRA00400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of the return of click and collect options\/for non-essential retail services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":8,"content":"<p>I understand that this is an incredibly difficult time for businesses and their customers across the country and would like to thank them for their continued support of the national effort through this unprecedented public health crisis.<\/p><p>Under Level 5, in line with public health guidelines, only essential retail outlets will remain open and the current temporary restrictions in Level 5 will stay in place until at least 4 May 2021.

For cross border consumer protection issues, the CCPC is part of the European Consumer Protection Co-operation (CPC) Network, which is comprised of national authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. This network protects consumers when conducting transactions across national borders, and allows consumer protection agencies to co-operate to resolve particular consumer issues. The CPC Network is central to addressing this matter, which involved the purchase by consumers of properties in France. These properties were developed, marketed, sold and managed by French traders under a French &lsquo;Residence de Tourisme&rsquo; scheme devised by the French Government to provide tourist accommodation in France. Under the European CPC network, the appropriate authorities to conduct an investigation in relation to this matter are the French consumer protection authorities &ndash; Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R&eacute;pression des Fraudes (&lsquo;DGCCRF&rsquo;). <\/p>  <p>  When Irish persons who purchased property as part of this scheme first contacted the CCPC in 2017, they recognised the fact that the consumer protection mechanisms put in place through the CPC Network were the appropriate channel to effectively progress the matter. On this basis, the CCPC engaged with the DGCCRF with respect to the issues highlighted by Irish property purchasers. Over 2017 and 2018 the CCPC conducted and provided to the DGCCRF an initial preliminary assessment of over 150 Irish complainants and the issues raised by them.\u00a0 Following a request from the DGCCRF investigation service, the CCPC sought the transactional documentation of over 150 Irish property purchasers.\u00a0 This transactional documentation was collated by the CCPC and provided to the DGCCRF in 2019.\u00a0 In January 2020, the CCPC was able to advise complainants that the DGCCRF had commenced a criminal investigation.\u00a0 In April 2020, the CCPC was advised that due to COVID-19 the DGCCRF investigation had been disrupted and that this had delayed progress on the matter. \u00a0The CCPC has dedicated a considerable amount of resources in order to progress this work in a timely fashion, in order to support complainants and ensure that all pertinent information was provided to DGCCRF. <\/p>  <p>  The CCPC has provided and continues to provide significant time and resources to this matter and to supporting the DGCCRF investigation. They receive regular contact from complainants in relation to the matter and the CCPC has endeavoured to provide whatever information and support that is within their remit. In addition, throughout the period of engagement with the DGCCRF, whenever issues have been raised by Irish property purchasers, the CCPC has passed these on to DGCCRF and taken whatever additional steps requested by DGCCRF. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the response to PQ No. 13952\/21, in order to protect the integrity of the investigation and comply with relevant French criminal procedural codes, DGCCRF requested that the CCPC does not comment or communicate on the investigation other than the updates which have been provided. The CCPC has strictly adhered to this request. However, CCPC has continued to engage with them and to seek updates on progress. Should DGCCRF provide any update that can be passed on to complainants, the CCPC will action that as quickly as possible and ensure that all of the complainants are informed. The CCPC&rsquo;s priority in relation to this matter is to continue to support the DGCCRF investigation and to ensure that they comply with the legal procedural requirements of the French criminal investigation process.  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200070#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200070#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[21025\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200070#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his plans to review redundancy legislation in relation to correspondence (details supplied).","asker":"1572","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>I fully appreciate the difficult circumstances that employees are facing.

The measure was brought into effect from 13th March 2020 and given the ongoing serious risks to businesses and jobs, the Government decided to extend the provision to 30th June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to extend these provisions further has been a difficult one and the Government acknowledges that it will come as a disappointment for many employees who want certainty in relation to their redundancy entitlements. However, due to the ongoing public health situation and restrictions which remain in place, serious risks to businesses and jobs remain. If the Government did not extend the emergency provision further employers will be subject to significant redundancy claims which will damage the ability of a business to recover and result in insolvency situations which will only exacerbate the risk of further permanent job losses.<\/p>  <p>  All other redundancy provisions remain unchanged and in force.

Section 118(5G) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides for this scheme. This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee. Under section 118B TCA 1997, an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment. Where a bicycle or safety equipment is purchased under the Cycle to Work scheme or through a salary sacrifice arrangement, certain conditions must be met. Further guidance regarding the Cycle to Work scheme and salary sacrifice arrangements can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website. The Cycle to Work scheme is available to all staff in my Department and is centrally administered for my Department by HR Shared Services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a number of facilities to aid staff who actively travel to work. There are dedicated secure bicycle parking facilities across a number of locations and the installation of a dedicated bicycle repair station is currently in progress. My Department also has a dedicated drying room, where staff can dry wet gear. There are a number of shower cubicles in all buildings occupied by my Department, which staff can utilise as required and an increase in the capacity of shower cubicles is currently in progress.<\/p>  <p>  Active travel is not an issue for a number of the 17 bodies under the aegis of my Department, namely the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the Credit Union Restructuring Board, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee is not a State agency, rather it is a committee set up to advise the Minister for Finance on credit union issues. The Credit Union Restructuring Board was operationally wound down in 2017, having concluded its restructuring work and is awaiting formal dissolution. The Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal do not have employees.<\/p>  <p>  The remaining bodies under my Department&rsquo;s remit have provided the following on how they encourage and facilitate their employees to use active travel to commute to work:<\/p>  <p>  Before moving to its headquarters in North Wall Quay (NWQ), the Central Bank of Ireland published a Smarter Travel Action Plan on its intranet site, aimed at helping staff with the move to the NWQ campus and encouraging a shift to sustainable travel modes such as walking, cycling and public transport. The welcome pack to the new building, shared in advance of the move, highlighted all public transport options in the near vicinity and estimated times to walk from public transport stations and stops. The Bank is also considering a post-pandemic travel survey for all staff. The Central Bank provides secure bicycle spaces, showers, changing rooms and drying rooms across its city centre campus to support\/encourage staff to walk, run and cycle to work. These end of journey facilities, which include a bike maintenance station provide staff with the means to commute to work in a comfortable manner. Similar facilities are provided at the Bank&rsquo;s premises in Sandyford. In addition to the Bank&rsquo;s dedicated bicycle parking facilities, a Dublin Bike park is located close to the NWQ premises. The Bank&rsquo;s Facilities Management team meets regularly with a staff cycling liaison group to discuss any issues, and ensure provision of safe, secure and efficient facilities. The Bank also advertises the Cycle to Work scheme for staff twice per year. In conjunction with other organisations in the area and independently, the Bank has been in regular communication with the National Transport Authority to review transport options in the NWQ district.<\/p>  <p>  The Investor Compensation Company shares a premises with the Central Bank and all staff are seconded from the Bank. As such, any facilities provided by the Bank or measures taken by the Bank to encourage active travel, as set out above, also apply to the Investor Compensation Company.<\/p>  <p>  Staff in the Credit Review Office are seconded from Enterprise Ireland. Enterprise Ireland (EI) is a body under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and as such EI is responsible for any measures taken to encourage and facilitate staff in the Credit Review Office to use active travel to commute to work.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has a large number of bicycle parking facilities and can easily facilitate those who bike to work. The Office also has changing rooms and showers at its premises, to facilitate those who use active travel to commute to work.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council includes information on the Cycle to Work scheme in its employee handbook\/HR manual. A large number of employees have availed of this scheme since beginning their employment with the Council.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman encourages employees to commute to work using active travel by promoting the Cycle to Work scheme and making facilities available for staff who cycle to work. On the implementation of its Return to Work plan, it will encourage active travel, both in the context of overall employee wellbeing and the potential impact on passenger numbers on public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) are State Boards under my Department&rsquo;s remit. The NTMA provides business, facilities and support services to NAMA, HBFI and the SBCI, and operates the Cycle to Work Scheme to encourage employees to use active travel to commute to work. The NTMA&rsquo;s Treasury Dock building has various facilities to encourage walkers, runners and cyclists such as bicycle parking spaces, changing rooms and drying rooms for wet gear.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has in place an active employee wellbeing framework that includes encouragement to employees to remain active to support their wellbeing. Revenue supports cycling to work via the government Cycle to Work scheme. Having regard to the current Covid-19 health restrictions, some 80% of Revenue staff are working from home. Those staff who are attending the workplace are advised to avoid the use of public transport and to walk or cycle to work where possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission has been actively promoting the Cycle to Work scheme for its staff and secure bicycle racks are available to meet the needs of staff. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200071#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200071#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[21075\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200071#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is specific evidence or analysis conducted by his Department that confirms that an increase in the State pension age would lead to significant long-term cost savings for the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>In March 2021, the Department of Finance made a submission to the Commission on Pensions, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.The analysis set out in the document attempts inter alia to quantify the likely budgetary costs of population ageing in order to inform the appropriate policy response. It builds on work undertaken by the Department of Finance in conjunction with other Finance Ministries in the European Union, together with the European Commission, through the EU Ageing Working Group.<\/p><p>While Ireland&rsquo;s demographic structure is relatively favourable at present, shifting demographics in the coming decades will result in a slower pace of economic expansion and increased expenditure pressures putting significant pressure on the public finances. Recent projections from Eurostat point to Ireland having one of the most rapidly ageing populations in the EU over the coming decades. \u00a0Revenue increases will not be sufficient to fund all of these additional costs. This is because growth in the productive capacity of the Irish economy is set to slow significantly, as demographic trends weigh on additional labour supply. As public revenue evolves in line with economic growth, slower revenue growth will make it more difficult for the public finances to absorb the increase in age-related spending.<\/p><p>Up until the passing of the Social Welfare Act 2020, the State Pension Age (SPA) was legislated to increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. The analysis undertaken by the Department includes analysis on the projected long-term cost of this change in legislation, based on the SPA remaining at 66 years of age for the projection period. While the analysis does not refer specifically to the impact solely on the Exchequer, the analysis suggests keeping the SPA unchanged at 66 years of age will result in significant additional annual expenditure on pensions. The increasing SPA scenario estimates that annual pension expenditure would be 0.9 percentage points of GNI* lower in 2070 than the baseline with an unchanged SPA. The estimated cumulative cost of this policy decision is projected to amount to approximately &euro;50 billion by 2070.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department&rsquo;s analysis also foresees a significant impact on the general government balance and debt-to-income ratio as a result of population ageing. In a no-policy change scenario, age-related increases in public expenditure and a slower pace of revenue growth are predicted to lead to the emergence of a significant deficit by the end of the next decade, reaching around 3 per cent of GDP (4.7 per cent of GNI*). The deficit is projected to continue to increase sharply thereafter, reaching just below 6 per cent of GDP (9.4 per cent of GNI*) by 2070, without policy intervention. As a result of these developments, the debt-to-income ratio is projected to increase by 54 percentage points of GDP, (or 86 percentage points of GNI*) to reach 112 per cent of GDP, (182 per cent of GNI*), by 2070. The Department&rsquo;s analysis estimates that maintaining the SPA at 66 accounts for nearly 20 percentage points of the increase in the debt-to-GNI* ratio of 86 percentage points to 182 per cent of GNI*.<\/p><p><i><\/i>.<\/p><p>[2] Assuming discount rate of 4 per cent per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200071#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200071#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[21076\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200071#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the policy on the State&rsquo;s shareholding in the banks (details supplied) should be reviewed given the recent developments and the consolidation within the banking and financial sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>The Government does not see the State as a long-term investor in the banking sector and its policy of selling down its investments in the Irish banks remains unchanged.

In terms of the SAR process underway, ultimately, decisions on the scope, nature and procurement strategy for the next service will be a matter for Government once the detailed business case has been finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200073#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200073#WRD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[20949\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200073#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the arrangements for the establishment of an independent military air regulator within his Department, the establishment of which has been recommended by previous independent safety reports and is also common practice in other EU states; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>The Department of Defence commissioned a report from an expert consultancy firm, Bureau Veritas (BV), to exam military aviation regulation, oversight and safety in the Irish context.

A Certificate of Exemption from the study of Irish may be granted by the management authorities of the special school\/class to a pupil in order to facilitate their transition back to a mainstream school\/ class.<\/p><p>In line with the department&rsquo;s policy special schools\/schools with special classes are expected and encouraged to provide all pupils, to the greatest extent possible and in a meaningful way, with opportunities to participate in Irish language and cultural activities at a level appropriate to their learning needs.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A\u00a0formal application for an exemption from the study of Irish is required for students who meet the criteria outlines in Subsection 2.2 of the Circular but are not enrolled in a special class. <\/p><p>In relation to stress and anxiety, schools can best promote the wellbeing of students through a multi-component, preventative, whole school approach.\u00a0 In line with best practice, The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) encourages schools to adopt a whole school, continuum of support approach to provide for children and young people&rsquo;s wellbeing needs.\u00a0 This involves three levels: Support for All, Support for Some and Support for Few.\u00a0 <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>If the parent\/guardian or student over 18 years of age is not satisfied that the school principal has followed the correct procedures in making a decision to refuse to grant an exemption from the study of Irish, then the parent\/guardian or student over 18 years of age can complete an Irish Exemption Appeal Form setting out the specific reason(s) why the decision is being appealed and the circumstances in which it is considered that the process has not been correctly applied. \u00a0The completed Irish Exemption Appeal Form should be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date the decision of the school not to grant an exemption was notified in writing to the parent(s)\/guardian(s)\/student.<\/p><p>Officials in my department have enquired into the case above and note that the principal of the school determined that the pupil&rsquo;s circumstances do not meet the criteria set out in the circular and that no appeal was received by the department in relation to the decision. Officials from the department have previously responded to correspondence from the child&rsquo;s mother on the matter and have advised her that it is not possible to grant an exemption outside of the the exceptional circumstances outlined in the circulars. <\/p><p>As is the case for a pupil\/student who encounters difficulty with the study of Irish and who does not have an exemption from the study of Irish, schools are required to address a wide diversity of needs by providing a differentiated learning experience for pupils\/students in an inclusive school environment. <\/p><p>The Primary Language Curriculum is for children of all abilities in all school contexts. \u00a0This is informed by the principles of inclusion and the benefits of bilingualism for all students that underpin the Primary Languages Curriculum. \u00a0It recognises and supports pupils&rsquo; engagement with Irish and English at different stages and rates along their language-learning journey. \u00a0It builds on the language knowledge and experience that pupils bring to the school. \u00a0The Progression Continua in the Primary Language Curriculum provide a framework for teachers to identify the pupil&rsquo;s stage of language development and to plan interventions that support the development of language skills and competences in Irish and in English in an integrated manner, emphasising the transferability of language skills across languages. \u00a0All pupils are encouraged to study the language and achieve a level of personal proficiency that is appropriate to their needs and ability.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Similarly, at post-primary level, the Irish language curriculum is informed by the principles of inclusion and the benefits of bilingualism for all students that underpin the Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) and curricular provision in senior cycle. \u00a0Students should be encouraged to study the language and achieve a level of personal proficiency that is appropriate to their ability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200074#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[20920\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200074#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the schools which have been compelled to open ASD classes in Dublin 12; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[20922\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200074#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of plans to further compel schools to open ASD classes in Dublin 12; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":246,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 83 together.<\/p><p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs\u00a0is a priority for this Government.\u00a0<\/p><p>This year, over 20% of the total Education\u00a0budget or &euro;2bn\u00a0will be\u00a0invested in supporting children with special educational needs.As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.\u00a0<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. <\/p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need.\u00a0This process is ongoing.

The HSE has advised the Department that additional supports including home support, meals on wheels, telephone support, additional public health nursing, virtual activities etc. have been provided for most vulnerable clients during this period.  In addition, the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association of Ireland have been providing &lsquo;Day Care in the Home&rsquo; across the country for clients with Dementia. <\/p>  <p>  Since November 2020, a Day Care Focus Group Office has been in place with representation from across the HSE and voluntary organisations to put in place a plan for the reopening of Day Care Services for Older People in line with the COVID roadmap.  The Group has met on 6 occasions with the focus on putting in place guidance and plans for the resumption of Day Care Services, as soon as possible.  The group was originally concentrating on what services could be delivered under current guidance and in line with the current COVID Roadmap and have now extended their approach based on the COVID vaccination programme and the impact this can provide on how services can re-open. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the vaccination programme currently being rolled out to persons over 70 years of age, further guidance has been sought from Public Health in relation to the provision of Day Care Services and how these can be operated safely and in line with the measures in place to ease restrictions over the next few months. <\/p>  <p>  Day Care Service been also been asked to assess what can currently be delivered and requirements to reopen. A sub-group has also been established to develop an individualised Risk Assessment that can be carried out in respect of clients returning to the services.  It will not be feasible at present under Level 5 restrictions and current guidance in place to deliver a service in a congregated setting but plans will be put in place in conjunction with Public Health advice by each service in relation to the resumption of services so that Day Care Services can resume as soon as it is considered safe to provide the service.  <\/p>  <p>  Areas to be focused on will include:- <\/p>  <p>  - Safe transport <\/p>  <p>  - Protection of carers who have not been vaccinated and the impact of this. <\/p>  <p>  - Identification of clients who are safe to return to Day Care Services. <\/p>  <p>  - Supports for clients who will not be in a position to return to Day Care Services. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has reassured the Department that it will continue to focus on the re-opening of Day Care Services as a priority and the Focus Group in place will continue to drive a plan to resume these services as soon as possible.

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.<\/p><p>Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. <\/p><p>This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il.

However, the Programme for Government commits to introducing this amendment to the Nursing Home Support Scheme and work on the legislation has continued to progress. Officials in my Department and draftspeople in the Office of the Attorney General have been working intensively on drafting this legislation for several months, and I am pleased to say that a finalised draft of the Bill has now been signed by the Attorney General. I am sure you will appreciate that several steps must be completed before the Bill is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, including its approval by Government. I expect to bring the Bill to Cabinet for approval in the next couple of weeks. It will be published very shortly thereafter and presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200079#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200079#WRK01800"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[21040\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200079#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment nationally by CHO area; the number on the waiting list in the Dublin north city and county area; the number in each area who are in grade 5i level of severity in tabular form; the estimated length of time a patient can expect to wait for treatment such as in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200079#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200079#WRK02100"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[21054\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200079#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which his Department and agencies under his remit encourage and facilitate employees to use active travel to commute to work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>Currently, during level 5 restrictions, all staff in my Department have been advised to work from home except where it is essential that they work onsite.

The purpose of the bulletin is to ensure awareness of published research evidence that may support the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Ireland. This is relevant to the co-ordination of communications on the vaccine rollout and aspects of the work of the sub-groups IEMAG (Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group) and CBAG (Communications and Behavioural Advisory Group). The bulletin supports the work of these groups by keeping abreast of emerging evidence from COVID-19 vaccine-related research publications. <\/p><p>This bulletin is circulated widely, including to the Minister for Health, individuals on the Senior Management Team, members of IEMAG, CBAG, and the Vaccines Taskforce, and other staff in the Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Research &amp;amp; Development &amp;amp; Health Analytics, and Health Protection divisions within the Department of Health. The study referenced was included in the latest issue of the bulletin, that was circulated on Tuesday 20<sup>th<\/sup>April 2021. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the study referenced is, as the Deputy points out, a preprint. This means that the findings are preliminary and have not been peer-reviewed, which is a significant step in evaluating and validating the quality and credibility of a research publication. <\/p><p>New evidence related to COVID-19 vaccines is routinely circulated to the Office of the Chief Medical Officer and is also taken into consideration by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). NIAC is an independent expert group that provides?evidence-based advice to the Department of Health on vaccines,?immunisation?and related health matters to inform health policies in Ireland.  <\/p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently concluded an investigation into a number of reports of very rare, unusual blood clots occurring with low platelets in people following vaccination with Vaxzevria&reg; COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. The EMA has added these unusual clotting events with low platelet counts as very rare side effects to the product information. This event is estimated to occur between 4 and 10 in every 1 million people. However, as so few events have been reported, there is a high level of uncertainty regarding the incidence of this extremely rare adverse event in any particular age group or gender. Although most cases of this rare event occurred in women under 60 years of age, this may be because of the higher rate of vaccination in healthcare workers who are predominantly female. In the UK the reported rate of events adjusted by sex and vaccination status was similar in men and women. A UK suggestion of a possible increasing incidence of this adverse event in the younger age groups has not been confirmed based on available European Economic Area (EEA) data. The EMA has requested new studies and amendments to ongoing ones to provide more information. <\/p><p>The risk\/benefits of Vaxzevria&reg; may vary by age. As alternative COVID-19 vaccines are available NIAC has revised the recommendations for use of this vaccine:<\/p><p>- Any authorised COVID-19 vaccine, including Vaxzevria&reg;, is recommended for those aged 60 years and older including those with medical conditions with very high or high risk of severe COVID-19 disease <\/p><p>- Vaxzevria&reg; is not recommended for those aged under 60 years including those with medical conditions with very high or high risk of severe COVID-19 disease <\/p><p>- A second dose of Vaxzevria&reg; should not be given to anyone who developed unusual blood clots with low platelets after the first dose <\/p><p>- Those who have received a first dose of Vaxzevria&reg;:<\/p><p>1.  Aged 60 and older should receive their second dose 12 weeks later as scheduled <\/p><p>2.  Aged under 60 years:<\/p><p><b>- with <\/b>a very high risk or high-risk medical condition should receive their second dose 12 weeks later as scheduled<\/p><p><b>- without <\/b>a very high risk or high-risk medical condition should have the scheduled interval between doses extended to 16 weeks to allow further assessment of the benefits and risks as more evidence becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200081#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200081#WRM00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200081#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[20862\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200081#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on increasing the resources and staff of the forestry appeals and licensing process to ensure that all licences and appeals are processed in a timely manner including the clearing of the substantial backlog.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[20863\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200081#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the details of the average waiting times for licensing applications and appeals in the forestry appeals and licensing process between 1 September 2020 and 31 March 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.<\/p><p>I am aware of the issues facing the forestry sector and the timber industry and considerable efforts have been made to address them.

This new structure aims to ensure that the current backlog is addressed. The Project involves a review and refresh of our processes and procedures and includes outside stakeholder participation to bring an independent perspective. It is a task-driven process, with clear deliverable and milestones.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that there are always licences in the system at various stages of processing. These are the initial stages of an application being made, while the registered forester finalises application documents to referral to prescribed bodies, referral to the inspector and\/or ecologist\/archaeologist, to making final decision. Applications may also be returned to the applicant (and their registered forester, where relevant) for further information. A target to issue 4,500 licences in 2021 has been set which is a 75% increase on 2020. <\/p><p>The total number of tree felling licences issued to end March this year is up 56% on last year and up by 20% on felling licences issued. For afforestation licences, while the number of licences issued is down slightly on last year, the area licensed is up by 18%.  Forestry road licences have far exceeded those issued to end March last year, the number issued is up 102% and the length of road licensed is up by 147% at over 75km.

The scheme provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and their gross pay. The Pandemic Unemployment Payment has also been available to self-employed aquaculture farmers whose trading income has ceased or reduced to &euro;960 over a rolling 8-week period, or aquaculture employees laid off because of the Pandemic.  These measures continue to be available to all sectors of our economy at very considerable cost.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout 2020, my Department met regularly with the Irish Farmers Association to hear their views on the impact of the Pandemic on aquaculture and to discuss their submissions seeking financial supports. This led to the implementation of a Covid-19 Aquaculture Support Scheme in the second half of 2020 under my Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme. This scheme was designed to address the needs for support identified by the IFA, specifically for the shellfish farming sector. The Scheme was open to rope mussel and oyster producers and provided a fixed payment based on enterprise size (in terms of historic production levels).  <\/p>  <p>  Payments were calculated to compensate for lost sales arising from the Pandemic over the period February to June 2020 and ranged from &euro;1,300 for the smallest rope mussel producers to &euro;9,000 for the largest, while for oyster producers who have higher costs of production, payments ranged from &euro;6,800 for the smallest producers to &euro;16,300 for the largest.  Some 152 aquaculture enterprises benefitted from the scheme at a cost of &euro;1.2 million, with a further 4 applications under consideration within BIM. The Scheme was well received by the IFA and the aquaculture sector.  <\/p>  <p>  On 13 April 2021, the IFA wrote to me seeking an extension of the scheme to compensate for Pandemic related losses arising in the second half of 2020.

Over 400 hubs have provisionally been identified, with the mapping and surveying of these hubs ongoing. The first iteration of this map will be published in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  This\u00a0data-gathering work has identified\u00a0an ecosystem of hubs operating across the country that is\u00a0varied in terms of location, capacity and\u00a0client base.\u00a0These hubs are also\u00a0diverse\u00a0in their\u00a0ownership models, running a wide range from directly state-owned, to\u00a0private-for-profit, to\u00a0social enterprises.\u00a0My Department, supported by the Western Development Commission and the other members of the Inter-Departmental Group, are now engaged in\u00a0the establishment of an integrated network of these remote working facilities with shared back-office services and a common booking engine for hub users. I expect to be in a position to outline the results of this work over the course of the year. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the supports and tools being developed under the National Hub Network programme, I have allocated &euro;5 million to fund a Connected Hubs Call under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme this year. This initiative will provide funding to support small scale capital works in existing hubs and Broadband Connection Points. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also continues to invest significantly in the provision of new Hub facilities across the country. Only this week, I announced &euro;75million for 24 landmark projects under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Many of the successful projects involve the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as Enterprise and Co-Working Hubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200082#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200082#WRN00900"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[21058\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042200082#WRN01000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the way in which her Department and agencies under her remit encourage and facilitate employees to use active travel to commute to work; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>The Department of Rural and Community Development has two office locations, one\u00a0in Dublin and\u00a0one\u00a0 in Mayo.
