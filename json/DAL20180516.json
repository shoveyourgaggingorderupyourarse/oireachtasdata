The development of the national claims information database is a complex project as insurers very often record data in different ways and do not necessarily use the same definitions.  At the end of 2017 work was completed by a data sub-group of the cost of insurance working group on the development of the legislation which would enable the Central Bank to perform this additional function.  On 19 December 2017 the Government approved the general scheme of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill.  The Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme on the list of priority legislation for publication this session.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach indicated to the Minister for Finance that it would not be conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, which is helpful.<\/p>  <p>  On 26 January 2018 the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel assigned a drafter to the Bill with whom officials in the Department of Finance are working to finalise a draft as soon as possible.  I understand good progress has been made and I am hopeful a Bill will be published before the end of this legislative session.  Consultation will also have to take place with the European Central Bank on the Bill once it is published.  As the Deputy is aware, it will take a certain amount of time following publication of the Bill for it to pass through the Houses.  I am hopeful the co-operation of all parties will ensure it will be passed by the Houses as quickly as possible.  To ensure the database can be operationalised quickly following the enactment of the legislation, the Central Bank has continued to work in parallel on the technical specification for the database.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the fraud database is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality whose Department is working on the project.  I have been informed that a working group chaired by the Minister which also comprises representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s National Economic Crime Bureau, Insurance Ireland and the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland is carefully considering the policy and legislative issues related to the new database and has consulted appropriate stakeholders, notably the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, ODPC.  I understand the group has completed a comprehensive report which was submitted to the ODCP for its consideration.  In its response the ODPC identified a number of challenges from a data protection perspective which must be addressed.  The working group is continuing to liaise with stakeholders to overcome these challenges and progress the recommendation.  Consequently, it is not possible at this time to provide a timeline for its establishment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600003#A00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Progress on insurance reforms has undoubtedly stalled.  The latest update report appeared online on Friday evening.  There was no press release and no alert.  When one examines it, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the real meat of the recommendations, the key reforms, is being nobbled.  They have certainly been stalled, at a minimum.  The national claims information database which aims to provide accurate and reliable data for claims affecting the insurance industry and policy holders was to be in place by next month, yet the full legislation has not been published.  It is well behind schedule.  It is a similar story with the fraud database; there is no sign of it.  The Minister of State says it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality, but it is a key component of the recommendations of the cost of insurance working group.  It is hard to disagree with the Alliance for Insurance Reform when it states progress has stalled.  The protocol which requires insurance companies to notify policy holders of progress on claims has stalled.  Legislation to compel insurance companies to communicate the reasons for large increases in premiums has been abandoned and there has been no progress on the Garda insurance fraud unit.  These are key elements of the reforms recommended which are not progressing.

In fairness to the Minister for Justice and Equality, there are a number of measures that will be implemented in quarter three.  They include data protection measures such as people having the opportunity to retain imagery and video related to a claim.  A person against whom a claim is being made must be informed within the permitted period to enable the data to be retained in order that he or she can mount a proper defence.  An improved pathway where a civil court judge says there is a potential element of a fraudulent or exaggerated claim has to be put in place.

I have to call it out when I see it because it is the case in this instance.  This is about reforming the claims process in order that policy holders will be given much more information at an earlier stage on claims made against them.  The results of the work of the Personal Injuries Commission are available.  It is benchmarking and looking at award levels in Ireland compared to those in other jurisdictions.  It is absolutely vital that that work be completed.  The Minister of State will have the full support of the House in driving through these reforms.  Where people are not meeting their responsibilities or embracing change and driving change, including Insurance Ireland and any of the large insurance companies, the Minister of State has an obligation to call it out for what it is.

The indications are that the equivalent award in Ireland is between three and five and a half times more.  That is the first piece of data we have and it is really helpful.  The book of quantum has been reviewed, but the only way it can be reduced is if the Judiciary reduces the awards made.  The book of quantum reflects the actual awards made, not the amounts we would like to think should be awarded.   When I speak about the cost of insurance, I always make the point that the reason it is so expensive in Ireland is the level of awards.

The long-term sustainability of corporation tax receipts and of the corporation tax system is therefore a key consideration in every budget cycle.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, my Department commissioned an independent review of the corporation tax code by Mr. Seamus Coffey.  The review was completed and published in June last year and contained 18 recommendations, some of which Mr. Coffey noted were very technical in nature and would require further consultation.  I commenced implementing the recommendations last year in budget 2018 with the reintroduction of the 80% cap on capital allowances for intellectual property, and a consultation was held early this year on the implementation of the remaining recommendations.  More than 20 submissions were received to this consultation, many of which were detailed and highly technical.

Consider the jump in trading profits from 2014 to 2015.  They go from &euro;98 billion to &euro;149 billion in one year.  It is a massive jump.  How much were the deductions and allowances for this record level of rocketing profits?  There was &euro;66 billion in allowances of various types and various deductions of &euro;30 billion.

In fact, in his report Mr. Seamus Coffey points out that the tax breaks these firms are getting are so high that the profits are driving up our gross national income so that we have to pay bigger contributions to the European Union, but the tax breaks mean that we do not get the benefit on the other side in tax revenue.

Any amounts restricted in one accounting period as a result of a cap are available for carry forward and use in a subsequent accounting period, subject to the application of the cap in that period.  Income generated by assets onshored during the period when the cap was not in place will therefore be taxed going forward when the capital allowances have been fully used.  The allowances are one of a number of measures designed to enhance the competitiveness of Ireland as a location for companies to develop intellectual property.  This recognises the fact that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by investment in intangible assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600008#F00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1526465700,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I have raised this with the Minister on numerous occasions.

They normally comprise three parts: an up-front deposit payment, ongoing monthly payments and a final payment at the end of the contract term.  While the consumer will have the hire and use of the car, ownership of it remains with the finance provider.  Hire-purchase providers are not required to seek authorisation from the Central Bank for the provision of hire-purchase agreements such as PCPs.  The consumer protection code of 2012 is a binding statutory code on entities regulated by the Central Bank.  As the category of hire-purchase provider is not authorised or regulated by the bank, however, the Central Bank advises that they are not subject, for the provision of a hire-purchase agreement, to the requirements of the code.  There is, however, legislation governing the operation of hire-purchase agreements, and this is provided for in the Consumer Credit Act.  Any entity providing hire-purchase agreements, or acting as intermediary in regard to such agreements, will have to comply with the relevant provisions of that Act.  Both the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission have certain functions under that Act.  The bank has an overall role in relation to the operation of such agreements and the commission has a role in regard to the authorisation of credit intermediaries.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is important to keep this new and growing area of consumer finance under review.

In terms of the documentation produced yesterday by the Department, these words ring very true because everybody within the national screening programme, CervicalCheck, at senior level in the HSE and key officials in the Department of Health and Children knew.  When Deputy Donnelly and I met the Minister, Deputy Harris, and his officials at that time, we got a commitment from the Minister that notwithstanding any inquiry to be established, he would publish information as he got it and he would not seek to suppress any D&aacute;il committee or the D&aacute;il considering the issues pertaining to the cervical cancer screening programme.<\/p><p>I was amazed last week when the three memos emerged at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I would have thought the Minister would have summoned his officials and demanded all of this documentation and published it in an ordered and structured way.  It has taken us three weeks to get to the level of documentation received yesterday.  The Taoiseach said on &quot;Six One&quot; last week that he does not think the Committee of Public Accounts is the place to discuss this matter, in respect of which Ministers followed suit.  There appears to be an agenda to push the Committee of Public Accounts and other D&aacute;il committees to one side.  We got a commitment from the Minister that no attempt would be made either to prevent publication or to prevent D&aacute;il committees doing their work on this matter and that the inquiry would not be used as an attempt to bury information away from the public domain.  The Government should adhere to this commitment.<\/p><p>In regard to the documentation, it is clear that the policy of open disclosure is very much a live issue throughout 2016.  Every month they are meeting and the CervicalCheck audit is on the agenda.  These are joint meetings between the Department of Health senior officials, the chief medical officer, the National Cancer Screening Service and CervicalCheck, and they are saying that while CervicalCheck supports the principles of open disclosure, it is recognised that there are limitations to its universal implementation, particularly for screening services where there is an inherent recognised error rate.  At the same time, the then Minister is proclaiming his commitment to introduce mandatory open disclosure.<\/p><p>Will the Minister, Deputy Bruton, commit to the publication of all the advice received by the then Minister from the chief medical officer on the policy of mandatory open disclosure?  Is the position of the senior officials in the HSE and CervicalCheck that an exemption is required from open disclosure in terms of the screening programme, filtering across the wider policy of going against what the Minister originally proclaimed publicly, namely, that he would introduce mandatory reporting?  This was subsequently changed in policy terms.  What is the reason for this and will the Minister, Deputy Bruton, commit to publication of the advice in regard to the <i>volte-face<\/i>in terms of open disclosure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600012#K00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1526468100,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to express again my personal shock and sympathy to the people who have been so appalling affected.  The non-disclosure was a major failure of public policy, given disclosure has been HSE policy since 2013.  It is categorically clear, however, that this never came to the attention of any Minister.  When it did come to the attention of Government, very swift action was taken to protect the people affected by way of a package of services, including the provision of a helpline, the establishment of international clinical oversight for any outcomes that come to light and the ones that have come to light, cancer screening rechecks and the establishment of an inquiry, headed by Dr. Scally, through which we will get answers such that this can never happen again.  I assure the Deputy that no document that will be withheld from those who want to inquire into what has happened in this instance.  There is no attempt by Government to restrict access to information, which the Minister made clear from the outset.  The fact that the Committee of Public Accounts is receiving information shows there is no attempt to withhold any information nor is there any attempt to confine the work of Oireachtas committees.  Oireachtas committees must work with others who are seeking to get clinical facts, but it is up to those committees to decide how they conduct their business.  I fully support this.<\/p>  <p>  On the reason for a staged approach to mandatory disclosure, this has been debated in the House.  I understand that an all-party Oireachtas committee recommended the approach of a introducing a voluntary disclosure process initially to encourage a culture change where people could openly discuss failures where they occur and not have this process constrained by liability issues blocking the honest conversations that should happen in a system.  We are moving, via the health information and patient safety Bill, to introduce mandatory disclosure for serious incidents.  This will be legally binding such that it will be an offence to fail to do so.  It was signalled in the programme for Government that we would do this over the five-year programme and we are doing it.  The change in regard to civil liability, the policy of disclosure and the legislative framework put in place in this regard was openly debated in the Oireachtas and it was done in the knowledge that mandatory disclosure was to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600012#K00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1526468100,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I will make two points.  First, the Taoiseach made a statement to the effect that the Committee of Public Accounts should not be involved in this matter, which was supported by some Ministers.  A meeting was held by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss whether the Committee of Public Accounts should do so and Deputy Harty, as Chairman of the Committee on Health, has stated in writing that he does not believe it should.  I am not saying any of this is connected and I am not joining any dots.  As party leader, I have never interfered with the Committee of Public Accounts nor given any guidance or instructions in this regard to anybody.  It is important that the Government does not attempt to muzzle a key committee of this House.  Whether one agrees with what it does or how it does it is beside the point.  It is a parliamentary committee.  Dr. Scally has also referenced the fevered atmosphere and so on.  I am raising this issue in a plenary session of the House because I do not think we would have had sight of those documents last week but for the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, said the Minister, Deputy Harris, is committed but he gave a commitment three weeks ago and we did not get information.  I find it inexplicable that people did not front up at that early stage and provide the documentation.<\/p>  <p>  Second, on open disclosure, what is evident in this documentation is an attempt to exempt the cervical screening programme from the strict rigours of open disclosure.  The templates for the letters to the women concerned provide consultants with a way out in terms of the use of the word \"may\".  It is clear there is a circumvention of open disclosure.  Is there any link between this and the decision of the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, not to proceed with his original commitment to introduce mandatory open disclosure?  It is an interesting point from a policy perspective.  Many people are making decisions without Ministers' knowledge and, equally, on substantive issues of policy, this appears to be the case also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600012#K00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1526468100,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The documentation shows categorically that neither the Taoiseach nor the current Minister for Health had any knowledge of the non-disclosure and, as such, it cannot be linked to any decisions that were made by Ministers or the Oireachtas in terms of how they should deal with this.<\/p><p>It is very clear that there can be no link because no information was made available to the Ministers concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600012#K00700","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526468700,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Will the Government publish the advice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600013#L00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1526468700,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The Minister will make available any documentation that is required by committees.

I must also be conscious, however, that the D&aacute;il is anxious that Dr. Scally would produce a report in June so we can have timely answers around the clinical implications, the protection we need to provide for women and the further follow-up that needs to occur to help women who are concerned.

This information is contained in a letter from CervicalCheck to the chief medical officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, in October 2016.  A separate memo in March 2016 says that doctors were told to use their judgment when deciding whether to inform women that their smear test results were wrong.  Such revelations highlight once again the urgent need for mandatory open disclosure to be legislated for as soon as possible.  I welcome the all-party support for Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s motion last night calling for this legislation to be introduced before the summer recess.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Health, the Taoiseach promised to introduce mandatory disclosure but, following advice from the chief medical officer, he changed his mind.  That was the wrong advice and the wrong decision in 2016.  Many of the women who are affected by the CervicalCheck scandal are only now being informed of their misread results.  The fact that the then Minister did a U-turn on his previous position on the basis of his advice indicates that the chief medical officer was a trusted and valuable source of advice for the Minister.  When one considers the fact that the chief medical officer was informed of this scandal around the same time, it would be useful and important to know the nature of the advice given to the then Minister in that regard.  Was it informed by knowledge of the CervicalCheck scandal or was it informed by any other medical scandal?<\/p>  <p>  If the chief medical officer knew of the issues surrounding CervicalCheck, it raises questions around how or why he did not inform the Minister of the issues at the time, as has been claimed by the Minister.  As the lead medical expert in the Department of Health, it is the job, duty and responsibility of the chief medical officer to advise and inform the Minister.  The fact that he claims not to have raised these matters with the Minister raises profound questions on the operation of the Department of Health and what exactly Ministers are told.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to respond to this point.<\/p>  <p>  Cultural, organisational and management failures have been identified as a result of this scandal.  Central to building confidence in every aspect of our health service must be the need for information, clarity and accountability.  All of that can be done if the political will is there.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports cancer screening services.  Let there be no doubt about that and let the message ring load and clear.  Screening services are vital in assisting in the early detection of cancers, but we need to ensure there is full public confidence and trust in the service.  Getting to the bottom of the failures identified as part of the CervicalCheck service can assist in rebuilding trust.<\/p>  <p>  I put to the Minister a question that I put to the Taoiseach yesterday.  Will the Minister tell the House when the cervical cancer screening audit and documentation relating to the US laboratories, which was promised to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health last week, will be published?  Will the Minister ensure that this information is published today?  He is in the Government, after all, so can he ensure it is published?  Perhaps the Minister will also respond to reports in the media that despite the resignation of Mr. Tony O'Brien on Friday, he will continue to be paid until the end of his contract in July?  Will the Minister inform Members what the Minister did when this information broke on the public airwaves as a result of the bravery of Vicky Phelan?  Did the Minister not have a conversation with the chief medical officer?  Did the Minister have a conversation with the director general of the HSE?

Essential tasks for our health service are screening and disease prevention.  Ensuring that we prevent unnecessary blindness is one example.  Approximately 75% of sight loss is avoidable.  At the end of last August, the inpatient waiting list for eye procedures was almost 12,500 people, the largest of any medical specialty.  If sight-saving treatment is not delivered, it puts people at risk of irreversible damage to their vision.<\/p>  <p>  Cataract surgery can restore impaired vision, but a survey by the Association of Optometrists Ireland published today shows incredibly long waiting lists across the country.  The average waiting period is 28 months, with up to a shocking five-year wait in some parts of the country, such as west Cork.  The survey also expressed concern about inconsistency and gaps in eye care services for children, in respect of whom there is an average waiting time of 15 months.<\/p>  <p>  The opening last year of a new eye and ear unit in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital doubled the number of procedures it could perform.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, stated then that this would over time eliminate waiting lists in the Ireland East Hospital Group.  That is welcome, but a nationwide programme is required.  When will a plan for the rest of the country to deal with these unconscionable waits be rolled out?  The lowest waiting time is in Sligo-Leitrim due to its award winning scheme.  There have been repeated calls for the Sligo post-cataract scheme to be rolled out nationwide.  Up to 20,000 procedures are carried out each year in Ireland, so this innovative scheme could radically reduce the number of appointments needed by people suffering blindness because of cataracts.  The scheme is referenced in the programme for Government, the benefits are known by everyone and there have been repeated requests for it to be rolled out.  As such, what will be done to increase the overall capacity for cataract operations in Ireland?  We have an ageing population and we must be equipped to meet future health needs as well as the current health needs of people whose quality of life is immeasurably improved by having better vision after cataract operations.

We have been told that these cases were not audited because the National Cancer Registry had not notified them to CervicalCheck.  This in itself raises important issues with the reliability of cancer data.  There is a question of data protection concerns preventing the registry from notifying CervicalCheck, but I understand that has since been resolved.<\/p><p>One must ask why it took so long to resolve such a basic issue.  We have since discovered that some 1,631 women were not included in the audit.  It is estimated by the Department of Health that approximately 20% of the women had a smear test prior to their cancer diagnosis, meaning that approximately 320 women are involved.  Many of them will have had their cancer indicated from their smear test but some will not and are left with major questions as to whether their smear test result was a false negative.  On the basis of the false negative rate among the cohort of women whose test results were audited, approximately 15% of the test results for the second group of 320 women are likely to be false negatives.  Thus, approximately 45 women who had false negative smear test results but who subsequently developed cervical cancer have not been responded to by the Government.  One woman in that position contacted me recently and was highly frustrated and annoyed that she had not been contacted.  How many of these women have been contacted and how many have had to contact the CervicalCheck helpline themselves?  Have their smear test results now been audited?

I am forever hearing that the problem in dealing with the housing crisis is capacity, by which we mean the capacity of the local authorities to have skilled workers who can build houses.  There are capacity problems in the health service.  I am referring to qualified health workers such as nurses and midwives.  In education, in providing services for persons with special needs, and the mental health service there is a real deficit which is becoming a problem in the provision of skilled workers.  Part of the problem at least is that a lot of younger people who are skilled and whom the State has paid to educate are leaving the country because wages are not sufficient to enable them to put a roof over their heads.  They go elsewhere, taking their skills and abilities with them and consequently robbing the State of the ability to deal with the lack of capacity in key public services and the provision of infrastructure.  The figures bear it out.  The Minister of State will say there is net inward migration.  However, it is clear from the further breakdown of the figures he has given that the biggest cohorts among the 64,800 leaving every year, a big number, are younger people who are educated.  The biggest cohort is young people with a third level education, while the next biggest is young people who have completed the leaving certificate programme.  It is obvious why they are leaving - they cannot afford to live here.  They are moving elsewhere, to places where they will be better paid and can afford to live.

That is anecdotal and not definitive to explain the movement.<\/p>  <p>  As a former sociology student, I thank the Deputies for the chance to delve into the figures again.  Ten years ago, we had net migration of more than 104,000 people which compares with 19,000 this year.  We had net immigration of 151,000 versus net emigration of 46,000.

The reason they cannot stay is because they cannot afford the rents and the health services are a nightmare because there are not enough people.  They all know people who are working abroad in far superior conditions and where the cost of living is affordable.

It has been said that we do not often discuss the future.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider why the Central Statistics Office does not have the data on shortages in the workforce, in industry and in the health service right across the spectrum.  Are the Government and the Department of Health aware of the shortages of staff and the resources needed in the health service to enable it to operate at reasonable capacity?  We should ensure it is not only operating on the basis of crisis management.  All aspects of the health service must function well.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should take bold steps to provide for the CSO to gather this information.  This information should be readily available to any Government embarking on a national development plan.  We saw all the bells and whistles associated with Project Ireland 2040.  What about the people integrated into that development plan?  Surely that development plan was about how we are going to have people living and working in the country.<\/p>  <p>  I am somewhat aghast that the figures are not readily available on the shortages throughout the spectrum.

Conditions of employment are of great importance.  The Minister of State said the national development plan is not only about the physical infrastructure.  More important, he said it is about people.  What is happening in the country at the moment with unbalanced regional development will have serious knock-on effects in the decades ahead.  We need to cater for education now.  We have seen the pressures when it comes to catering for education and college places.  Indeed, as people grow and live longer there will be major democratic decisions for Government right into the decades ahead.<\/p>  <p>  There is no integration.  First, the CSO needs to get all the data on where the shortages and employment opportunities are and make that information available to the Government.

The branch provides a vital programme for children with Down's syndrome aged between one and five years.  There are 52 children enrolled in the programme, under which early intervention specialists visit the homes of children with Down's syndrome for 90 minutes every two weeks throughout the year.  The specialists work with the child and his or her parents, providing a wealth of knowledge, experience and support.  The goal is to ensure every child reaches his or her full potential and is equipped to lead as independent a life as possible in adulthood.<\/p>  <p>  The early intervention programme does not have administration costs as it has been run by parents on a voluntary basis since its establishment in 1982.  For 36 years it has provided great support for children and parents.  Of the &euro;75,000 it costs each year to provide services for more than 50 children, approximately &euro;50,000 is raised by parents, with the balance of &euro;25,000 being met until now by HSE funding from lottery grant money.  In January the HSE reduced the grant it provides from &euro;25,000 to &euro;10,000, or by 60%.  It is extremely unfortunate that this meaningful and necessary programme will have to consider what impact the cut in funding will have.  It is highly likely the branch will have to reduce the number of home visits made to children for the first time since the programme began.  That would be devastating for the 52 families involved.  The &euro;15,000 the programme will lose is a significant amount and goes a long way towards helping children with Down's syndrome and their families. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years the organisation has shielded this vital programme from cuts because of a decline in fundraising income.  Unfortunately, it may no longer be possible to do so from September onwards.  We do not want children with special needs to fall behind.  Early intervention is vital and the specialists provide speech and language therapy and teach basic skills such as how to hold a pencil.  The aim is to allow the children to start primary school at the age of five or six years on the same terms as children without special needs.<\/p>  <p>  Parents raise &euro;50,000 per annum for the programme, which is a substantial amount of money.  In fairness to the Health Service Executive, for some years it also provided &euro;25,000 in annual funding before this funding was cut at the stroke of a pen.  As I stated, the Meath-Louth branch of Down Syndrome Ireland has been operating for 36 years.  It is an extremely important organisation and we must ensure it can continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600022#Z00300","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1526474400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath, who cannot be here, and also the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Jim Daly, who is currently in the Seanad, I am happy to outline the position on funding for the Louth-Meath Down Syndrome Ireland branch.<\/p>  <p>  The Louth-Meath branch is one of 25 branches of Down Syndrome Ireland.

It is not his fault.  This is a matter specifically to do with health.  It is good to have the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with responsibility for food, forestry and horticulture here to give the response but it does not inspire confidence in the level of prioritisation we are giving to key matters when he should be engaged in important work in his own brief and he is being sent in here to give a pre-written response by some official in the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I wrote, on 3 May, to the Minister in relation to a patient who has given her express permission to mention her name and wishes it to be mentioned.  Ms Haughney lives in Sligo.  She has cerebral palsy, asthma, arthritis and a shoulder complaint.  The seriousness of the condition is such that she is in a wheelchair.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Government's report, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A strategy for Community Inclusion, in 2011, Louise moved from residential care to independent living with a range of supports including physiotherapy, access to an occupational therapist on demand, home help hours or personal assistance hours.  Obviously, she was given access to a wheelchair.  She had a social worker, a case co-ordinator and a GP.<\/p>  <p>  What has happened since is Louise has effectively been abandoned by the system.  Through no fault of her own, she has not been provided with essential physiotherapy since 2015.  She has had no access to occupational therapists since April 2017, despite requesting and urgently needing one since July 2017 given her condition, and an urgent requirement for a new mould for her wheelchair.  She has no back-up wheelchair.  She has had no social worker since August-September 2017 and she has no case co-ordinator since a year ago.<\/p>  <p>  In a letter, Ms Haughney's GP states that in the past he sat around the table at primary care meetings, which are obviously time consuming, with all these individuals and it appears now that he is the only individual left on her primary care team.  He writes that she has been abandoned by the system, stating that this is an absolute joke.  The occupational therapist, who is the acting primary care occupational therapist, wrote back stating that she has seen some service users in Sligo town but just does not have the capacity to see Louise.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister of State that if this was the subject of an \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme, which may not be far away, or an afternoon hearing on the Joe Duffy show, this Chamber would be alive with calls of condemnation for the fact that this vulnerable person has been abandoned by the system.  Ms Haughney loves living independently and loves her home.  She was thriving with the supports that were put in place that the Government and those it manages have stripped out.<\/p>  <p>  Since this letter went to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on 3 May, I received the standard acknowledgement from the Department.  I also sent a message to the director general of the HSE, now out of post, whose replacement referred it to the parliamentary affairs division.<\/p><p>In the meantime, nothing has happened to this lady.  On the back of a referral from this doctor months ago, she was contacted by the community physiotherapist who, with an over-the-phone consultation, decided she needed to see an occupational therapist first before she saw the physiotherapist.  We are going around in circles.  I am beginning to know where all the managers are in our health service.  They are all talking to each other, writing to each other and referring to one another and the people who need care are being abandoned.<\/p> <p> I appreciate it is not the Minister of State's brief and it is not his fault he was sent here today but it is an indication of the level of autopilot and hands-off approach we are taking when it comes to individuals' care.  She wanted her name mentioned; it is Louise Haughney of McNeill Drive, Sligo.  I want to know by the end of the day that people have contacted her about occupational therapy, about moulding a new seat for her wheelchair, about providing the additional hours she needs and about providing the physiotherapy, occupational therapy and all other services she needs because it is unacceptable.

Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years.  As the Deputy will be aware, the overall health budget is in the order of &euro;15.3 billion.  Of this, the Health Service Executive has allocated funding of &euro;1.772 billion to its disability service programme.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE funds a range of community services and supports to enable each individual with a disability to achieve his or her full potential and to maximise independence.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Voluntary agencies provide the majority of services in partnership with, and on behalf of, the Health Service Executive.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, has been advised by the HSE that a number of therapy positions in its Sligo-Leitrim physical and sensory disability services and its Sligo-Leitrim primary care services are unfilled at present.  These posts include a neurological case co-ordinator key-worker position as well as vacancies in social work and occupational therapy.  The Minister of State fully appreciates the pressures that these vacancies are placing on service delivery.  However, he has been assured by the HSE that a process is under way to address these staffing deficits.  It is being progressed by the HSE through both its national recruitment service and its human resources department.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of specific services, this Government has committed to increasing the number of occupational therapists in primary care.  Funding of over &euro;1 million was allocated in the budget to provide for 40 additional occupational therapy posts to address waiting lists and improve access to services.  These posts are due to be recruited from quarter three.  Occupational therapists play an important role in primary care teams and work to meet the health needs of individuals, families and the community.  Their role is to provide individual intervention, assessment, advice, therapy or retraining for patients in the appropriate setting such as their institution, home, work, school or other centres.  The HSE has also established a service improvement group to develop a new model of provision for occupational therapy to ensure resources are effectively managed and service are maximised.  The work of this group is nearly completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600024#BB00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I know it is not the Minister of State's brief which is why I would love to be getting stuck in to the Minister of State who is responsible.

The money being spent is not being spent on the care of Louise Haughney, 10 McNeill Drive, Sligo town and that is a problem.  Is it being spent on extra managers?  We hired three new managers a week in 2017.  There has been an 11% increase in senior managers since 2011 and a 50% increase in middle managers since 2013.  We are over-complicating something that is very simple.  Louise Haughney needs 45 hours per week personal assistance, physiotherapy as is required for her condition, occupational therapy, a social worker, a case co-ordinator, a back-up wheelchair and a mould for the seat of the wheelchair she is currently in.  During Storm Ophelia, because somebody did not call to her house, she was confined to her bed for 19 hours, unable to avail of toilet facilities.  We cannot stand over this.

Regeneration has been promised for many years and it is not just a question of homes but of society.  We do not want to see hopes being built up and dashed again.  Our proposal is aimed not only at helping those on the housing and homeless list but also those who are excluded from the housing list who cannot afford the obscene, higher-than-ever rents being demanded everywhere in the city and beyond and who cannot afford a mortgage for the few homes that are for sale because of the runaway prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600024#BB01000","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The Minister of State knows we have been strongly critical of the land initiative model being used elsewhere in the city and country.  This originated at a time when capital budgets were more constrained and local authorities were desperately trying to find some way to fund public housing.  That is no longer the case and, according to the current senior Minister and his predecessor, money is no object and capital investment has increased.<\/p>  <p>  There are very strong arguments why these developments in particular, Shanganah Castle in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and St. Michael's Estate in Dublin city, should be taken out of the land initiative funding model and directly funded as part of the capital programme 2019.  Publicly funding them would give the Minister much greater control of the tenure mixture and the ratio of affordable and social, or affordable sale, if that is included, would be based on local need, not on what the market can bear.  The Minister would have much greater control of the development, particularly the timeline for its delivery.  Affordable rent and purchase could be controlled and guaranteed at rates that are genuinely affordable for families with modest incomes.  Sinn F&eacute;in is strongly of the view that if there are affordable sale options in either of these developments those units can never be sold into the private market and only ever sold back into the affordable scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Shanganah is a unique proposal.  It has unanimous support from the elected members of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council as well as the local community.  It is well designed and considered and is ready to go.  It has applied for stage 1 approval and I would welcome the Minister of State's confirmation of that.  It could be up and running by the end of this year, following approval from the Department.<\/p>  <p>  St. Michael's Estate has, unfortunately, despite the enormous campaigning by the local community experienced several failed public private partnership, PPP, regeneration projects.  Rather than force it to go through the process again there is a strong argument for leaving it out, as well as concerns about gentrification, given its location.  We have made this point privately to the Minister for State and now we are making it publicly.  Both of these sites provide unique opportunities for direct public funding for social and affordable, including cost-rental housing and we urge the Minister of State to consider including them in the capital budget 2019.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600025#CC00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I support what my colleagues have said.

Public investment in public land is a real part of the solution to our housing problem.  Between Shanganah and St. Michael's in Inchicore over 800 units could be delivered.

It is a matter of immense frustration to me, to the people on the housing list and the people in the area that a publicly owned site is sitting there, which is ideal for housing and could help alleviate a dire housing crisis.

There is some debate about the balance between those two but we can work that out among ourselves.  The key issue is that there has to be direct public funding of it.  If we have to depend on the private sector it will take forever.  We just need to build the houses.  The current scheme, in so far as it has been appraised, and which has been proposed and agreed on an all-party basis cannot work or deliver the affordable housing unless we get subsidies from the Government.  It brings into question the wider failure of the Government to come up with an affordable housing scheme.

It is hoarding thousands of acres.  In St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore this is very obvious as soon as one walks into the square.  Where the flats used to be there is a big unsafe space of approximately 12 acres.  It is about time we used it because in Dublin South Central there are over 7,000 people on the housing list and in Inchicore approximately 2,000.  Those are amazing figures.  I recall being a councillor at a time when there were 7,000 people on the housing list for the whole of Dublin city.  These figures are startling.  Despite the Minister's attempt to disguise the housing figures by saying those who are illegal should not also be registered as homeless, one can be both.  Despite his attempt in different ways to disguise the homeless list, it is growing.  There were 10,000 on it in April and some 3,755 of them were children.  We have a serious problem and the State needs to end the hoarding of land and to use initiatives such as the residents of St. Michael's Estate are proposing to have a cost-rental model that will allow immediate building instead of hoarding the land in the interests of the developers so that the price goes up and the deal can suit private development rather than land for public use.  This is public land and the only thing that should go on it is public housing.<\/p>  <p>  We will have to consider a model that will deliver that.  I do not know if the Minister of State has read the St. Michael's Estate document but I encourage him to read it.  Tremendous work has been done in the community on fair-rent homes.  The proposal is to allow people who have jobs and are not eligible to be on the social housing waiting list because they earn too much to be able to rent at an affordable price.  The State will continue to own the homes.  It is a very sensible model and I think there is cross-party support for it in Inchicore.

He is very honest in that regard, as am I and the departmental officials who are dealing with them.  Nobody is trying to disguise them, but if we believe a person is not homeless, we will say so.  A person who is living in a house is not counted as being homeless.  Others might believe he or she should be counted as such, but we do not.  We have engaged with the local authorities to identify who needs intervention from the State and who does not.  We must formulate policies to help those most in need.  We are doing all we can to ensure the figures are correct.  Whether the correct figure is 9,500, 9,800 or 10,000, it is far too many.

The two sites referred to are key housing authority assets that must be mobilised for the sustainable development of Dublin as a whole.  They are key sites that can be used to deliver a lot of houses.  I have visited both sites and recognise their importance in the delivery of housing.<\/p>  <p>  While the development of residential land in housing authority ownership is, in the first Instance, a matter for the local authority concerned, including its elected members, we need to see new social and affordable homes realised from State housing land without delay, with particular emphasis on prioritising sites, including those mentioned, with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale in the short to medium term.  Both sites fit into that category.  The issue is how we can develop them as quickly as possible.  Like others, I am frustrated by the lengthy delays in developing some of the sites.  We need to find ways to develop them a lot quicker.  <\/p>  <p>  St. Michael's estate is one of three significant sites being developed by Dublin City Council under its housing land initiative, the aim of which is to ensure the delivery of mixed tenure homes in the Dublin City Council functional area.  It envisages the potential to yield a minimum of 420 mixed tenure homes and the elected members of the council have determined that they will be provided on a 30% social, 20% affordable and 50% private tenure mix basis.  I understand a general discussion in that regard is under way.  Most people acknowledge the need to provide affordable, social and private housing.  I think I am correct in saying most Members present want to see some private housing on the sites mentioned, but the issue is who should build them.  Given the strategic importance of St. Michael's estate, my Department is working very closely with the city council on its optimum development.  I am conscious of the motion recently received from the city council which is being reviewed and discussed.  I was asked by Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin to meet the residents on the site, which I did.  The Minister was also asked to visit the site and did so earlier today when he met local residents.  I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss the matter with him.  It is a great site which is located beside the Luas and in the heart of the city.  We are all determined to deliver a top class housing project on it.<\/p>  <p>  Shanganagh Castle is another great site which is also located near amenities and public transport services.  It is very positive that the members of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have come together on a cross-party basis with a view to achieving the optimal outcome on the site which can deliver over 500 new homes on a mixed tenure basis.  I acknowledge that Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett has been campaigning on the issue for many years.  My Department has met council officials on a number of occasions, including on site, to discuss the optimum development approach.  Woodbrook-Shanganagh is a designated major urban housing delivery site and in recognition of this my Department is keen to support its development and has committed funding of just over &euro;4 million from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, to build public infrastructure which will open up the site for earlier development.<\/p>  <p>  On the delivery of affordable homes on the two sites, it is ultimately a matter for the elected members of the councils to decide whether the homes should be affordable for purchase or cost rental.  I firmly believe there is a need to ensure the rental sector, particularly in cities and major urban areas, is accessible and affordable.  We are all agreed that the sector is not where it needs to be.  To this end, we need to invest in a different rental offering, a so-called cost rental<\/p>  <p>sector which operates between the social and private market sectors.  We are learning from pilot projects and the examination of similar models elsewhere.  We are working with the European Investment Bank and other key stakeholders with a view to announcing shortly the first major cost rental project in Dublin city, with a broader programme of cost rental projects across Dublin and other cities to follow.  The key issue is how we can stretch available resources to maximise these public developments.

I am not particularly precious about whether it is mine or the other, but I do believe that they are important amendments.  The purpose is to restrict the profiling, harvesting and targeting of data on children by companies which advertise on social media.  This is vitally important, perhaps more important than some other measures that are considered in the Bill, if we are truly to protect children from harmful online marketing.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and the Fianna F&aacute;il health spokesperson stated as recently as Monday that they want to see children protected from such practices online.

I would love to hear the Minister's argument that this type of targeted and cynical direct marketing supersedes the health interests of the children of Ireland.  Without the amendment, sugary drinks, for example, and other harmful items and agendas such as those that promote a particular body image could be marketed directly at children in a very exploitative way.  This is in a context where the population in Ireland is set to be one of the most obese in Europe by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, young people are very exposed to data profiling and targeting by commercial organisations and businesses.  This needs to be tackled.  There are very serious risks in this regard, especially when marketing harmful goods or products or pushing a harmful agenda, such as making young people excessively conscious of their appearance and body.  We must tackle this issue, not only for children but for society as a whole.  The Cambridge Analytica story shows how these strategies can be used against us all.  Facebook has confirmed it has recently banned some 200 apps for that reason.  It shows the scale of the risks for us all.  Children, however, are particularly vulnerable.  Many children will not be aware how their actions online influence the adverts that they see, and they will not be aware of the extent to which their data is being gathered, the profile that is being built up on them and the way it is being used to exploit them.<\/p>  <p>  On the digital age of consent, Sinn F&eacute;in believes that 16 is a more appropriate age for young people to be in a position to make informed decisions about their safety and about the data that they are sharing.  Putting the digital age of consent at 16 is not a silver bullet but it means that children, in general, will have reached a greater level of maturity when making decisions about when and how they can share their data with companies.  Some commentary has intimated that perhaps the digital age of consent does something beyond that.  It relates specifically to the capacity to make decisions on sharing data.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a position we have arrived at lightly or without consideration.  We have engaged at length with people arguing for both perspectives.  I believe all concerned have the best interests of children at heart.  There are expert organisations with significant weight on both sides of the argument, which we have considered carefully.  On balance, however, it is Sinn F&eacute;in's view to err on the side of caution on the very important issue of the online safety of children and to favour 16 years of age as the age of digital consent.<\/p><p>We are conscious that this is not a silver bullet.  People have expressed concerns about a false sense of security.  I recognise their concerns.  Some of the responsibility for dispelling any such sense falls on all of us, but that can only happen if we allow it.  I urge those in the media who are covering this story not to mischaracterise it and to reflect upon the fact that much is still required if we are to ensure safety online, not only for children, but for us all.  I urge the media to inform parents not to take from this a false sense of security.  Parental discretion, oversight and education on social media remain crucial.  We favour this issue being kept under ongoing review.<\/p> <p> There remains the possibility of young people finding ways around this measure regardless of whether we set the age at 13 or 16 years.  Age verification processes are weak and many young people will simply lie to get around them.  We need to force companies to tighten up on age verification.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled amendments on micro-targeting of under 18s.  They are supported by the Irish Heart Foundation and many other organisations.  Our amendments would go a significant distance towards tackling the exploitative practices of many companies.  We also want to see progress on our Digital Safety Commissioner Bill, which passed Second Stage in 2017 and is awaiting Committee Stage.  In the context of the significant debate on online safety, I hope that the Government will provide a money message for the Bill if so required.  It is important legislation, there is broad consensus on its proposals and it is largely supported by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Setting up the office would provide national minimum digital safety standards, codes of conduct and certification of platforms and websites, and create for the first time a statutory body responsible for digital safety.<\/p> <p> In the context of a properly resourced digital safety commissioner, a ban on micro-targeting of under 18s and other measures to ensure proper online safety, we would be open to re-examining the digital age of consent, be that through a review built into statute or via other means.  At this juncture, however, it is our belief that it is best to err on the side of caution.  We will favour 16 years of age in the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600027#EE01600","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526477400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 aim to protect children older than the digital age of consent of 13 years but younger than 16 years of age from being targeted, including through the use of sophisticated means, by companies online in a marketing context.  The right decision is to have a digital age of consent of 13.  All of the child protection experts tell us that this is so if we are to vindicate the legal rights - that is what they are, not aspirations - of children to participate and to be heard.  These rights are enshrined in Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, and Article 24 of the EU charter.  Children also have rights to freedom of expression and assembly.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, it is less desirable that children should be micro-targeted by sophisticated algorithms designed to use their data to manipulate them.  Indeed, that would be undesirable in anyone's case.  Unfortunately, the GDPR does not give us that protection or the right to raise the bar for everyone, but we should at least do it in respect of children.  It is important that children are able to exercise their autonomy in using online services from the age of 13, but we should throw the onus back on the companies that would exploit their data for profit.  It is unrealistic to place another responsibility on parents by increasing the age of consent to 16.  The increase would run the risk of violating children's fundamental freedoms and create privacy risks for parents.  It would be far better if responsibility for policing platforms was placed on the providers, whose bread and butter is the kind of sharp practice we are trying to prevent.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 15 seeks to raise the digital age of consent from 13 years.  We agreed the current age on Committee Stage and strongly believe it should be retained.  We welcome the Social Democrats' move to a position of upholding the current age.  The heat and noise created around this issue by sections of the media are an indictment of the laziness of these individuals in their coverage of important matters.  The Bill has 162 pages, but all they can concentrate on is one line.  It is pathetic, given the ramifications.  A number of political contributions were slightly similar, but I mainly blame the media in this regard.  It is the modern equivalent of \"Just say no\" in respect of drugs and sex education and it denies our young people access to social media and the Internet.  They should be educated and enabled in taking a harm reduction approach.  Instead, we are perpetuating the myth that we can protect them, which is nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues that have been downplayed in this discussion is the question of how to go about verifying children's ages online.  It is significant that we thrash this out now, as raising the age of consent to 16 will bring many more children and websites into the dragnet.  How do we verify children's ages?  In the US, the COPPA Act has been in force for almost 20 years.  It obliges operators of child-focused websites to get verifiable parental consent to allow children under 13 years of age to use those websites.  In that sense, it is a more limited proposition than requiring parental consent for anyone under 16 years of age to access any commercial website.  Despite being narrower, COPPA has been subject to heavy criticism because of the privacy implications of obtaining verifiable parental consent.  In the US, ways of getting that consent include requiring a parent to scan and send a copy of his or her credit card or government-issued IDs, which would be held in a central database.  A few years ago, the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, approved the use of knowledge-based authentication for verifying children's ages online.  That is mad stuff.<\/p>  <p>  As should be clear, all of these methods of verifying parental consent are privacy nightmares and an opportunity to hoover up sensitive parental data.  As such, it is not surprising that, in the GCHQ's most recent Cyber Accelerator funding round, it provided a grant to a company called Trust Elevate that, according to itself, solved the problem of age verification and parental consent for young adults and children in online transactions.  Interestingly, Trust Elevate was recently recommended as a possible solution to online age verification by some of the loudest voices calling for the age of consent to be increased to 16, the same voices that told the Oireachtas committee that they believed that robust age verification online was one of the most crucial requirements.  It is not surprising that individuals with a security and intelligence background have an interest in getting people to reveal their identities online.<\/p>  <p>  If we want to protect children, we should be listening to the people whose primary focus is on doing just that.  Every single person and organisation involved in child protection has stated clearly that the current digital age of consent is the best option.  People from the security and intelligence industry undoubtedly have valid reasons for their emphasis, but those are not child protection reasons, so the House should not use them as an excuse to follow those people's arguments.<\/p>  <p>  The alternative to tight verification controls that hoover up large volumes of data are light controls, which are basically the type of box ticking seen with WhatsApp.  If people are asked whether they are over 16 years of age, they will tick the box to say they are.  That is it and good luck.  It is nonsense.  Who are we conning with this unenforceable digital age of consent?  It will have the downsides of denying young people access to important websites that could protect their interests and shutting down many child services out of fear of being implicated in data breaches.  It would be a nightmare, so we should uphold best practice and keep the digital age of consent at 13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600028#FF00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1526477400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Our amendment No. 15 substitutes &quot;16 years&quot; for &quot;13 years&quot;.<\/p><p>I have spoken on this issue on Second and Committee Stages so will not overly detain the House.  I have made clear that I favour a digital age of consent of 16.  The advocates for a digital age of consent of 13 have argued that children have a right to a voice online and to participation.  However, the digital age of consent applies only when the personal data of children is being gathered and processed.  Children under the digital age of consent should be provided with platforms that do not exploit their personal data as a condition of their use, which is particularly important for vulnerable younger children who should not have to rely on parental consent.  The issue here is the provision of safe spaces online that protect children's anonymity and platforms which do not profile them on the basis of personal data.  Relying on commercial platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others to provide such safe spaces or attempting to use them as such arguably put vulnerable children at risk.  Risk may also arise from an unintentional breach a child's anonymity, his or her targeting through advertising and marketing campaigns based on his or her interactions online or potential exposure to individuals online who might not have the child's best interests at heart.  I am speaking euphemistically there but people will understand to what I refer.  A digital age of consent of 16 would be in line with that in place in Germany, the Netherlands, France and other countries which have best-in-class approaches to protecting children online.  The political position in the Netherlands in adopting 16 as the digital age of consent was based on two simple principles: that parents must parent and that medical consent is granted at the age of 16 and, that being so, it followed that the digital age of consent was also set at 16.  Many parents with genuine concerns about the age being set at 13 have contacted me on this issue.<br\/><br\/>The Committee on Children and Youth Affairs had a discussion with Professor Barry O'Sullivan of University College Cork and Dr. Mary Aiken on this issue in the context of cybersecurity for children and young adults.  Professor O'Sullivan stated:<\/p><blockquote>For clarification, the digital age of consent is not about when a child can access the Internet, it is merely the age at which a child can consent to a profiling of their personal data and that is it.  It is not about access, it is just the age at which a child can say he or she is happy to be profiled by a social media company or by a game.  Notably, Ireland has opted for 13, the lowest age of digital consent allowed under the GDPR.  The Data Protection Bill 2018, which enshrines an Irish digital age of consent of 13, was submitted to the Seanad on 8 February 2018 and is currently under consideration.<\/blockquote><p>He further stated:  <\/p><blockquote>There is a need to stop conflating a child's right to access information online with the digital age of consent which specifically relates to the age at which a child can sign legal agreements with online service providers who gather, profile, sell, and commercialise personal data.  We both agree that this conflation has mis-stepped the entire debate on the digital age of consent in Ireland because people think it is about access when it is not.<\/blockquote><p>One could argue that the GDPR, which sets a digital age of consent of 16 but allows member states to lower it to 13 or otherwise, does not take account of the points dealt with by amendments Nos. 13 and 14.  Amendment No. 13 states: &quot;It shall be an offence under this Act for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child as defined by section 29 for the purposes of direct marketing, profiling or micro-targeting, for financial gain.&quot;  It would be useful to hear the Minister's justification for not having within the legislation very clearly delineated lines regarding the exploitation of children in terms of the use of their information for direct marketing or profiling purposes or for micro-targeting, as the amendment states.<br\/><br\/>One could argue the digital age of consent is a moot point because the age verification issues of which all Members are aware have not been resolved.  Members are quite tuned in to the fact that notwithstanding what we legislate for, anybody of any age will be able to access information and create false profiles.  However, on the balance of probability, to set the digital age of consent at 16, as is the case across Europe, would be the best possible course of action here.  A digital age of consent of 16 is the best of a bad set of choices in terms of seeking to provide some legal protection for those under the age of 16.  The issue of self-verification was also dealt with at the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  It was told that self-verification does not work but that there is potentially a role for Ireland to be a leader in that regard and that could be done through the Data Protection Commissioner and so on.<br\/><br\/>We intend to press amendment No. 15.  This is about legislating to provide maximum protection against the exploitation of children. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600028#FF00300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526478000,"counter":320,"content":"<p>The three amendments under discussion all seek to provide greater protection for children under the Bill.  Amendment No. 15 seeks to raise the age of digital consent from 13 to 16.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that Fianna F&aacute;il supports a digital age of consent of 16.  I will not address that amendment today as my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will do so.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to address amendments Nos. 13 and 14, which seek to provide greater protection for children by protecting them from micro-targeting and profiling.  All Members should support that objective provided it does not conflict with the provisions of the GDPR.  There is too much commercialisation that tries to target children with products such as fast food or particular games.  If we can, we should provide protection from such targeting.<\/p>  <p>  It is instructive to note that a child is defined in the Bill as a person under the age of 18, so amendments Nos. 13 and 14, if passed, would apply to all persons under the age of 18 rather than only those aged between 16 and 18.  I would rather support amendment No. 14 as tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire because I note he has removed from it the term \"for financial gain\" which caused me concern on Committee Stage.  I have a slight concern that the amendment only makes it an offence for a company or corporate body to engage in the micro-targeting or profiling of children.  Companies may be able to get around that by purchasing data from individuals who carry out the profiling and targeting of the personal data.  However, that is not sufficient reason for me to oppose the amendment.  If I oppose it, it will be for the reason I gave on Committee Stage, when the Minister indicated that the amendment would constitute a breach of EU law because it would impose a limitation on the type of processing of personal data that is permitted under the GDPR.  The Minister stated on Committee Stage that the State would be exposed to infringement proceedings and that had an impact on me.<\/p><p> Following Committee Stage I went back and had a look at the issues in respect of the GDPR.  What we need to recognise is that we have limitations imposed upon us in the Oireachtas when we are debating the Data Protection Bill.  The reason we have limitations is because the Bill itself seeks to give further effect to a regulation - the GDPR - that we know will come into effect on Friday week.  No matter what we do, the GDPR is coming into effect on Friday week.  It does not need to be transposed into Irish law because it will become a part of Irish law on Friday week.  The Data Protection Bill also has other provisions in it which seek to give effect to other directives.  The issue that causes concern is whether the amendments are consistent with the GDPR.  If they are consistent with the GDPR, then I and Fianna F&aacute;il will support them.<\/p> <p> I went back and had a look at the GDPR and it is instructive to note that it does give very special recognition to the protection required for children.  Recital 38 says that children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data.  The other relevant recital is recital 47 to which the Minister referred.  This indicates that the legitimate interests of a controller may provide a legal basis for processing, and therefore the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.<\/p> <p> We then need to look at the other recital that deals specifically with profiling, and that is recital 71.  It says that a data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based on profiling.  An issue that arises is whether amendment No. 14 will have the effect of constituting a decision that is created by profiling.  It is also instructive to note that recital 71 says that such measures which are introduced should not concern a child.  The recitals are very clear.  They want to provide protection for children.  They also recognise that certain types of processing are legitimate.  Article 4 in the GDPR makes clear that profiling is a form of processing.  It is described as any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person.<\/p> <p> The Minister has relied on Article 6 on numerous occasions.  Article 6.1(f) states that one lawful basis for processing is where processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.  Again, the GDPR gives express recognition to the vulnerability of children and the fact that they are deserving of special protection under the regulations and under any transpositive laws that are introduced in member states.<\/p> <p> Article 22 refers to automated individual decision-making, including profiling.  It says the data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on profiling.  That will not apply, for instance, if it is authorised by the Union or member state law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests.<\/p> <p> I and Fianna F&aacute;il want to support amendment No. 14 but we do not want to expose Ireland to infringement proceedings down the road.  I have had another look at the GDPR and it seems to be that the protection of children is very much at the forefront of the recitals in the GDPR and indeed in respect of certain articles.  What the Minister has to do is satisfy my colleagues and me that if we introduce the amendment, we will not be in flagrant breach of the articles contained within the GDPR.  It does not stand out that that is the case but I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say as that will very much dictate how Fianna F&aacute;il votes in respect of the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600029#GG00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526478600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on the amendment relating to the digital age of consent.

There is no argument about raising the digital age of consent, but the proposal from the Government, supported by Independents 4 Change and some other Deputies, is that we would reduce the age to 13.  The truth is that there is very little evidence that one age is better than another.  The precautionary approach must be that we would go for the highest age, which is the standard age favoured by Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries because that is the default age in the GDPR.  The GDPR requirement for parental consent for processing does not apply to preventative or counselling services, so the concerns that have been raised by some in terms of whether children will be able to get access to the services they need in that regard is not an issue.  That is covered by the GDPR and it is covered by the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a review built into the legislation that the Minister introduced relating to the age of 13, and that is welcome but it could also apply to the age of 16 so that if there are unintended consequences, there would be a review.

There is very little empirical evidence on either side and the position that we have taken is to take the precautionary approach, namely, to opt for the standard, which is the older age.  This is about the processing of data and the profiling of data subjects who happen to be children.  It is not about giving them access to services online.  That is the truth of it.

We should also admit that there are some organisations that are very vocal on this issue, whom I am sure are worthy organisations, but they are sponsored by tech companies or some members of their boards of directors are employees of tech companies.

The digital age of consent has been the subject of considerable debate in the Oireachtas.  Many child protection experts, psychologists, mental health specialists and those working on the front line with children have expressed the strong view that the age of digital consent should be set at 13 years.  There are compelling child protection reasons for this being the best option to keep children safe online.  We need to face the reality that our children will be accessing online information and using Internet enabled devices from a young age but by reducing the age of digital consent, we are providing more protection for our children.<\/p>  <p>  The draft scheme of the Bill as published last year did not make provision for representative action to be taken.  There was much debate on this issue during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage and the Bill has now shifted quite a bit.  It now permits a data subject to mandate a not-for-profit body to lodge complaints with the data protection commission.  A mandated, not-for-profit body may also bring a civil claim on behalf of a data subject before the courts.  However, such a body will not be able to claim compensation on behalf of data subjects.  In effect, a not-for-profit body will be able to seek injunctive relief but not damages on the data subject's behalf.  The Bill does not address how the rules and regulations on legal costs will apply to actions taken by non-profit bodies.  In particular, guidance will be needed on whether a court can award costs against the data subject as well as the non-profit body in the event of an unsuccessful civil claim.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies, we possibly need to be educated further on the issue of data protection.  How are we, as politicians, going to cope with this new data protection regime?  We are finding it more difficult to access information as it stands.  Sometimes bodies or individuals hide behind data protection and use it as a handy way to get rid of one or not to give one an answer.  That is a very serious issue and a worry for politicians.<\/p>  <p>  On the positive side, I visited Spearline last Friday, a west Cork technology firm based in Skibbereen.  This company is a huge asset to the local community.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Pat Breen, launched the first phase of the company's development.  The company will employ up to 60 people in its new risk compliance and data protection division.  Spearline will also produce a new line of software called Spearline Data Protection which will focus on supporting organisations and data protection officers in meeting the requirements of GDPR that are due to come into effect on 25 May this year.  Spearline is a wonderful example of why we need a Data Protection Bill.  Not only will this Bill protect people in the context of data usage and storage, it will also create many jobs across the country in towns like Skibbereen, thus keeping rural communities alive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600031#JJ00100","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I want to talk about the digital age of consent and whether it should be set at 16 or 13.  I strongly believe that it needs to be set at 16 but I acknowledge that everybody in this debate, including the Minister and others who are advocating setting it at 13, wants to act in the best interests of young people and provide them with the best protection.  Some of the debate has been fractious, which is unfortunate but nobody engaged in this debate has anything but the best of intentions for the children involved.<\/p>  <p>  Should the age of consent be set at 16, 13 or somewhere in between?  As Deputies Thomas Byrne and O'Callaghan have pointed out, Fianna F&aacute;il's position is that it should be set at 16.  I support that position and want to explain why.  The question that the Minister, in advocating for 13, will have to answer is whether 13 or 14 year olds should have to consent to being profiled by Internet companies and to sharing their online activity including text messages, photographs and location with service providers.  Should they, for example, consent to Facebook permanently owning all of the photographs they put up online and all of their location information?  Should they consent to companies psychologically profiling them based on their use of applications and then using their images, online behaviour, location and demographics to target them and sell to them?  That is what the online providers want to do because that is how they make money and stay in business.  The industry wants the age of consent to be 13 because it wants to be able to tell potential advertisers that young people aged 13 or 14 have said that they consent to technology companies having full access to their photographs, contacts, text messages, location, everything they like, dislike or express a view on; to being profiled; to being sold stuff; and to the selling of the information gathered about them to other third party providers.  That is what the technology companies would like because they will make more money that way.  Should 13 to 15 year olds have to consent to being profiled as products in order to be able to use Teamer or WhatsApp or any other application?  No, they should not have to do that.<\/p>  <p>  The argument I have heard from those advocating 13 as the age of digital consent is that if we opt for 16, the service providers will argue that no-one using their platform is below the age of 16 and will create an environment or platform that is only suitable for those aged 16 and over.  The suggestion is that 13 to 15 year olds will still access those platforms and that therefore, we are implicitly accepting that 13 to 15 year olds will end up on platforms that the service providers have designed for those aged 16 and over.  They will be accessing inappropriate platforms.  That is one argument.  The other argument is that if the above does not happen, the 13 to 15 year olds will be locked out of the platforms or services.  The evidence provided for this argument is WhatsApp saying that it will not let 13 to 15 year olds access its product.  The argument is that if the digital age of consent changes to 16, service providers will not provide a service for younger people.  Do 13 to 15 year olds have the right to engage in online activity and to communicate with their friends through social media applications?  Of course they have that right.  Let us follow the argument through.  Let us say we opt for 16, which I hope we do for all of the right reasons.  The argument is that then a bunch of 13 year olds will go onto sites or platforms and be exposed to an inappropriate environment.  If that happens regulators, parents, consumer groups, politicians and journalists will be all over those applications very quickly.  We know that they need good publicity and are sensitive to how they are portrayed.  We have just seen Facebook and Google pull back from running referendum advertisements in Ireland.  We would have to believe that service providers would knowingly allow 13 year olds onto platforms designed for those aged 16 and over and would be okay with taking that risk.  They would not be okay with that and those dumb enough to take such a risk would very quickly be found out and shut down.  That is what happens if there is non-verification of 13 year olds.<\/p>  <p>  If there is verification, the argument is that the 13 to 15 year olds will be locked out of applications like Teamer or WhatsApp.  However, for that to be true, we would have to believe that we live in a world where another service provider would not immediately move in and offer an age appropriate platform to 13 to 15 year olds.  That age cohort is the fastest growing consumer group for digital platforms so it is simply not credible that if 13 to 15 year olds are locked out of current platforms that age-appropriate equivalents will not be provided immediately.  In fact, what will happen is that those companies that say they will not provide access to their application to those under 16 will actually do so.  They will do it very quickly and will do it for all of the countries that opt for a digital age of consent of 16 because if they do not, they will be turning their backs on the biggest consumer group in the country for no good reason.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat that I believe everyone is coming at this with the best interests of young people at heart.<\/p><p>I believe the arguments put forward for the relevant age to be 13 simply do not stack up against reality.  The best way to ensure young people are suitably protected from having to give up ownership of their texts, photos and online activity to companies so that they can be profiled and sold to, while still having access to an online world, is to set the age at 16.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600031#JJ00200","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526479800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this Bill and particularly on amendments Nos. 14 and 15.  Amendment No. 14 reads:<\/p><blockquote>In page 28, after line 34, to insert the following:&quot;Micro-targeting and profiling of children<br \/><br \/>30. It shall be an offence under this Act for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child as defined by section 29 for the purposes of direct marketing, profiling or micro-targeting.  Such an offence shall be punishable by an administrative fine under section 140.&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>While I accept the argument underpinning that amendment, I have to point out that fines often do not mean an awful lot to big technology companies.  They are so wealthy and have so much turnover that fines often do not punish them in a proper way.  It is probable that &quot;punish&quot; is the wrong word, so I will say instead that fines do not have much of an impact on their balance sheets.  Amendment No. 15, in the names of Deputies Sherlock, O'Callaghan and Thomas Byrne, reads:<\/p><blockquote>In page 29, line 2, to delete &quot;13 years&quot; and substitute &quot;16 years&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>As we all know, the issue of data protection must be addressed as we contend with the ever-expanding powers of social media platforms and online companies.  Deputy Donnelly has referred to the impact of the decision made by Google and Facebook to shut down certain activities during the ongoing referendum campaign.  It is strange that they have not made the same decision when other elections have been taking place across Europe since the 2016 US election.  I have issues in that regard.<\/p><p>In an article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>last week, Charlie Weston provided an excellent example of the issues we are talking about when he revealed that &quot;the AIB banking group has been accused of playing Big Brother with its customers after it emerged that it spies on customers' social media accounts&quot;.  I remind the Minister that we owned over 90% of this bank after we bailed it out some years ago.  Mr. Weston pointed out that &quot;the lender is trawling through Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media accounts held by customers for comments on its service&quot;.  As the service is now pretty unfriendly to customers, the comments are not going to be very good.  When one tries to meet a teller, one has to deal with a machine.  Mr. Weston's article continued:<\/p><blockquote>The bank tells customers that the move &quot;helps us understand your behaviour&quot; [how ironic].  As part of the mortgage application process, customers are now required to sign a consent form, which gives permission for a range of things, such as a credit check, to be carried out on them and to allow their social media accounts to be looked at by the bank.  It applies to those seeking mortgages with AIB [which does not give many of them anyway] and its subsidiaries, EBS and Haven.  AIB Group is 71pc-owned by the State and is the Republic's biggest mortgage lender.  Mortgage broker Karl Deeter accused the bank of invading the privacy of customers by spying on them.  He said: &quot;I'm confident that people would not be comfortable knowing that the bank can play Big Brother with their social media information.&quot;  Mr Deeter, of Irish Mortgage Brokers, said it wasn't clear if someone who posts on Facebook that they attend the likes of anti-eviction protests would end up having a mortgage application refused if the bank was to see this.<\/blockquote><p>Of course such an application would be refused because the bank would have to help its friends.<\/p><p>In my capacity as a Member of the Oireachtas, I recently attended an excellent briefing provided by Dr. Mary Aiken and Professor Barry O'Sullivan on the digital age of consent.  I would like to quote from an email that was sent by Dr. Aiken on behalf of herself and Professor O'Sullivan this morning:<\/p><blockquote>As you know there will a vote this afternoon regarding the Irish Digital Age of Consent.  We take the opportunity to clarify:<br \/><br \/>- The Digital Age of Consent is about protecting the\u00a0personal data of children.<br \/><br \/>- This issue is\u00a0not about\u00a0when children can go online.<br \/><br \/>- Parents have the right to\u00a0parent their children.<br \/><br \/>In two years of campaigning on this issue, every parent we have spoken to supports a Digital Age of Consent of 16.  I am a Cyberpsychologist, Prof. O'Sullivan is a Data Scientist we are internationally\u00a0recognised\u00a0experts in this area - we strongly support 16.<\/blockquote><p>I expect that everyone is coming at this from a different angle, but the email from which I have quoted sets out the factual situation as far as I understand it.  The email had to be sent out after very unfair allegations were put in the public domain by opponents of Dr. Aiken and Professor O'Sullivan.  After I brought this matter to the attention of those who made the allegations, they sent out an apology and took down the allegations.  If they had not done so, they would rightly be dealing with litigation and facing Deputy O'Callaghan or one of his colleagues.  One is entitled to one's good name.  The email sent by Dr. Aiken and Professor O'Sullivan, in which they say they &quot;believe that the vast majority of parents of Ireland want 16 as a Digital Age of Consent, as do the teachers, the Garda&iacute;\u00a0and\u00a0doctors of Ireland&quot;, makes it perfectly clear what is at stake here.  The harvesting of children's data is not something we should actively encourage and promote, but that is exactly what this Bill will allow.  For that reason, as I have said, I will be opposing the Bill and supporting those who are seeking to set the digital age of consent at 16.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600032#KK00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600032#KK00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l m&eacute; cr&iacute;ochnaithe f&oacute;s, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

People have come at this issue from different angles.  I accept everyone's bona fides in this regard.  As legislators, we have to make a choice when we are dealing with and voting on these two amendments.  I appeal to the Minister to show understanding to the people who are here.  There is a big difference between processing and profiling, or between profiling and processing.  It is a question of use and abuse.  We can never be too aware of how data is used nowadays.  Those between the ages of 13 and 16 comprise the fastest-growing market.  My children have just come through those years.  My youngest child is 16.  I understand totally that they want to be on these platforms.  Being on them is one thing, but their personal data should not be allowed to be compiled, processed, used and misused.  I believe the potential for misuse and abuse of their data is what we are talking about.  I am concerned about these issues.  I do not want to see Ireland being ridiculed for being out of kilter with many other countries in not taking the opportunity to safeguard our children's data.  It is for this reason that I am supporting these amendments and opposing the Government's stated position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600032#KK01000","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>When this Bill was discussed in the Seanad and when it went through the rigorous select committee process, I explained comprehensively the consultation processes that resulted in the Government proposing a digital age of consent of 13 years.  I do not propose to repeat those points this afternoon, not least because I thought the argument in favour of 13 being set as the relevant age was well made by Deputy Shortall in her constructive contribution last night.  She outlined the reasons that a digital age of consent of 13 years will serve to protect children.<\/p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to say I fully agree with the contribution of Deputy Clare Daly.  I am seldom in a position to say that.  I agree with the really good case she made.  I also agree with what Deputy Wallace has said on this issue.  I will add to what they said by making the point that Ireland's decision to choose 13 years as our digital age of consent is firmly in line with many other EU member states, including Denmark, Sweden and Finland.  We look to these countries, more than most, for examples of good practice in the areas of child support and child protection.  Countries like Latvia and Estonia can also be regarded as examples of good practice.  Estonia perhaps gives more Government time to issues of e-activity, e-learning and e-government than any other EU member state.  Our neighbours in the UK have also opted for 13 years as the digital age of consent, as have Spain and Portugal.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge that there has been a rigorous process going back over a number of years.  This has included the process of pre-legislative scrutiny on the part of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which comprises Deputies and Senators of all parties and none.<\/p><p>There was also the matter of the public consultation which fed into the decision of Government.  Through the Seanad, Committee Stage and now Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, this was not done lightly and it was not a decision taken without due careful and comprehensive consideration.<\/p> <p> If I may now focus on amendments Nos. 13 and 14 tabled by Deputies Clare Daly, Wallace, Shortall and &Oacute; Laoghaire, these amendments seek to criminalise the processing of children's personal data for direct marketing and profiling purposes.  I wish to state again that while I am sympathetic to their objective, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.  As Deputy Wallace stated last night, the processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called \"legitimate interests\" ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, and recital 47 states this particularly.  During the select committee meetings, we addressed the issue of whether national law can impose additional conditions on processing carried out under the data protection directive.  The court underlined the importance of free movement of personal data under the 1995 directive and concluded categorically that member states could not add new principles or impose additional conditions that have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds in Article 7 of the directive.  Put simply, the imposition of prohibitions in national law on the processing of personal data that is lawful under the GDPR, or the criminalisation of processing that is lawful under the GDPR, will be in breach of EU law.  I think Deputy O'Callaghan acknowledged this.  If he was not convinced, he certainly saw the difficulty.  The State will be exposed to infringement proceedings and possible sanctions.  We all know what that means.<\/p> <p> I draw attention to the important difference between the wording of \"legitimate interests\" in Article 6 and the text of Article 7(f) of the 1995 directive.  In the 1995 directive, Article 7 states that the personal data may be processed where necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedom of the data subject.  The corresponding text in the GDPR contains an important addition, namely, \"in particular where the data subject is a child\".  Taken together with the statement in recital 38 that children merit specific and special protection with regard to personal data because they may be less aware of risks or consequences and safeguards concerning their rights in respect of the processing of data, we can see that the GDPR itself imposes stricter conditions, which is worthy of consideration.<\/p> <p> I share the concerns expressed by Deputies during earlier debate in respect of child protection.  For that very reason, I have introduced section 31 providing for codes of conduct with regard to the processing of personal data of children for the purposes of direct marketing.  I said on previous occasions that I expect this issue to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  In the light of concerns expressed here again, I assure the House that I will make early contact with Commissioner Jourov&aacute; requesting the Commission to do all in its power to advance child protection issues.  I met her last year.  I will convey to her the concerns that have been expressed here on all sides of the House.<\/p> <p> I am satisfied that it would not be in the interests of child protection to insert the section concerned into the Bill.  The inclusion of provisions designed to criminalise processing that may be lawful under the GDPR would expose the State to infringement proceedings and distract attention from the overriding issues of child protection which have been amplified here by everybody on all sides.  I agree with the Deputies.  As far as the exposure of the State is concerned, it is not just my view nor that of my officials and Department but also the firm view of the Attorney General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600032#KK01100","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526480400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>On the digital age of consent, I do not think the full picture has been given in terms of the public consultation.

There were other submissions arguing for 16, as has been mentioned, by Professors Aiken and O'Sullivan along with others.  Since that public consultation, we do know that other organisations have contacted the Department.  I raised a question last night in the D&aacute;il as to why these have not been put on the record.

There is no doubt that we can properly choose to protect children by having the digital age of consent at 16, as it is in the regulation the Europeans have set for us.  The Minister has helpfully listed countries that are going for 13.  We have also listed large and important countries that are going for 16.

We all share the same objective.  The question is as to the best way to do that.  We cannot ignore the very strong representations we have heard from Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance and the ISPCC.  They make a number of very cogent points.  The predominant point is that raising the age of consent to 16, or whatever age, does give a false sense of security that it solves the problem when we know that simply is not the case.  This is a once-off action a parent takes in handing over consent.  If they say no, it means the child is denied access to that platform.  If they say yes, which an awful lot of parents will do because they do not know what they are handing over, that is a problem also.  If we recognise that it is a reality that many children lie online, we have to accept that it is a significant factor.  Children also have ways around age verification mechanisms.  If we are serious about curtailing and preventing the micro-targeting of children for commercial purposes, we have to restrict the ability of companies to target children and harvest their data.<\/p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, the Minister rejected similar amendments to this.  The amendments we have tabled, however, are not an additional condition of a new principle.  They are within the scope of both EU jurisprudence and the GDPR.  Article 6.1(f) states that processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.  I would contend that the Minister is perfectly within the law to make it an offence for companies to engage in what they are doing at the moment, namely, the relentless targeting of children for commercial purposes whether it is in respect of junk food, alcohol, or gambling and other things.  It is that practice that we need to outlaw.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600033#LL00500","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1526480400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Article 8 of the GDPR deals with the issue of consent to the processing of personal data in connection with what we call information society services.

I do not believe we should legislate on the basis that we know that children will lie about the age they give in the age verification process.  We have to legislate on the basis of what we believe to be the correct course of action.

The Minister's opposition to the amendments on micro-targeting and the profiling of under-18s is based primarily on an argument made that there can be no amendments to the principles outlined in EU data protection law.  This legislation is not simply a transposition of the GDPR.  It is more than that.  It is a directive which has direct effect in many aspects.  However, this is Irish primary legislation.  If the amendment was tabled to other legislation which had nothing to do with the director of regulation, would the same principle apply?  There is nothing in the GDPR that prevents the Government and Parliament from making amendments of this kind.  The GDPR will come to pass and stand.  This legislation is likely to be passed.  Ultimately, we have the right and authority to legislate, not beyond EU law but within its constraints.  There is nothing in the GDPR which prevents us from providing stand-alone legislation.

All kids, 13 years and under, use it.  Those who are in denial should cop themselves on.  The reason most countries have moved to an age lower than 16 years is they are concerned that valuable websites will be denied to young people as it is unclear what services would fall under the term &quot;information society services&quot;.  It is absolute nonsense to claim consenting to have one's data profiled is a link with some evil social media website.  It could also very much cover educational websites and so on.<\/p><p>Members have spoken about striking a balance in the debate.  If one looks at this as a seesaw, all of the weight of the argument is on one side.  It is very interesting how the debate has changed since earlier times.  It is very suspicious and weird and I have never seen the likes of it.  On one side, we have a section of the media, a few politicians, some of whom have changed their minds - I am not talking about the Social Democrats - a data analytics entrepreneur, an adviser to Interpol, Europol, the FBI and Paladin Capital Group.  The latter is a government security and intelligence focused venture capital firm headed by the former deputy director of the NSA.  On the other side, we have every single child protection organisation in the State, namely, the ISPCC, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Children's Rights Alliance, the special rapporteur for children, the Ombudsman for Children, Cyberspace Ireland, <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>, the president and president-elect of the Psychological Society of Ireland, the director of the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre, the UNESCO chair for children, youth and civil engagement and a variety of senior clinical psychologists.  It is not surprising that individuals with a security and intelligence background would have an interest in getting people to reveal their identities.  If we are all in favour of child protection, I will side with the child protection experts and go for a digital age of consent of 13 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600034#MM00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1526481000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>We accept that most children will get around the age verification step easily.  We should not set up a system which will encourage kids to lie.  It will simply encourage them to hide their online activity from their parents and not seek help and support.  It will undermine the ability of parents to engage with their children on their online activity to teach them critical thinking skills in the digital world.  A 2015 report, Net Children Go Mobile, found that 40% of children in Ireland under 11 and 12 years of age had a social networking account, despite the fact that social networking sites had an age restriction of 13 years.  We already have age restrictions that do not work and this will only create a false impression of safety online.<\/p>  <p>  If the digital age of consent is set at 16 years, online platforms will be able to argue that their spaces are for older teenagers and adults and simply reduce their protections accordingly.  We can create a digital safety programme through education, as suggested by the ISPCC, the Ombudsman for Children and others, through the establishment of an office of digital safety commissioner with statutory powers to regulate and educate about the online space.  As the director of the National Youth Council of Ireland, Ms Mary Cunningham, said a few days ago, learning to cross the road is far more useful than hoping for a ban on cars.  In the same way, education and a focus on developing critical thinking will be far more useful tools for young people and the adults in their lives than an increased digital age of consent which risks providing a false sense of security.<\/p>  <p>  The justice committee heard from many experts in the area.  Its Chairman, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, fully agrees with the digital age of consent being set at 13 years.

I am not a Eurosceptic, but it does reveal the extent to which we operate with limited sovereignty when it comes to certain parts of this legislation.  I support amendments Nos. 13 and 14 as they are sensible.  The only point which would block me supporting them is if they would be in breach of the GDPR if inserted into legislation.  We cannot introduce an amendment which would be in breach of the GDPR.<\/p>  <p>  During the course of my earlier contribution I went through the different recitals and articles in the GDPR which were relevant.  I regret to say I have not got huge satisfaction from the Minister.  He said it would subject it to infringement proceedings.  When one looks at Article 6, however, it is the basis of the Minister's contention.  He has said processing is lawful if it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or third party.  That is expressly set down in Article 6(1)(f).  It continues to state processing is not legitimate if it is the case that \"interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child\".<\/p><p>I believe we are entitled to introduce protection where the interests of a child are at stake.

I have a great deal of respect for Deputy Daly as a parliamentarian but she has scurrilously discredited one of the people arguing for a digital age of consent of 16 years in her contribution.  She said everyone agreed with her.  Then, she presented one substantive argument to the effect that people who are 13, 14 or 15 years of age will be locked out of the applications but they have a right to those applications.  This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the marketplace.  It assumes that if WhatsApp or an educational software platform decides only to provide for those aged 16 years and upwards, then those aged 13, 14 and 15 years will not quickly have access to similar products designed for them.  That is simply not the case.  Let us suppose we were having an argument about whether we should have an age of eligibility to buy alcohol.  The argument would be that we should not set the age at 18 years but at 13 years because we do not want children to lie about their age.  The thinking is that if the age limit is set at 18 years, then no drinks will be offered that are appropriate to those aged 13 or 14 years.  That is the analogy and it simply does not stack up.<\/p>  <p>  It is all well and good standing up under privilege, as Deputy Daly has done, and making serious allegations about someone who, for the very best of reasons, is advocating an age of consent of 16 years.  It is easy to stand up under D&aacute;il privilege and make the kind of accusations Deputy Daly has made but the only substantive argument she made was that younger children will be locked out.  They will not.  Therefore, the digital age of consent of 16 years should stand.

In most public consultations many people do not get involved.  They might miss the deadlines because of the way they are advertised and so on.  It could be a simple thing relating to a road or something as serious as this.  People simply do not see these things.  We are all so busy in our lives and we do not see them.

Deputies have talked about secrecy of the public consultation process.  I wish to make clear that many people made a contribution or provided input during the public consultation process.  In all cases, their documentation was received and duly given careful consideration.  All submissions made to the Department during the course of public consultation are on the website.  There should be no issue regarding secrecy or implications that follow therefrom by way of question mark.  The submissions are all on the Department website.  I am happy to state that by way of confirmation for Deputy McGrath.  Once again he wishes to introduce some cloud and fog into the process.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan commented on amendments Nos. 13 and 14 in particular.  A code of conduct can guide interpretation of Article 6(1)(f) but there is no reference in this provision to national law.  Indeed, the court has already found that member states are unable to or cannot limit the scope of the provision.  Deputy O'Callaghan stated that he was not a Eurosceptic but that he has a difficulty about relinquishing of national sovereignty.  I look at it differently.  I look at the pooling of sovereignty and the influence we can bring to bear to ensure that what we wish to do in terms of child protection can have EU-wide effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600035#NN00900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1526481600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

With this amendment, we are proposing that any regulations made under the section in order to either identify suitable and specific measures that have to be used in certain situations or to specify that some of those measures are mandatory shall first identify different measures for different categories of personal data, different categories of controllers and so on and, second, specify that at least one of the measures set out in the list in subsection 35(1) is mandatory.  We think it is important that regulations in this regard are obligated to be fairly clear and detailed.  That is because those measures are a requirement in so many different processing situations throughout the Bill and because they are so crucial to safeguarding people's rights and their data, the rules around them should therefore be pretty precise.  In other words, those rules should take into account what kinds of data are being processed, by whom and what kinds of processing actions are being taken on them.  We also think it is important that at least one, but ideally more, of the measures listed in section 35 have to be made mandatory if a Minister is going to the trouble of drawing up regulations and the measures listed in subsection 35(1) are fairly basic.  It should not be a major cross to bear to make at least one of them mandatory.<\/p><p>I will give a very brief example.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that schools hold data on children's allergies and other health issues so obliging them to implement limitations on access would be too onerous.  Flipping that around, it implies the Minister is okay with any visitor to the school getting access to highly sensitive information about a young child's health.  We do not really think in that context access limitations are too onerous at all.  It would be great to think that regulations were mandatory in this particular context.  To give another example, I recently heard of one school where staff were told the GDPR means the school has to hang on to permissions slips for school tours until the children are 21.  It is utter madness.  There is a huge misunderstanding out there.  Targeted training is another measure listed in subsection 35(1).  It should be made mandatory in certain contexts because we are opening the road to utter chaos otherwise.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600038#QQ00100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1526483400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I am unable to accept the amendment which, as we said earlier, arises out of something of a misreading of the purpose of subsection 35(4).

We should not, for example, give marketing companies working on non-statutory schemes such exemptions from the requirement to obtain consent.  It is not too difficult simply to require such third parties working on non-statutory projects to obtain consent to process personal data.  On Committee Stage the Minister defended this part of the Bill by saying that section 37(1)(b) was necessary for non-statutory schemes such as the free fuel scheme, free travel scheme and the back to school clothing allowance.  Surely these schemes are already provided for in the GDPR under Article 6.1.(f) and the idea there of &quot;legitimate interests&quot;.  Nobody is going to dispute that the processing of data for the free fuel scheme is a legitimate interest as per the GDPR.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 21 seeks to limit the purposes for which personal data that is collected can be processed by insisting that the purposes be specified at the outset which is listed in Article 23 of the GDPR as a specific provision that any legislative measure referred to in Article 23 shall contain.  This section refers to personal data processed in the public interest which according to Article 6 of the GDPR allows the data controller to bypass the consent of the data subject.  There will be times when such bypassing of consent will be necessary and that is why the GDPR provides for such occasions.  We have already expressed some concern about section 37(1)(b) and said on Committee Stage that we were very open to Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal to oppose the section as it seeks to carve out exemptions to the GDPR that exceed what the GDPR allows.  Processing of data for purposes other than the purpose for which that data is collected is prohibited except in very limited circumstances such as preventing a threat to national security.  Insisting that the purposes for which data is collected be specified at the outset in regulations made under section 37(4) is a sensible provision and would protect against processing for other or unspecified purposes in the public interest.  I acknowledge that section 37(5)(c) provides for a Minister to impose other conditions on processing which he or she see as appropriate while such conditions would not be mandatory.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 22 is an attempt to introduce an extra layer of protection which is necessary given the wideranging powers section 37 gives to Ministers.  We have concerns about the whole section.  The lines we seek to insert are taken from section 48 of the Bill which itself borrows heavily for its wording from the GDPR.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 seek to limit ministerial powers in terms of processing data in the so-called public interest.  As I said on Second Stage the public services card project and more important, the single customer view behind it is the largest data sharing project in the history of the State and has massive problems.  It shows clearly the liberties successive Governments in various Departments have already taken in sharing data in the so-called public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600039#RR00600","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1526483700,"counter":397,"content":"<p>In respect of amendment No. 18, on Committee Stage when the Minister listed the free fuel and travel schemes and the school meals programmes, operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on a non-statutory basis, he said that this processing complies with the GDPR because Recital 41 states: &quot;Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament&quot; each time.  If this processing is compliant with the GDPR why do we need section 37(1)(b)?  The GDPR already has direct application and if the Department's administration of these non-statutory schemes is already compliant we do not need anything in the Bill to make them compliant.  Therefore, we are a bit suspicious about why this clause is there.  Is the Minister trying to provide cover for an issue that might not necessarily be compliant, as in the instance given by Deputy Wallace where the public services card is required to obtain a passport which is non-statutory?  That might be called into question because the processing is of questionable legality.  Is the Minister trying to make it legal with this clause?  We would be concerned about that.<\/p><p>Under the old Data Protection Acts there was a specific exemption for the non-statutory schemes cited by the Minister but it was much more narrowly drawn than this one.  There was also an exemption in the old Data Protection Acts to allow processing of personal data for the performance of any other function of a public nature performed in the public interest by a person.  This is broadly similar to what is permitted under the GDPR.  We think it a bit odd that this Bill wants to diminish data protection rights relative to our law and European law rather than bring them up to the standard we are obliged to do.<\/p><p>Deputy Wallace dealt with amendment No. 21 about purpose limitation, one of the fundamental principles relating to processing of personal data laid out in Article 5.

That is all we want to do there.<\/p><p>Section 22, as Deputy Wallace said, is lifted from section 48.

All of these schemes do now, and will continue to, require the processing of personal data, and that processing is compliant with GDPR.  Recital 41 states that where the GDPR refers to a legal basis \"this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by parliament\".  I am sure Members will agree that these schemes, and other similar non-statutory measures, such as schemes to assist victims of flooding and of the recent fodder shortage, can be administered pretty quickly without the need to have a statutory basis.

I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 25, 51, 68 and 71 which have been tabled by Deputies Clare Daly, Mick Wallace and Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire and which propose the deletion of sections 38(2), 47, 57 and 58, respectively, as I believe these sections contain appropriate and proportionate measures to facilitate the smooth operation of our democratic system and to allow elected representatives in the State to maintain contact with and serve the electorate.  This is a fundamental duty in our membership of the House.<b><\/b>As amendments Nos. 57 and 58, in the name of Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, appear to be alternatives, I am also unable to accept either of them. <\/p><p>Turning to the amendments tabled by Deputy Thomas Byrne, while I am very favourably disposed towards their objective, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that they may not be GDPR-compliant and that, furthermore, they may be open to legal challenge, which is a concern.  The key changes proposed by the Deputy are replacement of all references to &quot;electoral activities&quot; with &quot;political activities&quot;; insertion of a non-exhaustive definition of &quot;political activities&quot;; the introduction of an additional condition in relation to representations made on behalf of data subjects who, by reason of physical or mental incapacity, are unable to do so themselves; the introduction of a further, potentially limiting, condition for elected representatives in responding to requests and representations in section 39(4); and replacement of section 38(3) with looser security conditions in a new subsection (6).<\/p><p>On the first change proposed, section 6A(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Data Protection Act 1988 which is carried over in section 58 of the Bill restricts the right to object to processing carried out in the course of electoral activities.  Recital 56 of the GDPR also refers to processing personal data in the course of electoral activities.  The risk is that replacing the reference to &quot;electoral activities&quot; which is in the current law and the GDPR with a reference to &quot;political activities&quot; would result in uncertainty and might give rise to legal challenges based on an apparent non-compliance with the GDPR. <\/p><p>On the second change proposed, inclusion of a non-exhaustive definition of &quot;political activities&quot; would cut across Article 9.2(<i>d<\/i>) of the GDPR which is directly applicable and does not require transposition into national law.  It permits, among other things, the processing of personal data, including special categories of personal data, during the course of its legitimate activities by a political party where the processing relates to members, former members or those who have regular contact with it.  This covers processing connected with membership, fundraising and all other activities in which we engage from time to time.<\/p><p>The introduction of a reference to protection of &ldquo;the vital interests of the data subject&rdquo; in amendment No. 35 is problematic because that term appears in Article 6.1(d) of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and it has been given a very narrow and restrictive interpretation.  If adopted in this context, it would impose a heavier burden on the person making a request or representation on behalf of a data subject without the capacity to make a request or representation on their own behalf.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 40 would appear to introduce an unnecessary consistency test whereas the current wording provides a legal basis for a response enabling an elected representative to respond to a request or representation.  Amendment No. 40 would impose a condition that any such response must be \"in such manner as is consistent with his or her role and functions as an elected representative\".  It is important to note that responsibility for compliance with this test would rest with the person disclosing the data to the elected representative, not with the elected representative.<\/p> <p> The proposal in amendment No. 41 to replace the specified safeguard in section 38(2) with a general reference to &ldquo;reasonable and proportionate measures&rdquo; would not meet the &ldquo;suitable and specific measures&rdquo; threshold in section 35.  The current text of section 38(2) incorporates the safeguard set out in section 35(1)(b) of the Bill.<\/p> <p> I draw Members' attention to Government amendment No. 148, which contains amendments to section 13A of the Electoral Act 1992 in a new section 173.  It inserts a new subsection (3C), which provides that the electoral register may be used by a specified person referred to in section 38 for the purpose of communicating with data subjects under that section, or by an elected representative referred to in section 39 for the purposes of that section.<\/p> <p> I do not wish to introduce any element of confusion because it is very important that we are clear here.  I am confident that the combined impact of sections 38, 39 and 173, which is the new section that we will come to later on, will preserve the important role of elected public representatives in performing their representative functions and day-to-day tasks in serving the electorate.  I have been in this House a long time by dint of my work as a public representative and through my constituency work, serving my electorate.  I have examined the situation closely.  The objective of Deputy Thomas Byrne is clear in his amendment.  I am in agreement with him on this but I do not want to do anything that might result in uncertainty.

This is in spite of the fact that what is proposed in terms of the processing of political opinion in the Bill will still be illegal under the GDPR.<\/p>  <p>  Section 38, for the most part, is fairly harmless.

We propose to delete section 38(2).  Communication of the type described in section 38 is clearly committed under the GDPR as a \"legitimate interest\".  I am not sure why we need to declare such communication to be a task in the public interest in such specific terms given that processing in the public interest in the GDPR gives us scope to bypass the consent of the data subject, for example.  I understand the basic necessity for political parties to communicate with the electorate, and this kind of communication is, obviously, for the most part in the public interest.

They are very important aspects.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak on amendment No. 25.  The new section inserted by the Government on Committee Stage designates direct marketing by politicians, as long as it is in writing, as being carried out as a task in the public interest.  It is highly questionable that a politician perpetuating his or her existence and inflicting it on anybody else could be legitimately defined as \"in the public interest\".  It is completely unnecessary.  Politicians and political candidates can already rely on the legitimate interest ground in the GDPR.  Artificially designating written communication, which could include text messages from politicians, as being \"in the public interest\" when they could rely on the legitimate interest ground could cause problems because it takes away some of the obligation we have to balance the rights of citizens and the rights of politicians.  This is why we have tabled amendment No. 25, which proposes to delete the odd public interest designation.  We believe it is unnecessary.  Politicians can already communicate and it is already lawful.<\/p><p>We must, however, take into account the fact that in the 2011 election, the then Data Protection Commissioner, Mr. Billy Hawkes, received many complaints about politicians' unsolicited text messages.

We are weakening citizens' position in that regard.<\/p> <p> Deputy Thomas Byrne's amendments would make the situation worse.  He is extending the definition of \"electoral activities\" and referring to communications with party memberships, but since the latter are allowed for under the GDPR on a range of grounds, the amendment is unnecessary.  The Deputy is proposing that fundraising and political surveys could be deemed to be in the public interest.  That would make it lawful for a political party to send me an email every day for the rest of my life looking for money.

Turning to our amendment No. 51, section 47 is important and troublesome.  Under it, the Government proposes to rely on recital 56 to justify allowing political parties anywhere to process the political opinions of anyone for the purposes of electoral activities.  There is no territorial limit.  If a German Cambridge Analytica wanted to process the political opinions of a few million Germans to sway the next German election, it would just have to send the data to Ireland.  With such a vague definition of &quot;electoral activities&quot;, there is no time limit on when political parties can process the data.  People who want to get their hands on data about political opinions just have to put themselves forward as candidates for election.  Lo and behold, they would then get around the general prohibition in the GDPR on that kind of data processing without explicit consent.  That is why we are opposing the section.  There is no non-creepy reason for allowing anyone to do this and profile people without their consent.  One can profile people all one wants if one gets their consent.<\/p><p>All of Ireland's main data protection experts are vehemently against this section.  Before Committee Stage, they wrote an open letter to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>calling for the removal of the section's blanket exemptions on the processing of personal data revealing political opinions.  These people pursued litigation previously and they know what they are talking about, so we would be silly to ignore their viewpoint.  What is being proposed in this section is permission to create databases, profiles or whatever one wishes to call them for people who have nothing to do with a political party.<\/p><p>I will respond to points made by Deputy O'Callaghan on Committee Stage.  Polls, focus groups, canvass tallies and so forth would still be allowed if this section were deleted.  If people plan on using such information in the course of one of those activities, all that is required is for consent to be gained to note someone's political view, name and address.  That is not a major ask, given that we are discussing the collection of personal data that can be used to match information to identify people.<\/p><p>Our amendment No. 68 is important.  This section removes the right of citizens to object to their data being processed in order to post them letters and flyers from politicians.  It tries to claim that mailings from politicians are not direct marketing.  Articles 17 and 21(2) of the GDPR make it clear that the citizen has an absolute right to object to the use of his or her personal data to send him or her direct mail, text messages, etc.  This section, however, allows politicians to send out unsolicited mail and stops people from objecting to that.  In a balancing test, the desirability of citizens being informed about what their politicians are doing against the rights of citizens to object if they feel that their privacy is being invaded should come down on the side of the citizen.  Citizens should have the right to object.  Politicians get that all of the time.  For example, people have told me that they do not want me to send them leaflets.  That is fine, but this section removes the right to object.  That is wrong.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 71 addresses section 58, which proposes to remove the right of citizens to object to the processing of their data for any purpose as long as it is carried out by political parties, candidates or the referendum commission.  While various exemptions under the GDPR permit processing in the public interest, recital 69 makes it clear that the right to object in those circumstances must remain.  Even if we accept that the processing of personal data by political parties for electoral purposes is in the public interest, which is arguable, we cannot strip people of their right to object to it while staying compliant with the GDPR.  This amendment must be carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600042#UU00700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":426,"content":"<p>The prospect that the Deputy holds out of her joining Fianna F&aacute;il is certainly fascinating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600042#UU00800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":427,"content":"<p>She should not worry.

Regarding section 47 and influences from outside the State or otherwise, the section is clear in that its provisions are confined to electoral activities within the State for elections within the State by a political party registered within the State.

In that regard, electoral activity must be clearly understood in a broad sense to be more than just activity within the confines of the three weeks, 28 days or whatever.  In support of this point, I will point out that we do not have fixed-term parliaments.  As such, all of the activities of elected representatives and candidates are undertaken with an eye on the next election.  Suffice it for me to draw on our earlier debate when Deputy O'Callaghan gave way to Deputy Byrne on the matter of the digital age of consent.  Regardless of when an election takes place, electoral activity continues.  I say this to be of assistance to Deputy Byrne and to assure him that I am keen to go as far as I can on the objective of his amendments within the strictures of the GDPR and without introducing new elements of uncertainty in the matter of political activities.  I take the Deputy's point about political activities and I like the phrase \"political activities\", but if we are to introduce new definitions or phrases without an appropriate level of definition, we will get into uncertainty and difficulty.  \"Electoral activities\" is known in law to be the work that we do on a continual basis.

We have resubmitted these amendments on Report Stage because they are quite important.  According to recital 50, processing for purposes incompatible with the one for which the data was originally collected may be allowed if the person consents and the processing is based on European Union or member state law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard important objectives of general public interest.  Section 40 of the Bill allows for the processing of sensitive categories of data, such as one's political opinion, sexual orientation, race and so on, and general personal data for reasons other than that for which they were collected in order to prevent a threat to national security, to prevent, investigate or prosecute crimes or for the purpose of getting legal advice and so on.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 42 and 45 propose that further processing of very sensitive data would be permitted for all those crime stopping and public security reasons except the prevention of crime.  The reasoning for that is that the GDPR does not apply to competent authorities such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when processing data for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties.  It applies to everybody except competent authorities such as the Garda.<\/p><p>Section 38 proposes to give public bodies or companies the right to collect or compile databases in which people's identities are linked to things such as their political opinions, trade union membership, religion and so on for the purposes of preventing crime.  It is very hard to imagine a situation where information held by a private company or public body about a person's religious affiliation, sexual orientation, political opinion, trade union membership or so on would ever be so absolutely essential for preventing crime as to outweigh the dangers of the impact on people's freedom of expression and association.  It would not be worth it because the prevention of crime is a very nebulous concept.  The amendment would allow the passing on of special category data by private companies to the Garda for the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the prevention of threats to national security but the prevention of crime would be open to too many interpretations.  It is a catch-all and a step too far.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 44 proposes that further processing of personal data would be lawful for all the various crime and security reasons but rather than it being lawful for the purposes of preventing crime, the tighter wording of &quot;avoiding prejudicing the prevention of crime&quot;, taken from the equivalent UK legislation, would be used.  Amendment No. 43 provides that further processing would be allowed only if it is necessary and proportionate for various crime and terror fighting purposes, having regard to the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject.  That introduces a balancing requirement whereby such further processing would only be lawful if the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject did not outweigh the reasons to reprocess his or her personal data.<\/p><p>Taken as a group, these amendments do not prevent the reuse of personal data by private or public organisations in general for crime prevention but, rather, only special category data.  Data such as names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses and IP addresses could still be used for crime prevention reasons as the amendments only address data such as one's sexual orientation, trade union membership, political views and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600043#VV00700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486100,"counter":442,"content":"<p>These amendments attempt to reshuffle section 40 and involve the insertion of a new section 41.  We are trying to deal with personal data and special categories of personal data separately.  The two categories are currently lumped together in the Bill.  Article 23 of the GDPR is the relevant provision in this regard.  It does not make an explicit distinction between the processing of personal and specific categories of data but several sections of the GDPR state that special categories of data should be treated with special care.  We have, therefore, attempted to separate personal data from special categories of personal data through amendments Nos. 42 to 45.  I accept that Article 23 of the GDPR refers to the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, for example, which is provided for by section 40(b) of the Bill.  However, the problem these amendments are trying to address relates to the scope the word \"preventing\" introduces in regard to criminal offences, in particular in the context of special categories of personal data such as religious beliefs, political opinion, ethnicity and sexual orientation.  The GDPR and section 40 of the Bill do not apply to the Garda and the processing of data referred to in this section does not, therefore, apply to it.  Section 40 would essentially permit profiling based on race, political ideology or religious beliefs should the processing of special categories of data be included.  As I stated on Committee Stage, a body other than the Garda would, therefore, be able to profile a person based on his or her ethnicity, religion or political opinions in the name of preventing a criminal offence in the broadest sense.  The phrasing in our amendment, \"avoiding prejudicing the prevention, investigation or prosecution of\" a criminal offence is based on wording used in the British Data Protection Bill and would prevent the kind of profiling to which I have referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600043#VV00800","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486100,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I regret that I have been unable to advance matters with Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace since our debate on this issue on Committee Stage when I took the opportunity to explain and put into context the importance of the section.

Under sections 2 and 3 of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, it is an offence to withhold any information on offences referred to in that Act.

The processing of special categories of data is a serious issue under the GDPR.  That is what we are trying to highlight in this section.

The Minister referred to the requirements and the exceptions in that they are not contained in the Bill.  The GDPR as European law will be Irish law.  They are well enumerated in the GDPR.  It outlines biometric data as personal data resulting from specific technical processes relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person which allows or confirms the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data.  The GDPR consent requirements define biometric data as special categories of personal data and prohibit its processing, thereby protecting people from having their data shared with third parties without their consent.  The exception to that consent is that processing is prohibited unless necessary for carrying out obligations of the controller or the data subject in the field of employment, social security and social protection.<\/p>  <p>  This is very relevant to the issue of the development of the public services card and the questions about the use of biometric data in that regard.  The Government has found itself in difficulty, especially in respect of the Road Safety Authority recently and the requirements that were provided there, as well as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We have not had adequate public debate on the use of biometric data or the possibility of the public services card being used as a sort of proxy identity card with biometric data.

That is not really much use.  It is no guarantee that they will get a human intervention if they want it.  There is no obligation, even on a controller, for example, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection processing welfare claims, to respond or deal with representations it gets.  As the Bill is currently constituted, it can just ignore them.<\/p><p>That is way too serious.  We know for example that in the United States where automated benefit systems operate, it has resulted in millions of benefit applicants being denied over a period of years.  Those people at least had the right to an appeal and a human intervention.  Another example was the Garda roll-out of the automatic number plate recognition system.  When introduced, it was misreading number plates and showing everybody as having no car insurance.  Fortunately, at the time it was so broad, the system was stopped and corrected.  However, one can easily imagine another case where not everybody was caught up in the loop and somebody was tied up in having to make an appeal and require human intervention.  It is not guaranteed now.  It is quite an important amendment.  It is not onerous, it will actually defend citizens&rsquo; rights and make us much more compliant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600048#AAA00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1526488800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The essential features of the amendment are already contained in section 56.

The section also proposes to give the Minister wide discretion to limit the rights and freedoms of persons if he or she thinks it is necessary to do so for the protection of a data subject or where he or she thinks the exercise of a right is likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of a data subject.  That seems to be fair enough, but there is no provision in the section to oblige the Minister to balance the rights and freedoms of data subjects and others in circumstances where he or she is proposing to restrict a right, for example, access to information.  It cannot be the case that the Minister is the final arbiter in deciding whose rights trump whose without having to perform a balancing action.  That is where we are coming from in amendment No. 74.  It would oblige the Minister to have regard to the balance of rights and would not be a great imposition.  It is important that the Minister should have to do this.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 74 ties in with amendment No. 75.  Under section 59, the Minister will have the power to limit data subjects' rights in the case of data obtained and kept in the course of the carrying out of social work by a public body, a voluntary organisation or another body.  On the face of it, this also seems to be vaguely okay, but if we scratch a little deeper, it becomes obvious that this restriction of rights probably will be used, for example, to refuse information to adopted children on their natural parents.  We have a history of this happening in this country.  Given that one of the rights listed between Articles 12 and 22, inclusive, is a right to access information a data controller holds on a person, it seems obvious that this provision could be used to limit the right to access information of adopted persons in a broad and non-transparent way.  For example, there could be a refusal to grant a person information on the grounds that it might damage his or her mental health.  That is critically important.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 77 seeks to delete ensuring the effective operation of the immigration system as one of the general public interest grounds on which the rights of persons can be suspended.  The reason we have tabled this amendment is to put it on the Minister's radar that we will be keeping an eye out for regulations made under the section that will seek to restrict the right of persons to access information or to have corrected erroneous information held on them by bodies such as the INIS.<\/p><p>There is an enormous controversy in the United Kingdom about a similar provision in its Data Protection Bill and a legal case against it is being prepared.  In the United Kingdom it is proposed to restrict the rights of persons under Articles 14 to 16, inclusive, among others.  Those taking the case point out that the provision is discriminatory and will mean that those involve in immigration disputes will find it impossible to obtain the data immigration authorities have used against them, thus making it impossible to build a case or lodge an appeal against a decision made against them.  The suspension of these rights will also mean that it will be impossible for immigrants to correct or challenge erroneous data held on file about them.  It will also prevent them from finding out how their data were obtained and shared, thus allowing unlawful data to be shared, go unchallenged and remain a secret.<\/p><p>We do not yet know which of the rights under Articles 12 to 22, inclusive, the Minister will seek to restrict under this section in the case of immigrants.  It will be laid out in regulations down the line.  As a Parliament, we will be asked to approve those regulations, which is fair enough.  We are merely flagging this serious issue.  We want to mark it here and now, particularly as it is the subject of litigation across the water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600051#DDD00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1526490000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy of the amendments that were passed last night which have some significance in the context of the safeguards about which she has spoken.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 74 proposes to insert some text at the beginning of subsection (5).  It does not appear to be necessary because of subsection (12) as inserted by amendment No. 80, to which we agreed last night.  It already provides that any regulation made under section 59 to which the Deputy referred must respect the essence of the right to data protection and restrict the exercise of data subject rights only in so far as it is both necessary and proportionate.  <\/p> <p> Amendment No. 75 seeks to delete subsection (5) in its entirety.  I have a problem with this because the particular provision is carried over from section 5(8) of the 1988 Act.  It allows limited restrictions on data subject rights for social work purposes where, for example, a risk to the health or welfare of children is being assessed by a social worker.  Regulations under the section will allow the necessary inquiries to be made by the social worker and access to the data collected in the case could be restricted by means of regulations but only to the extent that and for as long as the release of such information would be likely to cause serious harm to the physical health or mental health of the data subject.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 77 seeks to delete section 59(7)(h).  I have a difficulty with this, too.  As a result of the amendments made last night, the data protection commission must be consulted on all regulations to be made under the section.  Any significant concern not taken on board by the relevant Minister must be communicated directly to the justice committee and any other relevant committee of the Houses.  In addition, the draft regulations, because of the positive resolution or positive affirmation that is necessary, must be submitted to both Houses for positive resolutions.  The safeguards will provide an opportunity in both Houses to discuss the merits of any such proposal at that time and in such a format as might be proposed within the regulations.

discussion on Committee Stage I agreed to examine the content of what are now amendments Nos. 87, 88, 90 and 91, tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.  Arising from that examination, I have tabled Government amendments Nos. 86 and 89 by way of response to concerns raised on Committee Stage.  I thank the Deputies for raising these issues.<\/p><p>I regret that I am unable to accept amendment No. 92 tabled by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, even though I have to admit I have some sympathy for its objective.  It deals with the risk a data protection officer may encounter non-co-operation, duress, harassment or victimisation in the workplace and may as a result be unable to perform his or her duties.  I had the opportunity to consider this issue during earlier discussions in the Seanad and I am still of the view that a more effective remedy is available to data protection officers under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  The House will be aware that a disclosure of relevant information is protected under that Act.  If, in the reasonable belief of a worker, it tends to show a relevant wrongdoing and it came to his or her attention in connection with his or her employment, &quot;relevant wrongdoing&quot;, as defined in section 5(3) of the Act, includes that a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with a legal obligation.  This includes the data controller's obligation towards the data protection officer.  <\/p><p>Section 7 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 provides for protected disclosures to an external person prescribed in an order made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in Statutory Instrument 339\/2014, in which the Data Protection Commissioner has been prescribed as a recipient of disclosures in respect of all matters concerning compliance with data protection law.<\/p><p>In SI 339 of 2014, the Data Protection Commissioner has been prescribed as a recipient of disclosures in respect of all matters concerning compliance with data protection law.  This provides an effective remedy where a data protection officer, DPO, is experiencing difficulty in performing his or her functions.  A further advantage, and an important aspect, is that any DPO making such a protected disclosure will enjoy the extensive protections against dismissal, victimisation and detriment provided under Part 3 of the 2014 Act.<\/p> <p> Another shortcoming in Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment No. 92 is that it would, if accepted, apply only to DPOs appointed by law enforcement authorities operating under Part 5 and would not protect the larger number of DPOs operating under the GDPR.  All DPOs, whether operating under the GDPR or Part 5 of this Bill, will have protection under section 7 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 as elaborated by SI 339 of 2014.  I have considered this carefully since we last debated it and, while I appreciate the motivation for this proposal and have some sympathy with the import of the amendment, I cannot accept it because we have a more effective remedy under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  I do not want a situation to arise where in terms of practice there is not only uncertainty but also confusion between two Acts, one of which is specifically designed to meet the protected disclosure, and not have new amendments here in this legislation that have particular relevance to the 2014 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600052#EEE02600","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526491200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>We appreciate the Government's coming back with amendment No. 86 which is a version of a variety of amendments we tabled on Committee Stage and which we resubmitted in case the Government did not do so.  We are happy to support it and will withdraw our amendments Nos. 87 and 90.<\/p>  <p>  These amendments deal with DPOs who work for competent authorities as this section is in Part 5, the criminal justice part.  We are curious as to why the Government has rejected our suggestions in amendments Nos. 88 to 91, inclusive.  These are, briefly, that a DPO shall not be penalised for the performance of his or her tasks, that one of the DPO's functions is to act as a point of contact for people in regard to what is happening to their information and their rights under this Part, and that a data subject may contact a DPO to ask questions about what is happening to their data and what kind of rights they have under this Part.  While we will not push amendment No. 89, we think amendments Nos. 88 and 91 are important.<\/p>  <p>  DPOs, particularly in competent authorities such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has a less than stellar reputation for dealing with people who point out wrongdoing, should have the same protections as their colleagues in other public bodies.  Article 38 of the GDPR which applies to everyone except competent authorities like the Garda states that a DPO \"shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his tasks\".  Why would we not protect them similarly under Part 5, especially since the Government has accepted the general principle of giving DPOs in Part 5 most of the Article 38 protections?  Equally what reason could there be for a DPO not to have as part of his or her job answering questions from people suspected of crime or victims of crime about what is happening to their data and what kind of rights they have under this Part?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600053#FFF00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1526491200,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Wallace's and Deputy Clare Daly's amendments because while they deal with different aspects of the Bill, their intention is the same.

That might be in the interests of individuals or senior management within any organisation and could restrict the DPO's ability to do his or her job properly.<\/p>  <p>  I take on board what the Minister has said.  It was somewhat more detailed than his contribution on this amendment on Committee Stage.  While I recognise that the data protection commission is a prescribed organisation under the legislation I am concerned that the procedure would be protracted and slow.  My amendment to subsection (2) of the section that it is intended to insert allows the commission to take corrective action.  There should be a direct line between DPOs and the data protection commission beyond the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  If somebody was concerned and contacted them directly outside the scope of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, there would be scope for advice and support and so on.  A complaint made under a section of this Act would allow the commission to take corrective action quickly and directly against the people in those organisations which were potentially hindering, undermining or harassing the person who was trying to do his or her job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600053#FFF00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1526491200,"counter":536,"content":"<p>This group of amendments seeks to provide protection for the DPO.

If a DPO is dismissed for performing his or her functions, he or she is entitled to seek the protection of the court for wrongful or unfair dismissal or for constructive dismissal if his or her senior manager is preventing him or her from carrying out his or her functions as required.<\/p>  <p>  I support amendment No. 86 but it does give an extraordinary level of protection to a DPO stating that he or she shall \"not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of such functions\".  The objective is to try to ensure that a DPO is not inappropriately interfered with.  We have also to recognise the possibility that DPOs who are incompetent, who do not perform their functions in an appropriate manner or who do not carrying them out in accordance with what their job requires will be appointed.

It seeks to delete an amendment we had accepted on Committee Stage, which was a pretty innocuous amendment in that it only obliged a controller to give a person such further information as he or she might need to exercise his or rights under Part 5.  It adds one additional point to the list in section 89(2) in terms of information which data subjects have a right to get from data controllers.  Most of the items of information included in subsection (2), such as information on a controller's contact details, the right to lodge a complaint and the purpose for which the data is being processed and so on, are replicated in the GDPR and the directive but the point, \"such further information as is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise his or her rights\", is not included in this Bill.  The amendment tabled and accepted on Committee Stage sought to ensure that it is included and the Government is now taking it out.  Given we are speaking about Part 5 and people caught up in the criminal justice system, people who more often than not are poor or are vulnerable and do not know much about their rights let alone how to exercise them, I do not believe it would be a burden on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to give these people a leaflet about their rights and information about to whom they can make a complaint if they believe their rights have been infringed.  We are at a loss as to why it should be taken out of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  On amendment No. 94, Article 13(2)(f) of the GDPR gives people a right to be given information about the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, at least in those cases, a right to meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.  This right is not replicated in the directive or in this Bill.  We believe it should be included and that it could be potentially valuable.  The criminal justice directive transposed in Part 5 prohibits automated processing, including profiling that results in discrimination, but to enforce the right not to be profiled, a person would have to be told about it when he or she exercises the right of access to information he or she is being given under section 90, but this section, as drafted, does not oblige the controllers to inform people that they have been profiled or subjected to automated processing.  Again, because this is Part 5, what we are talking about is potential profiling of innocent citizens in a discriminatory way by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so on.  We believe it is very important that people get the information they need.  If somebody asks for information about what the Garda has been doing with his or her data, he or she should be given all of the information so that he or she can judge whether the profiling is discriminatory.  Amendment No. 94 would achieve this.

There is a huge problem when it comes to people's privacy rights under data protection legislation in that individuals do not have the expertise, knowledge, time or money to enforce their legal rights.  We are aware that the Irish legal system is incredibly expensive and it is difficult for lawyers to navigate, never mind people who are unfamiliar with it.  Many people will never have the right to enforce their rights through the courts because the costs are beyond them.<\/p>  <p>  Article 80 of the GDPR has a mandatory provision that member states must allow individuals to nominate a not-for-profit body to act on their behalf to make complaints to a data protection authority, appeal against the decisions, or take action against a controller such as an Internet service provider where it has abused personal data.<\/p>  <p>  Two optional parts of the Article 80, that member states may allow individuals to nominate not-for-profit groups to act on their behalf to seek damages and they may allow not-for-profit groups to bring actions on their own initiative without the need for an individual to nominate them.  When Dr. T. J. McIntyre appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill he said, \"It is very important that Ireland would take up the two aspects of flexibility in the GDPR\", which we have not.  As it stands, this Bill does not allow mandated non-profit bodies to seek damages and it does not allow non-profit bodies to take actions independently, be it by bringing a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner or by going to court on behalf of people's data rights.  Clearly the GDPR contains the provision on non-profit bodies taking independent actions because the people who negotiate it know that in many cases in this area of law data subjects would not even know enough about their rights to know if they had been breached.<\/p>  <p>  It is notable that the massive safe harbour data sharing agreement was struck down as being unlawful on the basis of one person who knew his rights and asserted those rights as a data privacy campaigner.  It was not the case that a bunch of people started asserting their rights.  This is why the safe harbour arrangement went down.  Most people did not know that what was happening to them was illegal.  It took one dogged campaigner who knew enough and who was consistent enough after being fobbed off by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner who dismissed his complaint as frivolous to take a challenge.  The whole edifice of dodgy sharing of data with the United States of America fell down off the back of that complaint.  This is why we need to take up the optional provision around non-profit bodies taking cases independently.<\/p>  <p>  In its most recent opinion on the dangers posed by marked targeting, micro-targeting and manipulation during political campaigns, the European Data Protection Supervisor strongly recommended, on the basis of the dangers posed to democracy by such manipulation, that member states take up the optional provisions to allow non-profit bodies to take cases independently.  This is what we are at.  We need that provision and the provision for damages to have effective privacy rights and access to justice.<\/p>  <p>  In brief, amendments Nos. 100, 114 and 116 are about giving effect to the two optional provisions under the GDPR in an everyday context.  That is all circumstances except in criminal justice.  Amendment No. 100 provides for the right for complaints to be lodged with the data protection commission and for cases to be taken independently by non-profit bodies.  Amendment No. 114 allows for non-profit bodies to go to court independently.  Amendment No. 115 allows for non-profit bodies taking cases, if they are mandated to do so by a data subject, to seek damages.  Amendment No. 116 says that if a non-profit body takes a case independently of a person's mandate, then it is not allowed to seek damages.  This is a provision of the GDPR and it is why we have it included it here.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's amendment No. 122 seeks to remove the amendment that we succeeded with on Committee Stage, and I am absolutely sure of this, that allows non-profit bodies taking action on behalf of data subjects under Part 5 to seek damages on the data subject's behalf.  We will resist the rowing back on this amendment from Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Our amendment No. 117 seeks to insert a Part 5 provision whereby non-profit bodies can independently lodge claims where they feel that data rights have been breached.  Amendment No. 123 is consequential on that since it provides that they cannot seek damages, as in the case of amendment No. 116 where non-profit bodies taking a case independently are not allowed to seek damages under the GDPR.  That is the way we see it.  We strenuously object to amendment No. 122 and we very strongly recommend the other amendments in the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600055#HHH02900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1526492400,"counter":581,"content":"<p>The purpose of amendments Nos. 100, 114 and 117, as tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace, is to allow not-for-profit bodies, organisations and associations to exercise data subject rights on behalf of individuals before the Data Protection Commissioner and the courts but without the permission or agreement of those individuals.  That would amount to an extraordinary change in our law.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that Article 80(2) of the GDPR recognises that a member state may permit a not-for-profit body, association or organisation to take action on behalf of a data subject without the data subject&rsquo;s mandate in its national law.  That is not part of our national law or legal system, and compliance with the GDPR does not require such a provision.  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 100, 114 and 117 for that reason, or the related amendments Nos. 116 and 123.<\/p><p> Section 116(8) provides that a court hearing a data protection action taken by a non-profit organisation or association on behalf of a data subject may not award compensation for any damage suffered.  This restriction in the taking of compensation claims by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation seeks to discourage speculative compensation claims, especially where the data subject may be relieved of any risk that the costs of the action may be awarded against him or her.  There are sound public policy reasons for discouraging the growth of an excessive compensation culture in data protection claims.  As the Deputies will be aware, there is already concern about the level of compensation claims in Ireland, which is contributing to increasing insurance premium costs and affecting business across the board, especially SMEs.  Amendment No. 115 tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace seeks to reverse this position by allowing not-for-profit bodies, associations and organisations that may act on behalf of data subjects to seek and claim compensation and the courts to award compensation.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p> <p> Government amendment No. 122 seeks to replace section 127(7).  The subsection was amended by the select committee to allow not-for-profit bodies, organisations and associations to seek compensation on behalf of data subjects for infringements of the law enforcement directives and allow the courts to award compensation.  For the reasons I have outlined, I am seeking in the amendment to reinstate the earlier text of the subsection.  The amended subsection is a broad departure and one that requires careful consideration that we have not given to it.  I am not prepared to accept the broadly based nature of what is, in effect, a wide-ranging public policy change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600055#HHH03000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526493000,"counter":583,"content":"<p>We view this as an important part of the Bill.

That right is only being given to poor people, as it were, or those who cannot access the law and must go to a not-for-profit organisation in order to get justice.  If a person has enough money, he or she can go to a lawyer to seek an application.  It is important that not-for-profit organisations be able to seek damages.

If one does not have the money to do so, that remedy is beyond one's reach.<\/p>  <p>  Although it would not address all of the issues raised in the amendments, the Multi-Party Actions Bill 2017 would, to some extent, offer an avenue for persons who had been wronged in any of a variety of ways, including data breaches, to work together in taking a case.

This is provided for in section 116.  However, amendment No. 100 tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace is not only novel but would also completely alter the way litigation was conducted.  Currently, if someone is the victim of a data breach, he or she goes through the process with the commission.  If that person wishes to bring a case to court, it is wrong to say he or she cannot do so.  Most solicitors will take actions on a no foal, no fee basis.  These actions will get to court.  However, what makes amendment No. 100 so novel, which is an understatement, is that it would enable a not-for-profit body to take an application to court on behalf of a person whose data had been breached, even if that person had not mandated the action.  It would be an extraordinary change to the way litigation is conducted.  Someone who did not want to go to court or did not say he or she wanted to do so would have a case taken for him or her, independently of his or her mandate, to the courts.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking as a lawyer, this would probably be one of the most popular legislative measures ever introduced.  There might be statues built to Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace outside Blackhall Place in the years to come if the amendment was to get through.  However, it would be an inappropriate amendment.  For example, industrious and enterprising lawyers could decide to set up a not-for-profit organisation.  It would be established legitimately and have legitimate interests and take actions on behalf of persons whose data had been breached.  They would not mandate the actions or ask the not-for-profit body to go to court.  The body would go to court; the case would be lengthy and complex and, while there might not be an award of damages, an injunction or declaration could be granted.  The successful party would then be entitled to apply for and receive costs.  Were I an industrious and entrepreneurial lawyer, I would set up a not-for-profit body that would take such cases, at the end of which I would receive a large amount in costs.  That is not the reason Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace tabled the amendment and Article 80(2) of the regulation expressly provides for this, but it would be inappropriate for our system.  Many people have gone before the courts as a result of data breaches.  They received a good service and their cases were taken on a no foal, no fee basis.  If someone wants a judicial remedy, he or she needs to be interested in going before the court.  It would be inappropriate for someone's cause of action to be brought before the court by a body that did not have his or her mandate.<\/p>  <p>  On the other amendments in the group, amendment No. 114 reads, \"independently of the data subject's mandate\".  For the reasons I have outlined, that would not be appropriate.  Amendments Nos. 115 to 117, inclusive, are in the same vogue, but I agree that it would be wrong to set aside the decision made by the committee when we agreed to insert in the section an entitlement to award compensation.  If someone takes a case to court, the way we reflect damages in the legal system is by an award of general damages.  It is a pyrrhic victory if someone who finds out that his or her data have been breached goes to court and succeeds only to receive no award of damages.  Unless I hear something persuasive from the Minister, I will not support amendment No. 122.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600056#JJJ00500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1526493000,"counter":587,"content":"<p>If the Minister wishes to respond, he has two minutes in which to do so.

As has been stated, the Bill places no obligation on the data protection commission to investigate the complaints it receives.  All of our previous relevant data protection legislation provided that the data protection commission \"shall\" investigate the complaints it receives but there is no such explicit obligation in this Bill.  Rather, the data protection commission can examine the complaint and take such action as it sees fit, which could include throwing the complaint in the bin.  There is nothing to prevent it doing so.<\/p>  <p>  When Max Schrems went to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner many years ago, his compliant was deemed frivolous and vexatious.  That complaint was later upheld by the European Court of Justice and led to the striking down of the safe harbour principles for data sharing between the EU and the US.  It turned out to be a very big deal but it was dismissed by the Data Protection Commissioner.  We have tabled these amendments out of concern at what would happen if we allow the data protection commission to do no more than examine, given the outcome of the Schrems case which it was required to investigate.<\/p>  <p>  It is not about the big marquee cases but, rather, trying to assist ordinary people to protect their rights.  As was stated in regard to earlier groupings, the vast majority of citizens do not have access to courts in this country.  We must have a data protection commission that investigates complaints to keep those complaints out of the courts and prevent the courts being bogged down, as Deputy O'Callaghan stated.  We need a data protection commission that helps people to navigate this complicated area and get justice if their rights have been breached.  Many Members tabled amendments with a similar aim on Committee Stage.  Sinn F&eacute;in resubmitted its amendment but Fianna F&aacute;il did not.  There was cross-committee agreement, however, that the data protection commission should be obliged to investigate and that that was an important principle.  Members differed on how that should be done.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to outline why we have tabled this amendment in this format.  Our issue with swapping the word \"examine\" for \"investigate\" relates to how the Bill is structured.  Complaint handling under section 108, which provides for an individual to submit a complaint, is quite different from complaint handling under the sections providing for situations in which the data protection commission undertakes an inquiry.  The Bill states that the data protection commission will initiate an inquiry of its own volition or where it is the lead supervisory authority in a complaint sent to it by another supervisory authority in the EU.  \"Inquiry\" has a particular meaning in the Bill.  Rather than the data protection commission having two similar but not identical procedures, one for complaints from the little people and one for issues it decides to look at of its own volition, the same inquiry procedure should apply across the board.<\/p>  <p>  We maintain the position that the data protection commission has a wide discretion in how it conducts an inquiry, what kind of corrective action it takes on foot of a complaint, what kinds of enforcement order it might issue and so on.  We do not propose to fetter its discretion.  In essence, these large number of amendments are trying to create a single procedure for complaint handling by the data protection commission.   It is a complicated Bill.  We think these amendments would simplify it such that people looking at it and trying to figure out what will happen when they complain would not get a headache from so doing.<\/p><p>They would be able to get rid of the artificial distinction between complaints from ordinary people and complaints referred by another DPC.  It would avert the absolutely cast-iron guaranteed inevitability of people who complain to the DPC feeling their complaint has not been investigated properly - either rightly or wrongly.<\/p> <p> It is unfortunate that we did not get to debate the idea of a single, unified procedure for complaint handling properly on Committee Stage instead of getting bogged down in a debate about the phrase \"frivolous and vexatious\".  We are conscious on Report Stage of such an important Bill that if we push these amendments we could possibly run the risk that it could lead to minor drafting issues that could have unintended consequences in other parts of the Bill, which is not our intention.  We are conscious of that but we want to strongly register those points on the record and ask the Government at the very least to ask the commission to produce guidance for the general public that makes it clear that it can and will investigate the complaints of the little people.  I ask that any such guidance would clarify the various enforcement and corrective powers that the Bill makes clear the DPC has when it comes to what it investigates itself or for other DPCs and that they are also available to us when it comes to our complaints.  In order for people to assert their rights they must first understand what they are.  Perhaps I will wait and see what the Minister says in his reply but we very much make that appeal in good faith and in the interests of delivering a good and accurate Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600057#KKK00700","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526494200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Chapters 2 and 3 of Part 6 contain key sections dealing with enforcement of the GDPR and the directive, respectively.  Sections 108 and 121 are key sections dealing with the handling of complaints by the commission.  As I said earlier and on Committee Stage I fear there may be some misunderstandings about how they will operate.  So, at the outset, I will briefly run through the complaints system as set out in the Bill.<\/p><p>Section 108(1) requires the DPC to examine every complaint it receives and to take such action as it considers appropriate, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the complaint.  Where, as referred to in subsection (2) of that section, an amicable resolution is not reached in those cases in which the commission considers that there is a reasonable likelihood of the parties reaching such a resolution within a reasonable period, the commission must proceed to take an action specified in subsection (5) in a domestic case, or under section 112 in a cross-border case.<\/p><p>Section 108(4) makes it clear that the commission is under an obligation and that it &quot;shall proceed&quot; to take action.  It does not have discretion to simply ignore or disregard a complaint.  This means that the reference to &quot;such action&quot; in subsection (1) is a reference to action that the commission must take, not to whether or not to take action.<\/p><p>As regards notification of the data subject, subsection (6) requires the commission, as soon as practicable after taking an action referred to in subsection (5), to give the data subject a notice in writing setting out the action it has taken in response to his or her complaint.  As regards paragraph (e) of subsection (5), where the commission conducts an inquiry under that provision in respect of the complaint, it may use any of its extensive powers under Chapter 4.<\/p><p>Under section 111, where an inquiry has been carried out in respect of a complaint and the commission is the competent authority, at that stage the commission must decide whether an infringement has occurred or is occurring.  Where it concludes that an infringement has occurred or is occurring, section 111(2) obliges the commission to make a decision on whether a corrective power should be exercised and, if so, the power that is to be exercised.<\/p><p>The corrective powers are set out in Article 58(2) of the GDPR, and they include the possible imposition of hefty administrative fines.  Following the making of a decision under section 111, section 115(1)(a) requires the commission to notify the controller or processor concerned in writing of the decision; the reasons for it, and the corrective power it has decided to exercise.<\/p><p>Section 115(1)(b) requires it to provide the same information to the data subject who lodged the complaint.  A broadly similar procedure in section 121 applies to the handling of complaints under the directive.  That is a summary of the complaints procedure.<\/p><p>I will not respond to each amendment in this large grouping, but I will focus on the key amendments.  As regards Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's<b><\/b>amendment No. 101,<b><\/b>which would replace section 108(1), I have a serious problem with the introduction of a discretion on the part of the commission not to investigate a complaint that may be &quot;frivolous or vexatious.&quot;  First, it would not be GDPR-compliant.  Article 57.4 allows a data protection authority to refuse to act on a complaint only where requests &quot;are manifestly unfounded or excessive.&quot;  Any wider refusal to act on a complaint will in my view be in breach of the GDPR.<\/p><p>Second, as I said on a previous occasion, while the term &quot;frivolous or vexatious&quot; has a specific meaning here when used by Irish courts, that is, that the claim is unsustainable in law and is bound to fail or has no basis, I would not think it is widely understood across Europe.  It is a term that is understood by us here in our law under our common law system and system of litigation.  It may perhaps be understood in the UK but its future in Europe is under question.  However, that is a debate for another day.  This is a term that is not widely used nor indeed is it widely understood.  On the contrary, to a data subject or a data protection authority in another member state, use of the word &quot;frivolous&quot; suggests that the matter is not regarded as sufficiently serious for investigation, while &quot;vexatious&quot; has a completely different meaning, namely, that the complaint is seen as a deliberate intention to cause annoyance.  The scope for such misunderstandings will be much greater under the one-stop-shop mechanism because the data protection commission will be acting as the lead supervisory authority in many cross-border cases.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the term &quot;frivolous and vexatious&quot; is used in section 10(1)(b) of the 1988 Act and it has created confusion and misunderstandings in recent years, especially in cross-border cases.  Deputy Daly mentioned the Schrems case.  In that case Judge Hogan commented that the wording of that provision &quot;is somewhat unfortunate&quot;.  He went further than that and said it might indeed be &quot;unhelpful&quot;.  Its use was widely misinterpreted and misunderstood in the aftermath of that case in which Mr. Schrems successfully contested the adequacy of the safe harbour mechanism.  The risk of misinterpretation and misunderstanding will be very much greater because of the expected increase in the number of one-stop-shop cases handled by the DPC, which have originated in other member states.  I will not accept the alternative models put forward in the amendments to the complaints-handling mechanisms in Chapters 2 and 3 of Part 6.<\/p><p>As regards amendments Nos. 102 to 105, inclusive, I cannot accept the proposals therein to delete the options set out in section 108(5).  The same applies to amendments Nos. 118 to 120, inclusive, which would involve similar deletions in section 121.<\/p><p>Consequently, amendments Nos. 106 and 121, which propose to insert new sections in Chapters 2 and 3 are not acceptable.  Amendments Nos. 107 to 113, inclusive, and 125 to 128, inclusive, are consequential or related and because I cannot accept the earlier ones I will not accept those.  In her concluding remarks Deputy Daly suggested that I might ask the commission for guidance and I will do that.  I am happy to take the matter further in that regard.<\/p><p>My amendment No. 124 merely amends an incorrect cross-reference in subsection (1) of section 132.  Thank you for your forbearance, Acting Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600058#LLL00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1526494200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Perhaps it is the lateness of the hour but did the Minister say he is going to look to the commission for guidance for himself?

As I indicated in the Seanad, it would also cut across section 86 of the Bill, which already imposes an obligation on a controller to inform a data subject where there is a high risk to the data subject's rights and freedoms arising from a data breach.  In such a case, the controller must notify the data subjects in clear language of the nature of the breach and its likely consequences, and must describe the measures being taken, or proposed to be taken, to mitigate any possible adverse effects.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment before the House refers to a data breach \"which affects\" a data subject.  The ultimate meaning of those words is really unclear.  Under the GDPR and the directive, the thresholds for informing the data protection commission of a data breach, and for informing the data subjects whose data protection rights have been breached, are defined in terms of the risk for the data subject arising from the breach.  Under the GDPR and section 86 of this Bill, if a data breach involves a high level of risk for a data subject he or she must be given all relevant information and must have an opportunity to request further information as the need may arise.

I join the Minister in acknowledging the work done by Mr. Carroll and Ms Walsh in the Department.  It was a significant task to put together this legislation, which was for the part purpose of bringing into effect the GDPR - the parts of it that we wanted to put into the legislation - and also for the purpose of transposing the other accompanying directives.<\/p>  <p>  The process relating to the Bill has been fairly tortuous in terms of the work we have had to do on Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage.  That simply reflects the fact that it is going to have a very significant impact and consequences for people in Ireland.  The whole premise of the Bill is well-intentioned.  It is there to ensure that there is protection for the personal data of individuals.  However, it is not the case that the legislation will place burdens only on large corporations and how they deal with the smaller person.  In fact, it is also going to place significant obligations on the smaller person and business.  I have no doubt there will be difficulties with the legislation after it comes into force and after the GDPR becomes effective on Friday of next week.  Hopefully, it will not as torturous as the process relating to the legislation has been.<\/p>  <p>  The progress of the Bill also reflects the fact that we can do nothing in this House once regulations are agreed.  Once the regulation was signed up to on 27 April 2016, there was very little we could do.  This regulation is coming into effect on Friday week and nothing that this House or, indeed, the Seanad do will affect the provisions of the GDPR.  I hope it is a success.  I commend all the individuals who contributed here today and on Committee Stage.  Let us hope that the legislation will be effective in terms of achieving the primary purpose, which is the protection of individuals&rsquo; personal data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600061#OOO03900","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1526496000,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Before I speak to the Bill, I wish to raise a point of clarification.

The moral disgrace of homelessness and the unprecedented highs of the social housing waiting lists have obscured another major challenge which the Government has ignored.  Ordinary workers can no longer afford to buy their own homes.  Homeownership in our view is an important part of Irish life.  A safe and secure home is a building block for a strong community.  Having a place to call one's own is the bedrock of stable family life.  Working hard and owning the roof over one's head has been an aspiration that many have realised over the past few decades.<\/p>  <p>  However, for an entire generation, the dream of homeownership is slipping away.  While income levels have risen slowly, property prices have exploded by 90% since 2012.  As the property price escalator speeds up, those left in the rental market fall further behind.  Rent prices have surged over 25% higher than the 2008 peak with renters in Dublin paying over half their income for somewhere to live.  The current 60% homeownership rate is the lowest since 1971.  The age at which homeownership became the majority tenure category was 35 years of age in 2016.  Prior to that age, more households were renting rather than owning their own home.  When one compares this to previous censuses dating back to 1991, the ages which mark the changeover between renting and homeownership was 32 years in 2011, 28 in 2006, 27 in 2002 and 26 years in 1991.  It is clear that homeownership is moving further away from young working people.  The social contract that promises each generation a stake in their country is under strain.<\/p>  <p>  What is Fine Gael doing to address this generational crisis?  Since Fine Gael came to power seven years ago, it has launched six separate housing plans and relaunched them countless times.  During that same period, Fine Gael has not built one single affordable home.  In January of this year, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced a three-pronged affordable policy, each prong more blunt than the last.  The first was the Rebuilding Ireland home loan that repackages existing housing authority loan schemes.  Over half the applicants, some 54%, however, have been refused a loan to date, while those who can get one are still competing for the same small supply of homes.<\/p>  <p>  The second blunt prong was the cost rental pilot scheme.  In 2015, the Fine Gael Government committed &euro;10 million to a cost rental pilot project.  This was reheated in January by the Minister, even though the project has yet to go to tender or have any guiding income criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The third blunt failure was the affordable purchase scheme.  This scheme sees &euro;25 million committed to serving State-owned land for building affordable homes in co-operation with local authorities.  Six local authorities built no homes at all last year.  The Government has failed to deliver with programmes such as repair and lease.  The lack of specific targets in each area means that this plan is doomed to fail before it even gets going.  The lack of affordable housing scheme demonstrates the sheer incompetence and inertia that governs the Department.<\/p>  <p>  All the while, the Government has not put its money where its mouth is.  Despite the fanfare around the capital plan, the allocated capital budget for housing is still 24%, or &euro;225 million, behind 2008 levels.  Still, there is no definition of what is an affordable home.  In the face of these ballooning property prices, Fine Gael has, at best, engaged in token gesture policies and, at worst, ignored a growing chasm in the property market.<\/p>  <p>  Tonight&rsquo;s Fianna F&aacute;il motion sets down a marker.  It will re-orientate the Government towards addressing the affordability gap that is swallowing up a generation.  That must be placed at the heart of policy.  We believe the State has a central role to play in delivering homes that someone on the average industrial wage can afford.  Homeownership cannot be allowed to become the preserve of the few or the old.  The next generation must get their chance to have a stake in their communities.  The State owns and controls enough zoned land to build 114,000 dwellings, half of which can be affordable homes.  Drawing on NAMA and local authority data, it is calculated the State controls over 3,000 ha of zoned land for housing across the country.<\/p><p>This total is made up of 1,691 ha controlled by NAMA and more than 1,300 ha controlled by local authorities.<\/p> <p> This means that more than 48,000 homes could be built on council-owned zoned land and more than 65,000 homes could be built on NAMA-controlled land.  We need driving ambition to realise the potential of these lands, an ambition that is sorely lacking in the Government.<\/p> <p> The new State-led scheme that Fianna F&aacute;il will propose will set specific local authority targets and establish a special purpose vehicle to finance the scheme along with State capital investment and re-investment of the proceeds of sales into building further homes.<\/p> <p> This will create a small, efficient and focused housing delivery agency to monitor and deliver housing and quality.  There will be localised income thresholds to reflect different circumstances in each area and a 50,000 unit target over a term of government.  This compares favourably with the 10,000 target in the Fine Gael scheme.  The people know the Government will not deliver on the target of 10,000 based on its abject failure to date.  Fianna F&aacute;il will press the Government for a clear commitment on this in the upcoming budget negotiations.  The State should initiate the scheme with upfront and ongoing investment taking place on a sustainable off-balance-sheet basis.<\/p> <p> Addressing the growing gap between homeowners and renters will be the defining challenge of this D&aacute;il, one that will have profound long-lasting effects.  This motion is a small step towards that end.  It is time for the Government to replace spin with bricks and mortar and get affordable homes built.  Anything else will be a major social and economic failure.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister initiate an affordable housing scheme?  When will the Minister commence an affordable rental scheme?  When will construction commence?  People do not want any more press launches, photo opportunities or nice colour brochures.  They simply want homes to live in.  They want affordable homes that will provide hope for a generation condemned to out-of-control rents in Ireland.  They deserve a great deal better than this.  They deserve a great deal better than this Government as well.  The Government must act now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600062#PPP01000","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526497200,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I welcome tonight's motion on affordable housing, which has been brought forward by my colleague, Deputy O'Brien.  Affordable housing is an area of the systemic housing crisis that has been consistently overlooked by the Government, yet it remains an essential keystone in the solution of delivering homes for all our people.<\/p>  <p>  It is an historical fact that there is an embedded and consistent ambition within Irish people to own their own homes.  For generations of Irish people, that ambition has been the core aspect of the social contract between the people and the governing system.  One of the measures of the success or otherwise of our independent nation has been the capacity of people to own a home, raise families and have substantial ownership in our society.<\/p>  <p>  Since the previous Fine Gael-led Government abolished the affordable homes scheme in 2011, it has regrettably but predictably contributed to the unsustainable growth in house prices.  This has arisen due to a lack of supply and a minimalist approach taken by the Government to encouraging - never mind supplying - affordable homes to the thousands of people who need them.<\/p>  <p>  Only recently, Fine Gael attempted to expand the affordable home loan scheme through each local authority.  Yet, we need only look at the example of County Wicklow.  Government data reveal only two successful applications in Wicklow in the two years since the Government was formed.  That is a shambolic result.<\/p>  <p>  The capping of supports for house buyers in Wicklow and the income thresholds involved are forcing many people who were born and bred in Wicklow and who want to own homes in their communities to be priced out of their home county.  Wicklow is being gentrified by cash-rich middle-class Dublin.  Maybe this is the Fine Gael master plan.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has consistently called for the full implementation of the cross-party report on the housing crisis that calls for a housing agency to take full charge of all aspects of our broken housing system.  We will insist on independent verifiable data on affordability in each county, thereby informing the public policy response required in each county where prices can be extremely varied.  We will also impose targets for each county on the numbers of affordable units to be supplied.  Failure will result in immediate support responses from central government.<\/p>  <p>  A crisis demands an emergency response.  We will deliver affordable houses for Irish people to purchase in every county in Ireland.  We will do so through the State directly building homes, where possible, on State lands, and by accessing off-balance-sheet finance.  We will do what the State should be doing, that is to say, governing on behalf of all the people and not only the chosen few.<\/p>  <p>  The political establishment in Ireland has failed the people again in the manner in which our housing crisis is being spun but not analysed, manipulated but not managed, debated but never delivered.  We all know where this road ends.  It ends with failure.  It ends with people losing the limited faith they have in the ability of politics to address the needs of all our people.<\/p>  <p>  It is not too late to put in place an affordable housing system that is vested in our State and that allows us to frequently put housing policies under the microscope of the people.  The upcoming budget must deliver on affordable housing.  The people demand nothing less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600063#QQQ00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1526497200,"counter":731,"content":"<p>This afternoon I met representatives from ICTU to discuss the housing crisis.  For their members, the issues of pay restoration and changes in terms and conditions, as well as all the normal union matters, will count for little if they cannot put roofs over their heads through purchasing a home or at the least gaining secure tenancy.  The issue of affordability is key to what was in their minds.  While they acknowledged that schemes were up and running again in certain parts of the country, few of these schemes could be chalked down as affordable or within the purchasing power of union members.<\/p>  <p>  I see it in my native county.  Developers are seeking to get schemes progressed but we are talking about high-end developments.  They will not provide starter homes for people in their 20s or 30s.  This goes to the heart of what we are discussing with Deputy Darragh O'Brien's motion, that is to say, affordability.<\/p>  <p>  I witnessed something interesting this week that needs to be addressed as part of the conversation about developing much-needed affordable homes.  At a county council meeting this week in my native county of Meath, an addendum item appeared on the agenda.  The notice related to a &euro;2.3 million loan to buy land in order that 55 county council houses could be built in Ashbourne.  It sounds like a good news story in the round.  The proposal is in a town where a large number of people are trying to obtain housing either on the county council waiting list or the private housing market.  Instead, the reaction from locals on social media on the evening of the meeting was one of outrage and sheer anger.  People were branding this a disgrace and asked whether the councillors were out of their minds.  Why would anyone be against housing?  It was because they made the point that the town, which is the second largest in the county and the fastest-growing in the area, has no green area for locals and there is a lack of amenities for the vast population that exists here and now and that has emerged over a ten-year period.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, we have locals coming together to try to stop this development before it ever gets going.  The lack of investment from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in tandem with the channelling of funds to local authorities to meet the needs of the population that exists here and now has led to a backlash from these communities when it comes to any new houses being built, whether private, social or affordable.  They are objecting to bricks and mortar because they believe their community is not being resourced.  No one is catering for the people whose families are there at present.<\/p>  <p>  We are entering a dangerous space, one to which the Department needs to front-up.  I have been raising this for years.  At a time when there is a housing crisis and we need to see affordable homes built, we have communities rising up and objecting to housing developments because of a lack of amenities and green areas.  They will send these projects to planning appeals and delay them.  Then the Government will have an even greater problem.  It is one that frankly the Government deserves because it has not addressed the sheer lack of resourcing these councils face.  Consequently, the councils are unable to provide the facilities that they need in tandem with affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  Those in government may bury their heads in the sand, decide to disregard such people and plough on but these people are real.  The comments of these people in these communities were insightful.  This was not a matter of politicians throwing scuds.  These are ordinary people living in a community where housing is needed.  They said they would not allow the project because the people who live there here and now are not being looked after.  That is a quandary but one that can only be solved by addressing the reality that investment needs to take place.  The Government cannot blame development plans.<\/p><p>Counties such as Meath, Wicklow and Kildare, where the population has exploded, receive low levels of funding <i>per capita<\/i>from the Department, with County Meath at the bottom of the list.  In addressing the requirement to provide affordable homes, the Department must focus on creating communities rather than concrete jungles.  If people do not get their heads around that, last Monday's experience in Ashbourne will be repeated across the country and act as an impediment to building affordable homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600063#QQQ00300","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526497800,"counter":733,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Darragh O'Brien on tabling the motion.  I will focus on two points in the short time available.  On the issue of affordable housing, Deputy O'Brien referred to the home loans provided under Rebuilding Ireland.  The affordable loans scheme is a farce because no approvals are coming through.  This new mechanism, which is intended to help people on lower incomes to secure housing by providing home loans, sounded good when it was first announced and in the subsequent press release.  However, it is simply not working and anyone who argues otherwise is mistaken.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is relying heavily on the private market to ensure people have a roof over their heads.  In a small number of cases, landlords are experiencing severe difficulty when they use the machinery of the State to resolve disputes about the payment or non-payment of rent.  The mechanisms in place are being blatantly disregarded, with some people failing to appear for arbitration.  A holistic approach is needed to ensure everyone - landlords and tenants - is protected because we have a national crisis.  A small number of cases have been brought to my attention recently and they must be addressed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600064#RRR00200","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1526497800,"counter":734,"content":"<p>The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, are both well aware that an increasing number of people who are not eligible for social housing cannot afford to buy a home.  The reason is that house price inflation is outpacing wage inflation.  The Ministers are aware of this development because they responded to it in Rebuilding Ireland by introducing a home loans scheme.  While the scheme is fine insofar as it goes, the problem is that it does not provide for an increase in supply and it is the lack of supply that has created the current problem in the housing sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's amendment refers to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and so forth.  The policy document, Rebuilding Ireland, is two years old.  LIHAF was first announced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in October 2016 when he allocated &euro;50 million to the scheme, yet two years later only &euro;1.6 million or &euro;1.7 million has been drawn down.  We have not seen any urgency demonstrated in respect of this project.  The Department is stalling a programme that should be rolled out in a much more timely fashion.  In advance of the announcement of Rebuilding Ireland two years ago, the Joint Committee on Housing and Homelessness expressed serious concern that the Department would not have sufficient capacity to roll out the necessary programme and called for the establishment of a national housing body. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Darragh O'Brien referred to off-balance sheet investment or funding for housing.  This form of investment has a role to play in the provision of affordable housing and the cost rental market.  However, it has not developed in the way in should have developed.  These issues have been identified and debated in the House time and again, yet no action has been taken to address them.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, which Deputy &Oacute; Broin also serves, a strategic development zone, SDZ, is being developed with nearly 8,500 housing units.  While the SDZ plan includes sufficient capacity and detail to provide social and affordable housing, Government intervention is needed to make clear which funding mechanism will facilitate this development.  There are numerous opportunities in the greater Dublin area to develop schemes of this nature but they require immediate and direct Government intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600064#RRR00300","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1526497800,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:&quot;notes that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the economic downturn had a very significant impact on housing supply and the construction industry, with housing construction falling by over 90% between the peak in 2006 and the trough in 2013;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; with the economy returning to significant and consistent growth, and with the unemployment rate at 5.9% in April, its lowest since May 2008, a significant increase in new homes is needed; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government, having regard to this, has made the delivery of new homes, social, affordable and private, a top priority through the development, resourcing and implementation of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; in this regard, the Government&rsquo;s initial focus has been on delivering homes for households in the lowest income brackets, through the commitment of over &euro;6 billion to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes by 2021, with qualifying households also able to avail of the housing assistance payment, the rental accommodation scheme and other targeted programmes, with the aim of meeting the housing needs of over 137,000 households by the end of 2021;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; through concerted efforts by Government agencies, local authorities and non-governmental organisations, the housing needs of households in emergency accommodation or at risk of becoming homeless continue to be addressed, through a wide range of support programmes, as well as helping the most vulnerable, rough-sleeping homeless through the Housing First initiative which enables people, who may have been homeless and who have a high level of complex needs, to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the  provision of intensive supports to help them maintain their tenancies;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; almost 26,000 households had their social housing needs met in 2017, exceeding the target set by 23%, and almost doubling the levels achieved in 2015;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the social housing construction programme included some 850 schemes, or phases, with 13,400 homes in the pipeline, at the end of 2017, representing a very substantial increase of almost 5,000 new homes being progressed, compared with the 8,430 homes in the programme one year earlier; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; at the end of 2017, some 2,512 homes were completed, 3,650 were under construction and 1,912 further homes were about to go on site, with the remainder progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; notwithstanding the responsibility of each chief executive for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of their respective local authority, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has, since 1 January 2015, approved 793 housing-related staff sanction requests from local authorities, and that additional supports are also being made available to local authorities to meet staffing costs associated with the delivery of their social housing build programmes; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has also implemented a suite of measures to facilitate increased residential construction activity and ensure the sector&rsquo;s capacity to produce more affordable homes, through, <i>inter alia<\/i>:<blockquote>&mdash; fast-track planning reforms and more flexible planning guidelines;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; &euro;200 million investment in enabling infrastructure to service-open up housing lands with proportionate affordability dividends for house purchasers; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the progression of large-scale mixed-tenure housing projects, with social, affordable and private housing, on publicly-owned lands;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government has also introduced targeted and time-bound measures to limit excessive rent increases, for example, through rent pressure zones, and to provide further <br \/><br \/>protections and effective support services to both tenants and landlords;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in budget 2018, significant obstacles to building more homes more quickly were removed, by:<blockquote>&mdash; investing more capital funding in direct house building by the State; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; removing the Capital Gains Tax incentive to hold on to residential land, as well as escalating penalties for land hoarding; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; providing a new, more affordable finance vehicle for builders through House Building Finance Ireland;<\/blockquote>&mdash; these measures are having a positive impact, with all relevant indicators clearly showing that the supply-based measures under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness are working, with latest planning permissions and commencements data both up 27% year-on-year and registrations up 41%;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; having recognised the affordability pressures faced by some households, particularly in the major urban centres, the Government announced a further package of measures in January, with the potential to deliver more than 3,000 new homes initially and a target for at least 10,000 new affordable homes to buy and rent; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the new measures are targeted at low- to moderate-income households, with annual gross income of up to &euro;50,000 for single-income households and &euro;75,000 for dual-income households;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; up to the end of October of last year, two thirds, or over 5,300 homes, of the overall number of houses purchased by first-time buyers in the greater Dublin area, Cork and Galway were purchased for less than &euro;320,000, and that across the rest of the country, just over 90%, or 3,380 homes, of the overall number of houses purchased by first-time buyers were purchased for less than &euro;250,000;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was made available from 1 February 2018, providing long-term, fixed-rate mortgages for first-time buyers; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; in 2011, reflecting the reality of market conditions across the country at that time when house prices fell by some 50% and the consequent significant easing of affordability in that period, all affordable housing schemes were stood down, and a new affordable purchase scheme is being established very shortly, that will see affordable homes built initially on State land, in co-operation with local authorities, with affordable housing targets to be published shortly;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; &euro;75 million of additional Exchequer funding is being made available for enabling infrastructure, including to facilitate affordable housing provision, with a particular focus on our cities where the affordability challenge is greatest; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s ambition is to make cost rental a major part of the housing system, with rents set at levels to cover construction costs and the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal retained profit margin and this will be informed by a pilot project being progressed in Dublin at Enniskerry Road, Sandyford;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; detailed discussions are continuing with the European Investment Bank regarding the application of its international experiences in developing and supporting affordable housing to large-scale cost rental projects in Ireland;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the publication of new build to rent and co-living planning guidelines will encourage development and investment in more rental accommodation at more affordable rents; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government has committed to establish a new national regeneration and development agency, including consideration of how best to make State lands available, including suitable lands in the control and ownership of Government Departments and State agencies, to the new body for, <i>inter alia<\/i>, affordable residential development.&quot;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I welcome any opportunity to discuss housing issues in the Chamber.  While I always try to be constructive in my engagements, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party motion makes it difficult to do so because it lacks all credibility.  Either Fianna F&aacute;il is aware of its recent role in the over-leveraging of the housing sector that destroyed the economy and simply wants to ignore it and spin tales to members of the public, which they will not fall for, or, worse, it does not recognise the mistakes it made in the recent past and does not understand what it did wrong.  It is ten years since the financial crisis, eight years since we lost our economic sovereignty and four years since we got it back.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is clearly not ready for office if this motion is anything to go by.  We have a serious housing crisis which was caused by 13 years of Fianna F&aacute;il in power.  It is this crisis that the Government of Fine Gael and Independents is trying to fix.  It appears from the motion that Fianna F&aacute;il is completely blind to that fact. <\/p><p>Let us examine the introductory calls made in the motion.  It notes that &quot;the affordable housing scheme was stood down by the Fine Gael-Labour Government in 2011&quot;.  The scheme was stood down in 2011 because it was unnecessary, the reason being that housing prices had fallen by 50% and the value of some land portfolios had fallen by as much as 80%.  Hundreds of thousands of people were plunged into negative equity, causing major distress in their lives.  Affordability was simply not an issue.  Do the Deputies opposite not remember this?  Do they need me to explain that the housing sector imploded under the most recent Fianna F&aacute;il Government?  Building activity declined by 90% in that time and almost two thirds of builders lost their jobs as a result.  Do the Deputies opposite need me to remind the House that their party's housing policies and tax incentives throughout the 2000s blew a hole in the public finances, which bankrupted the country and resulted in the loss of our economic sovereignty?<\/p><p>An interesting subsequent clause in the motion refers to the &quot;Residential Tenancies Board third quarter of 2017 rent index&quot;.  Are the Deputies opposite aware that we have had a fourth quarter report which confirmed that rent pressure zones were having an impact, driving inflation in Dublin down 3% on 2016?  Do they accept that rent pressure zones are working?  They must do so because today the Fianna F&aacute;il Party introduced a Bill that proposes to extend these zones to student accommodation.<\/p><p>While the motion makes reference to rents in the fourth quarter of last year, it compares them to rents in 2011.  Why has 2011 been chosen as a comparative year?  Is it because it was the year Fine Gael and the Labour Party entered government to clean up the mess left by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments and to allow the dramatic increase in rents in the intervening period to be blamed on us?  In 2011, we commenced the bailout.  Hundreds of thousands of people had to emigrate, we had 3,000 ghost estates, rents tanked and house prices continued to fall.  It would take a further three years to exit the bailout and a further seven years to balance the public finances and get everyone back to work.  We achieved this only this year and we did so without the need for a second bailout and faster than anyone had predicted. <\/p><p>The years since Fine Gael assumed responsibility for the economy have been a success in economic terms.  However, in terms of housing, we are now facing a great social cost and suffering arising from that success.  These are compounded by the under-supply that preceded 2011.  Surely the broken housing sector, which is now being fixed, is the long sting in the tail for a country that was so badly let down by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party's 13-year reign.  Our difficulties manifest themselves most severely and distressingly in the large number of homeless families in emergency accommodation tonight who are not mentioned in the motion.<\/p><p>The motion condemns the failure to build affordable homes since 2011.  Is that a joke?  The average price of a house nationally in 2011 was roughly &euro;228,000.  In 2012, house prices continued to fall and the average price house nationally reached &euro;203,000.  In 2013, the figure increased to &euro;206,000 and increased again to &euro;215,000 the following year.  It was only later that house prices began to creep up above the &euro;300,000 mark in places like Dublin.  Even now, figures for Dublin show that up to the end of October 2017, two thirds of the overall number of homes purchased by first-time buyers in the greater Dublin area, Cork and Galway sold for less than &euro;320,000.  Everywhere else in the country, approximately 90% of first-time buyers bought homes for less than &euro;250,000.  These are the figures for the period leading up to October last year.<\/p><p>Affordable homes are being built and sold even today.  The Government recognises, however, that we are still not building enough homes.  What has not helped is the number of developers and small builders who were put of business by the collapse of the construction sector under Fianna F&aacute;il's watch.  Do the Deputies opposite remember the National Asset Management Agency and the &euro;32 billion in debt foisted on the backs of taxpayers?  Do they remember all the small construction companies that folded and builders who had to emigrate?  They are still struggling to get back on their feet but with new initiatives from the Government, for example, Home Building Finance Ireland, we will help them. <\/p><p>When the Fianna F&aacute;il Party states no affordable homes have been built since 2011, it is simply wrong.  Our problem for much of the past seven years has not been affordability of homes but the reverse.  We are now confronted with supply and affordability problems and the Government is fixing these as a priority.  We launched a number of affordability measures last year.  They include the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, to which previous speakers referred, the introduction of a successful fast-track process and new apartment guidelines which will drive down costs and rent pressure zones, which Fianna F&aacute;il supports and recognises are working - hence the legislation it introduced today.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, I launched three new affordability measures.  A number of successful applicants have been approved under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, although drawdown has not yet taken place because a couple of months are needed to find a home and secure agreement on sale.  The affordable purchase scheme, which was also mentioned, was launched in January and we will also introduce cost rental projects at scale thanks to our partners in the European Investment Bank.  We will build on these measures with further details under Project Ireland 2040 and these will be announced very soon.<\/p><p>The Deputy condemned the delays in undertaking an affordable pilot scheme since it was announced in 2015.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien may not be aware of this but that scheme was stood down and the money was put into emergency accommodation.  The scheme was a subsidy-based scheme and the new Government in 2016, which took over the housing portfolio from the Labour Party, decided it was better to use land to achieve affordability - State land to drive cost rental and other measures.  That is how we are now proceeding.  That is what has been recommended by all of the experts outside of Government.<\/p> <p> The Deputy then goes on to condemn the lack of specific targets, dates and locations for affordable homes under the affordable purchase scheme that I announced in January last.  Rebuilding Ireland is a five-year plan to rebuild the housing sector and is a &euro;6 billion commitment to 50,000 social housing homes.  We are almost two years in and are ahead of our targets.  Our initial focus was on restarting local authority house building and on delivering more emergency accommodation.  That building was restarted last year when three times as many social housing homes were built as in the year before.  This year, we will double that number.  It is right that we focused our attention initially on those who need our help the most.  Would Deputy Darragh O'Brien have done it any differently?  Otherwise, we would not have solutions such as Housing First, like a national director of Housing First or a 40% decrease in the number of those sleeping rough on our streets.<\/p> <p> I stated when I took office that affordability would be a priority of mine.  That is why I secured in last year's budget negotiations &euro;75 million for new affordability measures that are being developed now.  All Deputy Darragh O'Brien's party looked for was tax breaks for developers - the same old story.  Already, we have identified through finance or land the potential for at least 4,000 affordable homes, rising to 10,000, and the targets, locations and dates are coming soon.  I hope to see the first affordable purchase scheme homes being tenanted before the end of the year.  That is only the beginning of our ambition.  That is only what we propose to do with local authority land.<\/p> <p> Deputy Darragh O'Brien then goes on to condemn the capital spend on housing when compared with the 2008 levels.  I do not why the Deputy persists with this.  How is 2008, the year of our financial crisis, two years before our bailout, a reasonable year of comparison?  We lost our economic sovereignty precisely because our spending commitments were built upon unsustainable Government finances.  We were building probably twice as many homes as were needed.  How is this a comparison?  Interestingly, local authorities were not building anything then.  Fianna F&aacute;il had taken local authorities out of the building game long before the crash.  It is 16 years since a local authority in Wicklow built a home but that will change this year under our Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il is the party that got local authorities out of house building and Fine Gael and the Independents in government are getting them back into house building.<\/p> <p> The Deputy calls on me to equip the new regeneration and development agency with an affordable housing remit.  We have already stated that we are doing that.  He states that there should be an affordable housing scheme on income criteria with repayments being no more than 35% of income.  We are already doing that with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  The Deputy calls on me to review and upgrade local authority staffing capacity.  Since January of 2015, we have approved more than 790 housing-related staff for local authorities up and down the country and at the second housing summit this year I stated, \"Appoint more and we will pay for them.\"<\/p> <p> The Deputy calls on me to expedite cost rental across the country.  I am glad that Fianna F&aacute;il is finally waking up to the importance of cost rental as a model.  We will introduce it.  We are working on a pilot of scale right now with the European Investment Bank and Dublin City Council.  Cost rental needs to become a major part of the rental market.  However, I will not try to fool the public.  I will not make empty promises.  Cost rental, if it is to be done right, needs to be piloted properly.  Transforming our rental landscape cannot be achieved overnight when supply is still so tight.  I recognise there is still a serious undersupply of housing but all the indicators are pointing positively in the right direction.  Commencement notices have increased by 41%, planning permissions by 27% and connections to the ESB by 30%.<\/p> <p> The Central Bank forecasts that 23,000 homes will be built this year and 27,000 homes in 2019.  I hope it is correct because that is well ahead of our targets under Rebuilding Ireland.  There have even been increases in the labour force, which was up at least 14% at the beginning of 2017.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's fast-track process has already seen approvals for over 6,000 new places to live.  As all those homes are built, we will deliver further affordability.<\/p> <p> A lot more has to be done.  Under Rebuilding Ireland and Project Ireland 2040, we have the vision, and thanks to the prudent management of our finances, we have the money.  Now we need to drive delivery and implementation.  New structures, such as the housing summits, do that, as does the new delivery unit headed up by the Minister of State, Deputy English, in my Department.<\/p> <p> There is still more to come.  A new agency, not some monitoring quango such as Deputy Darragh O'Brien suggests in his motion but something real with teeth, is coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600064#RRR00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526498400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>That will be a first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600065#SSS00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1526498400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>We are still waiting for the Deputy's great big housing policy announcement, although I have heard on enough occasions that it is coming.

The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, started by stating that the broken housing system is now being fixed.  The problem, of course, is the facts tell a very different story.  The affordable housing crisis is, in fact, getting worse.  House prices are rising, rents across the country are rising, home repossessions are increasing and notices to quit and homeless presentations are continuing to increase.  None of those are signs that the broken housing system is being fixed.  None of that is surprising.<\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland contains no affordable housing scheme, no targets for the delivery of affordable rental or purchase homes, and no dedicated funding stream to deliver those much needed homes.  Indeed, many of the measures the Minister discussed that the Government has introduced on the back of Rebuilding Ireland have either had no impact on affordability or in some instances are making matters worse.  Let us have a look at that list of schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Help to buy was introduced and there is some evidence to suggest that it is pushing up house prices and that the majority of those who are benefitting from that scheme did not need taxpayers' assistance to purchase their homes in the first place.  New apartment guidelines have generated strong opinion that they will push up apartment and house prices because they will increase the value of the land and, therefore, the ultimate price of the units on it.  While strategic housing developments will increase the delivery of private homes, there is no evidence to suggest that in and of itself, it will generate or assist affordability.<\/p>  <p>  Then we have the land initiatives - this flagship project of Rebuilding Ireland.  It is incredibly slow.  Local authorities lose control over the nature of the mixed tenure that is in the developments, suiting the market rather than the needs of local communities, and there is no guarantee in any of the land initiative projects currently under negotiation by either Dublin city or south Dublin that affordability of any measure will be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF, this wonderful project the intention of which the Minister seems to be repeatedly revising.  We are now told that was never an affordability scheme and it was always merely about unblocking private sector development stuck for lack infrastructure funding when, in fact, Rebuilding Ireland, if one reads it, stated it was both.  When one sees what has been agreed in so-called affordability discounts on the back of &euro;200,000 of taxpayers' money under the Department's detailed breakdown - released in very small letters which were difficult for many of us to read without a magnifying glass - it is not encouraging.  If one takes, for example, the private sector LIHAF developments, the average price of the discounted units at 2017 prices is &euro;250,000, which does not take account of inflation by the time those houses are on the market and for sale.  In almost every local authority area where there is a LIHAF-funded scheme, one can buy houses cheaper than would be delivered benefitting from LIHAF.  In Dublin city and county, it is even worse.  The average price of the discounted houses at 2017 prices is &euro;318,000 but, of course, that will go up another 10% or 20% between now and when the houses are sold.  What is worse is when one looks at what is being delivered in terms of affordability in LIHAF on mixed use or public land.  There is either no agreement on affordability, particularly on the bigger sites in the likes of Cherrywood, The Grange or the strategic development zone, SDZ, in my own constituency, or the house prices are far above what is affordable for ordinary people.  The facts from the Government's own figures show that it will not work.<\/p>  <p>  Home Building Finance Ireland, I stated at the time of the budget, is a good initiative.  The problem is it has not happened yet and we do not know when it will happen.  The Government has this tendency of making an announcement and then repeating it as if what was announced has happened.  We need to see the legislation.  We need to see how it will operate.  Crucially, we need to see how those loans will be linked to the delivery of genuinely affordable homes.<\/p>  <p>  On the revised council mortgage, I praised the fact that it had a lower fixed interest rate but that mortgage is of no use if people cannot access affordable homes to buy with it.  In many of the areas of the greatest need for affordable housing, that loan, good and all as it is in design, will be of little benefit.<\/p>  <p>  On the rent pressure zones, I listened carefully to the Minister today.  It was as he stated on promised legislation last week.  In fact, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, fourth quarter index he quoted shows that the rent pressure zones are not working.  The figures show the annual increase across the State is 6%.  In 22 of the Twenty-six Counties, on the basis of the RTB's fourth quarter figures, the rental increase was above the 4% cap.  There is no evidence that the cap is working for rents, and particularly new rents.  Of course, the issue of student accommodation is particularly acute.<\/p><p>If the Minister would simply clarify whether student licences are covered under the Residential Tenancies Act, it would be very welcome.  If they are not, he should include amendments to his Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill to clarify that issue.  <\/p> <p> One of the few decent initiatives in terms of the potential to deliver genuinely affordable homes was the &euro;25 million for &Oacute; Cualann-type developments.  I welcomed it at the time.  The problem is nothing has happened with it.  The Minister keeps telling us the scheme is coming.  The frustrating thing is the Minister does not need to design a new affordable housing scheme.  We know the income limits.  We know the eligibility criteria.  A circular just needs to be issued to local authorities and then that money can start to be drawn down.  While I know the proposal, as it was being discussed some months ago, was for 75% of the cost of the land and the site development to be offset for the local authority, with that fund, 100% would be much better.  <\/p> <p> The really remarkable thing is when we take all of these schemes together, what we see is the private sector-led interventions will receive over &euro;1 billion of taxpayers' money.  The one bit of real investment in affordable housing is only a measly &euro;25 million.  It shows very clearly, in this as is in so many areas of Government policy, that the over-reliance on the private sector to deliver social and affordable homes is where the Government's policy focus is at and that is why it is not working.<\/p> <p> I do not say this lightly but after two years of Fine Gael housing Ministers, it is clear they are neither interested in nor capable of delivering genuinely affordable, rental and purchase homes on the scale that is needed to tackle the crisis.  Is it any wonder the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has resorted to manipulating the homelessness figures in a desperate attempt to save face?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600065#SSS00900","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I have to object to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":747,"content":"<p>Something-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":748,"content":"<p>That is a very unfair comment to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Something we will deal with-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":750,"content":"<p>On a point of order-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT00600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":751,"content":"<p>It is something we will deal with-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT00700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":752,"content":"<p>On a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT00800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":753,"content":"<p>There is no point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT00900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":754,"content":"<p>-----in the housing committee tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600066#TTT01000","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499000,"counter":755,"content":"<p>That is very unfair.

Let us look at Fianna F&aacute;il's record.  Over those 14 years, it delivered on average 5,500 real social houses a year.  That is less than the current Government is delivering.  During that same period of time, the number of subsidised private rental tenancies for social housing actually increased.  They increased beyond recognition.  By the end of the period of time, there was almost a 500% increase in using private rental sector accommodation for social housing tenants.  Housing waiting lists increased by 258% and shared ownership schemes, which the Deputy was so fond of, actually left almost 50% of the households with those mortgages in substantial mortgage distress.  It is no wonder Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to support Fine Gael's policy.  All it is doing is continuing the broad policy framework that Fianna F&aacute;il was responsible for when it was last in government.  Probably the worst thing is Fianna F&aacute;il keeps telling Sinn F&eacute;in that it did the responsible thing and supported this Government yet at no stage has it actually used the leverage it claims to have to get the Government to do anything different.

We think it is eminently achievable with both Exchequer revenue and other sources such as credit union and the Housing Finance Agency.

We are happy to work with it to ensure it has the right design.  It needs to deliver homes, not at &euro;320,000, but for families between &euro;35,000 and &euro;75,000 a year at genuinely affordable prices.  That is somewhere between &euro;170,000 and &euro;280,000.  Many local authorities still do not have enough staff and there needs to be additional resourcing for that.  Crucially we need to reduce the length of time it takes to deliver social and affordable homes.  The 18-month approval, tendering and procurement process is simply too long and must be reduced, not to the 12 months the Government is currently targeting but below that.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to see the fast-tracking of the home building finance Ireland legislation.  I know it is not the Minister's portfolio.  It is under the Department of Finance.  It is something the House agrees on and would work constructively with the Government on if it was laid before the House.  We also need to be much more proactive with the credit unions.  It is almost four months since the Central Bank made its decision to allow credit union finance into social housing.  If that money was released it would free up Exchequer revenue to put into affordable housing and yet little action is being taken by either the Department of Finance or the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on it.  We need a coherent and proactive plan by the Minister's Department and the Department of Finance to get approved housing bodies back off balance sheet.  My understanding is since redesignation has happened, there have been no meetings with the approved housing body sector to address these issues.  We need to ensure that no LIHAF funding is given to any development that does not deliver some coherent level of affordability at affordable prices.  <\/p>  <p>  What real Opposition parties must do is in the run up to budget 2019 is say what they would do differently in government.  They should say it not only in rhetoric but in concrete measures with proposed expenditure that is fully accounted for.  That is what a real Opposition party does.  It is not what is in this motion today.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in certainly will not be supporting it.

This is a very disappointing motion.  We have had several very constructive debates in this House with people across parties where we have tried to tease out the various complex issues that arise in respect of the housing crisis.  This motion is just designed to be sabre-rattling to indicate somehow or other that Fianna F&aacute;il has loads of muscle to stand up to Fine Gael and that it is planning an election at some stage in the year to come.  One would never think it is in a confidence and supply situation where it can use real power in the lead-up to the budget by putting figures on this issue.  It is the woolliest motion I have read in a long time.  Even the proposals are general, for example, \"earmark an additional capital investment for a State-led affordable housing scheme in 2019\", etc., with no figures or anything else, or \"expedite the establishment of a cost rental model across the country with clear localised income criteria and location targets\".  We had a very good debate on cost rental a couple of weeks ago with very specific proposals and many contributions.  Another proposal in the motion states: \"utilise State and local-authority owned lands in the development of social and affordable units.&rdquo;  That is everybody's policy but it is entirely non-specific.  Is Deputy O'Brien saying all the land should be utilised for social and affordable housing?  If he was, we would support him.  As far as I can see Fianna F&aacute;il's policy is similar to Fine Gael's policy, which is to use most of that land for market priced houses and only a relatively small percentage for social and affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600067#UUU00100","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499600,"counter":810,"content":"<p>It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600067#UUU00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1526499600,"counter":811,"content":"<p>If the Deputy meant something different, he should have specified something different because this is entirely woolly and general.

We had no money whatsoever following the collapse of the economy.  The construction-led boom left houses in places where nobody wanted to live.  One of the big jobs I had when I came into that Department was to deal with ghost estates.  I chaired a committee in the Custom House where there were representatives of various bodies, including the construction industry, etc.  We had to deal with houses nobody wanted to live in because they were built in places where there were tax breaks and in counties where there were too many houses.  The local authorities had been starved of funding.  They had been taken out of the construction business and the private market was providing the rented houses to meet the social need.  That was what we inherited.  We had no money to spend because of the troika and the bank guarantee, and the State was trying to deal with the mess it had inherited.  We were dealing with budgets where we literally did not have any money to spend on houses.  The only thing I could think of doing at the time was to use the small sum of money that I could scrape together to set up a void scheme.

Deputy Darragh O'Brien admits that in his motion where he states: \"Dublin&rsquo;s residential property prices have increased 90.6% from their February 2012 low\".  They were at a low in 2012 and that is why the affordable housing scheme was stood down.  Nobody was building.  Let us be realistic: the Minister said the average price of a house in 2012 was &euro;203,000 and Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to reinvent history by somehow trying to make a comparison with 2011, as if the economy was the same in 2011 as it is now.  A great deal of work had to be done to bring the economy back.  Housing is playing catch-up and that needs to speed up.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's response is too slow.  It needs to move quickly.

It recalls the launch of the St. Michael's Estate public housing on public land initiative last Thursday week.<\/p><p>At that time, when pressed by Vincent Browne on whether he supports public housing on public land at St. Michael's Estate, Deputy Darragh O'Brien replied \"Yes\" and he also said that a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator had spoken to the St. Michael's Estate regeneration group.  When Vincent Browne then asked whether he would support a national campaign for public housing on public lands, the Deputy dodged the issue and would not give a commitment in respect of it.  We sort of agreed that we could put forward a Private Members' Bill on the policy in this regard being brought centre stage in the context of the Government's overall housing policy.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, visited St. Michael's Estate this morning and met the regeneration team, the members of which presented to him a breakthrough model to deliver superb affordable village homes for Inchicore.  Inchicore neighbours are working together to secure affordable, energy-smart homes to improve the locality and the amenities.  I am pleased to support and work with the St. Michael's Estate regeneration team.  My home is on Ring Street, Inchicore, which is down the road from St. Michael's Estate.  There is an amazing, empty and secure space of almost 12 acres at St. Michael's Estate in front of the beautifully restored Richmond Barracks and the recently open Goldenbridge cemetery in the heart of Inchicore.  The regeneration team and I believe that there is a wonderful, people-centred way to harness this land, which is owned by all of us - the public.<\/p> <p> At this time of chronic housing shortage, the State should not be giving publicly-owned land to developers but this is what is planned as part of the housing land initiative.  Dublin City Council has selected prime locations in Dublin for development, including St. Michael's Estate.  Within this initiative, the council plans to put these lands out to the market and to seek expressions of interest and development proposals.  The preferred or selected developer will then secure the land and, in return, will be free to build a substantial amount of private housing, with a much smaller proportion of affordable or public housing.<\/p> <p> Earlier today, the Minister of State, Deputy English, in response to a Topical Issue debate on affordable housing put forward by a number of Deputies-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600067#UUU01400","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526500200,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I was one of those Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600068#VVV00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1526500200,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I know that.  The Minister of State said that the council wanted to see housing development on this site on a 30% social, 20% affordable and 50% private basis.  This model is a win-win for developers because the vast majority of the homes will be sold for developer profit.  We have a different vision.  We want the St. Michael's Estate to be retained by the State in order to develop quality, safe, energy-smart public housing that will be affordable to rent for families, young couples and elderly people.  According to the recent ALONE report, many older people are finding it stressful to get rented accommodation and they have no secure tenure into the future.<\/p><p>The St. Michael's Estate plan is a ready-made pilot project to change the way we deliver housing in Ireland.  It would be a game changer if developed nationally over time.  A report published by housing policy expert, Mel Reynolds, last week shows that the housing and homelessness crisis is unnecessary.  He has put together information which indicates that 114,000 dwellings could be built on zoned land owned or controlled by the State.  Within local authorities and NAMA there are over 3,000 ha of such land - 17% of all undeveloped zoned land in the State.  Approximately 70,000 of these dwellings could be built in Dublin, thus eliminating the housing waiting lists of the four Dublin city councils - on which there are 40,000 families and individuals - 7,000 could be built in the constituency of Dublin South-Central and 2,000 in Inchicore.  Only 2,378 houses were built by local authorities and housing bodies in 2016 and 2017, which is 4% of what could be done.  Mel Reynolds has pointed out that if this level of building on public land is implemented, it would have a huge affect on land prices.  This is the reason for the current housing crisis.  The profits of speculators hoarding land come before meeting people's housing needs.  A mass programme of public housing would also hit house prices and rents in the private sector.  This is why it is not happening.  When replying to the Topical Issue debate earlier, the Minister of State said that the Opposition is only interested in social housing and that we do not want private housing.  I do not object to private housing on private land but I do object to private housing on public land, particularly in light of the current housing crisis.<\/p><p>In the few minutes remaining, I would like to read into the record the comments of a young girl named Nicola Quinn who is part of the St. Michael's Estate regeneration team.  Her words epitomise the plight of young people and others who cannot afford to buy the houses being built by private developers and who also cannot afford to rent.  She states:<\/p><blockquote>A NEW PLAN for Inchicore means that ordinary young people like me can dream about renting at a price I can afford.<br \/><br \/>I&rsquo;m 27 years of age. I&rsquo;m a postgraduate student at University.\u00a0I&rsquo;m working with a global engineering company. I have friends and work colleagues from across the globe. I vote.\u00a0I pay taxes. I have opinions, aims and aspirations. I&rsquo;m a young, independent adult.<br \/><br \/>But I am living at home. Going through the same hall door since I was in a school uniform.<br \/><br \/>It&rsquo;s the only living choice I have right now.\u00a0And it&rsquo;s the only choice that thousands more young adults like me have here in Dublin and across the country.\u00a0Eurostat figures in 2016 tell us that a massive one in four Irish adults over 25 are living at home.<br \/><br \/>We are a generation trapped in our box rooms, locked out of the extortionate private rental market and unable to get a start on an out of reach housing ladder for ordinary people.<\/blockquote><p>She goes on to say very eloquently:<\/p><blockquote>I can at last begin to dream that there is a better way to do things, that there is a different way to think and plan for housing that ordinary people like me can aspire to and, above all, afford.<br \/><br \/>For over a year now I have been working with the St Michael&rsquo;s Regeneration Team in Inchicore &ndash; where I grew up.\u00a0I have met with the team every week, as a volunteer, to develop our plan for the 12 acres of green space that is right in the middle of our community.<br \/><br \/>What&rsquo;s really ground-breaking about this proposal and what attracts me most to it is that all of houses on the site would be rented on a long term and secure basis, at a cost that is weighted according to people&rsquo;s ability to pay.\u00a0It&rsquo;s called the cost rental model.\u00a0It&rsquo;s new here in Ireland but it is actually the successful rental model that has been in operation in countries across Europe for decades.<br \/><br \/>So say, you&rsquo;re somebody with an income of about &euro;30,000, your rent for a home suitable to you could be no more than &euro;400 a month.\u00a0Compare that with the &euro;1,600 average it would cost me today to rent a two bedroom apartment off a private landlord or vulture fund in Inchicore and you can see immediately why I&rsquo;m excited about this new, fair rent model. At last, it&rsquo;s a housing model and a rent that I can live with.<\/blockquote><p>This is the reality for many young people, bus services employees, rail services employees, post office employees, Eircom employees and retail outlet employees.  Nicola also states:<\/p><blockquote>Instead, what is proposed with the Fair Rent Model plan for Inchicore is that the 12 acres of public land is retained by the State &ndash; not given away.\u00a0The State builds the homes, which the State continues to own, and then rents these homes to a mix of people &ndash; families, single people, older people &ndash; on a long term and secure basis.<br \/><br \/>The best bit about this proposal is that not only do people like me get the chance and the choice to live at a rent we can afford but that the State can recoup its initial outlay for building the homes.<br \/><br \/>So, at St Michael&rsquo;s Estate, for example, if there were 300 one, two and three bedroom homes rented out, the State could expect to earn over &euro;2 million every year &ndash; meaning that over a 25 or 30 year period the community would pay for itself.<\/blockquote><p>This proposal has to be piloted on St. Michael's Estate.  Councillors and the community can discuss the details in further detail.  There are already 55 new houses in Thornton Heights and an old folks development is under way at site B on St. Michael's Estate.  This can be a game changer for ordinary people who are priced out of the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600068#VVV00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1526500200,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I have spoken in this Chamber many times about the current housing crisis.  We need to relieve pressure from people who fear homelessness.  I plead with the Minister to take solid action.  With a staggering number of children living either on our streets or in emergency accommodation, it is important that we make provisions to protect their family unit and their childhood as much as possible.  The emergency accommodation available for these families is neither safe nor sufficient for the huge demands that exist.  We owe a huge debt to the various charities, such as Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust, that assist the homeless community throughout the country on a daily basis.  In the current climate, tenants are finding it extremely difficult to source adequate accommodation as a result of a lack of supply and high demand.<\/p><p>According to census 2016, some 260,000 houses throughout the State are vacant.  Common sense dictates that these houses could go a long way towards solving the immediate housing crisis.  In order to achieve this, the building control and regulation process must be changed if we are to fast track the utilisation of these vacant or derelict buildings.  My constituency in Cork South-West has many of these types of buildings.  Throughout every town I travel I see these houses, some even without roofs on them, and there is no law on it; they are just left there.  If a few slates fall to the ground they get a letter and no more.  The buildings should be confiscated from people after so many years if they are not using them.<\/p> <p> There is a pattern of vacant above-the-shop units in every city, town and village.  These units could be refurbished to provide much need residential dwellings.  During the discussions on housing in the talks for the formation of Government in 2016, I raised awareness of this issue and gave the example of my home town of Schull in West Cork where very few families live over commercial premises.  This trend, which has been occurring over the past 20 years, has impacted very negatively on our towns and villages such as Ballinee, Eyeries, Goleen, Kilcrohane, Kealkill, Drimoleague, Timoleague, Durrus, Ballydehob and Schull.  I have spoken at length of a regeneration programme for these small rural towns and villages and the ability to rebuild these communities.  I proposed that we should encourage families to take up residence over shops and commercial units by offering refurbishment grants.  This would help in some small way in easing the housing pressure and it would promote the survival of our rural towns and villages.<\/p> <p> The Minister and the Government have done little to fix the current housing crisis.  On a regular basis we see new motions from all ends of the Opposition introduced as an effort to tackle the housing crisis but we have seen little action on the Minister's side of the House.

It is a very laudable idea.  There are many couples and young people struggling to pay even the rent.  Consider the town of Killarney, for example, where rents of more than &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,200 per month are now common.  Rent of &euro;2,000 per month has been asked for houses in and around Killarney.  With the incomes people have, and with families and everything else, they cannot afford these rents.  When they get a notice to quit, which many of them seem to be getting recently and especially around Killarney, Tralee and Castleisland, they are very worried that they will not find a home, that they will be out on the road or their family will finish up in one room in the homeless centres in Tralee or Killarney.  They are scared of their lives of this happening.  Many couples are very worried about this.<\/p>  <p>  This evening I want to determine the funding available for demountable homes, which I have come across in Kerry.  The information I have heard from the housing section is that it is hard to get money from the Department to fund demountable homes.  These people have an asset which is the site on which to place the demountable home.  I want to determine if the Government is giving enough money to the local authorities or if it is the case that something has happened whereby the local authority is not approving this funding.  I praise our local authority, especially the housing section and the grants section, for the great work it is doing giving grants to older people and to those who have a disability so they can stay in their homes for longer.  That is where everybody wants to stay.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Collins has said that many houses are vacant but I do not agree with my colleague that these houses should be knocked or taken away from the owners.  I believe that many of those who have a house and who cannot use it for the time being may come back when they get the opportunity.

Was it uimhir a naoi or were there six or seven Ministers?  We talk about Charlie McCreevy's dirty dozen of tax cuts, but these housing Ministers are the useless six or seven, or whatever it is.  The Government talks and talks but it will not walk the walk.  It has promised housing but every figure that the Minister, Deputy Murphy, brings out and every statistic in print that has been predicted or suggested has failed miserably.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to policy, back through the decades Fine Gael was never good at building houses.  Houses were built under Fianna F&aacute;il governments when there were no cranes or such equipment.  Fine Gael never built them because it is not interested in the small people, na daoine beaga.  It was only interested in the big landlords with daffodils up and down the drive and the twisted boreen or laneway going up.  It was \"To hell with the people\".  The policy is quite clear; the Government does not want to house people.  It tells us about all the money it gives to the councils, but the council tells us that it does not have the money.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has said that the council does not have money for demountable homes and for many other things.<\/p>  <p>  Nothing has changed.  The figures are being massaged, managed and manicured to lead people to believe the Government.  In Dublin tonight there are 30 pregnant mothers who are homeless, yet the Government wants to bring in abortion.  That would get them off the lists.  Has the Government lost its way completely?  Or maybe it has not lost its way and it is a carefully laid plan not to house these people or allow them to build houses.  They will not allow people to build houses in the country.  I know of at least 12 young couples who have the wherewithal, the money and the site but they cannot get planning permission.  Any way they go they cannot get housing.  There is some plan greater than we can crack as to why the Government will not house people or allow people to house themselves with dignity.<\/p>  <p>  It is great that we have so many people who want to get on an affordable scheme so they are not demanding a house from the State.  They want to pay, get an affordable scheme and get a loan but the Minister will not do it.  He refuses to do it in spite of all the work done by Fr. Peter McVerry and all the other organisations.  There are many organisations also in Tipperary, from Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel and from Tipperary town to Thurles and Nenagh.  Voluntary groups have delivered.  Last week I attended a launch on what the voluntary sector intends to build.  They have done this under Dr. Donal McManus and the Irish Council for Social Housing and the other agencies.  They can do it.  People can do it if the Minister would let them get planning.  The Government will not do this and it is a mockery.  There were 11 houses built in Tipperary over five or six years.  It was not even two houses per year.  It is a joke.<\/p>  <p>  It is time the Minister copped on, stepped up to the plate and came clean with the people.  He must tell people why he will not house them.  We have more than 3,100 approved applicants on the housing waiting list in Tipperary.  There are 10,000 people looking for houses.  It is the same story up and down the country but the Minister brings out this report and that report.  If reports could build houses we would have houses galore.  Consultants and everyone else get paid to compile these reports, do grand launches and turn sods, but then nothing happens.  There is something seriously wrong with the Government and the people will tell the politicians this when they go back for votes.  It is time the Government delivered something other than spoof and talk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600069#WWW00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1526500800,"counter":830,"content":"<p>The hypocrisy in the House tonight is absolutely breathtaking.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party abolished the local authority public house building programme and handed it over to the private market.  The Fine Gael Government since 2011 embraced the abolition of the public housing programme and embraced the privatisation of the housing programme.  It has made matters worse ever since.  The Labour Party representative, who spoke earlier, introduced the infamous housing assistance payment scheme, which gave hundreds of millions of euro to landlords while condemning ordinary families to an existence.  It is an existence because when a person has paid rent to the local authority and the huge top-up to the landlord, he or she does not have two cents to rub together at the end of the week.  Any little thing that might get in the way such as an illness, a communion, a confirmation or a death throws a family into poverty and into the hands of moneylenders.<\/p><p>When did we last have nearly 10,000 people homeless?  When did we have people dying on our streets?  We have that now because this Government of Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, has embraced the private market in the building of public housing.  That has created a major crisis.  It has in fact created an emergency.<br\/><br\/>I remember well when the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government abolished the local authority house building programme.  I was on South Tipperary County Council at the time and I remember responding to the circular by prophecising that this would happen, but even I did not believe that we would have 10,000 people homeless or people dying on our streets.  That is what has happened, though.  That is what putting one's faith in privatisation means, namely, ordinary families coming off the worst.  What could be worse than being homeless or dying on the street?<br\/><br\/>Of the 10,000 people homeless, 3,500 are children.  Approximately 100,000 people are on local authority housing lists, 25,000 or more are on the infamous HAP scheme, approximately 30,000 families are in serious mortgage arrears, and rents are sky rocketing to the point that they are now 25% higher than they were at the height of the boom.  Not a day goes by that a homeless person does not come to the office or ring the phone of every Deputy.  Sometimes, two or three homeless people present everyday, even in my office in Tipperary.  Not too long ago people were saying that the peak of the crisis was to be found in Dublin, but it is all over the country now.<br\/><br\/>Even our President has indicated that the policy being pursued by this and the previous Governments as well as the preceding Fianna F&aacute;il Governments is wrong.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>We have to accept once and for all that people who need housing and cannot provide from their own means should not be abandoned to the marketplace and the principle should be accepted that their housing should be as good as any other housing.... One of the most basic deprivations a human being can sufferer, or fear, is that of being homeless ...<\/blockquote><p>He also stated, &quot;It's about democracy.  You can't leave the provision of housing to a residual feature of the market place.  We have done that and homelessness is a consequence of that.&quot;<br\/><br\/>We need to do a number of things if we are to make any progress on this housing crisis.  First, we need a declaration of a housing emergency.  We all know why, that being, we are in an emergency.  It is possible to declare an emergency - it has been done before.  The previous Government did it with the FEMPI legislation.  It should be done again, and the quicker, the better.<br\/><br\/>We need a major public house building programme.  We must return to local authorities building at a significant rate of at least 10,000 houses per year, but more if possible.  We need to use moneys offered by the credit union movement to help in that regard.  We need to stop the evictions and repossessions, which are only building up the crisis and adding to local authority housing lists.  We do not need new laws or the like.  The Government simply needs to instruct the banks that we own - Allied Irish Banks and Permanent TSB - to stop their repossessions, to stop taking houses from people and families, and to leave roofs over their heads.  That would be of significant benefit to families that are suffering in these circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The rent pressure zones have not, and will not, work, so we need real rent controls.  That is one reason for a housing emergency to be declared.  Rents are now 25% higher than they were during the boom peak and families are being fleeced.  Even families in what would be regarded as good quality employment are living from hand to mouth because they have little or nothing left at the end of the week.  We need rent controls urgently.<br\/><br\/>We need to introduce legislation that would allow tenants to continue their tenancies after their private landlords sell on their houses.  Such legislation is available in other jurisdictions and is nothing new.  It has been discussed in the Chamber previously.  The law should be introduced immediately because this issue is directly contributing to homelessness.  It is the main cause of homelessness among families, as they are being required to leave their homes when their landlords sell their buy-to-let properties.<br\/><br\/>The limits placed on inclusion on local authority housing waiting lists need to be increased significantly.  They were reduced by the previous Government and now there is a large cohort of people who do not qualify to join the lists or to get mortgages.  They are paying exorbitant rents.  This situation needs to be dealt with urgently.  The new Rebuilding Ireland loan scheme has made matters worse, particularly given that a 10% deposit is required.  Previously, someone could get a 98% loan from a local authority.  Now, someone must have a 10% deposit, but can anyone explain how a family paying anything up to &euro;1,500 per month in private rented accommodation can also save for a 10% deposit?  It is not possible.  The scheme is unworkable and needs to be changed urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600069#WWW00400","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526501400,"counter":832,"content":"<p>We now move to the Fianna F&aacute;il speaking slot of ten minutes.

When one drills down into it, the principle is a basic one: people who want and are willing to provide for themselves cannot do so because their incomes do not match the cost of a house.  When people seek a mortgage to purchase the house they want to buy, they are told that their income is at such a level that any mortgage they might be given will not allow them to buy it.  In my constituency of Kildare North, a three-bedroom semi-detached house probably costs in the region of &euro;260,000 to &euro;270,000.<\/p>  <p>  An interesting statistic on which there has been no discussion is that couples or individuals who, in light of their income-to-house price ratios, have been refused mortgages because of their inability to repay them are actually paying far more in monthly rents than their mortgages would ever be.  Rents are increasing year on year or, in some cases, month on month.  People are paying &euro;1,300, &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500 per month in rent and are still being told they would be unable to repay a mortgage.<\/p><p>We must examine people's ability to pay and factor that into the consideration of house prices and mortgage approval.  If a person has been paying a high rent for two or three years, that should be factored into a consideration of his or her ability to pay in order to help them access funds to purchase a home and get onto the property ladder.  <\/p> <p> The home loan programme is not working.  The statistics pertaining to my county show that more applications are being refused than granted.  That initiative is not assisting positively in any way in getting people into their own homes.<\/p> <p> Council-owned land banks, of which there are many around the country, have been mentioned.  Land owned by councils that is zoned residential could be developed through Government borrowing at the close to 0% interest rate it can access on the European markets, which compares very favourably to the interest rates available from the private sector and commercial banks.  The development of that land, which is owned and in the trust of the State, utilising borrowing at that low interest rate could assist in making properties more affordable if it is done in an appropriate way.  That is an opportunity of which the State is not taking ownership.<\/p> <p> As was stated earlier, the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which I have discussed with the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, is far too slow.  I acknowledge that it is not geared towards delivering affordable housing but, rather, opening up land to deliver housing stock, which is also important.<\/p> <p> I listened to the Sinn F&eacute;in contribution to this debate while in my office.  I will not take any lectures from Sinn F&eacute;in about confidence and supply, supporting Government and having an input into the delivery of housing.  Two and a half years ago, Sinn F&eacute;in had the opportunity to enter Government but it ran for three months and stated that it would not consider forming a government unless it were the lead party in that government.  There was little hope of that.  I also listened to the lecture delivered by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  The best housing policy the Labour Party put in place was the creation of the housing assistance payment, HAP, which was actually a transfer list designed to reduce the housing list and make the statistics look better so that the Labour Party could pretend to the electorate that it was dealing with housing lists when it was not so doing.  We should not take any lectures on housing from those parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600070#XXX00300","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526502000,"counter":835,"content":"<p>Ordinary people can no longer afford to own their own homes.  I have spoken many times on the tenant purchase scheme.  I thank Deputy Darragh O'Brien, Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on housing, for the opportunity to do so again.  The  tenant purchase scheme was first established by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Opening a pathway to home ownership is at the heart of Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  The right to buy under the tenant purchase scheme has been an important tool in extending home ownership opportunities to low income households but the requirements to qualify for the scheme are too strict for many people on social welfare and the elderly and must be changed.<\/p>  <p>  People whose name was previously on the title of a property such as a family home, a parent's home, or a home from a previous relationship that was sold following a divorce or a bank forcing the sale and who are now in a new relationship and seek to purchase a house from a local authority are being restricted from doing so.  Although the local authority will agree to sell them a house, it will not lend them money for the purchase because such people previously had their name on another property.  They are told to get a loan from a bank.  However, when such people go to the bank, the bank will not lend to them because of the incremental purchase charge the local authority puts on the house.  That is causing much hardship.  I have discussed such a case of which I am aware with the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Elderly people who wish to purchase their house under the tenant purchase scheme but cannot show an annual income of &euro;15,000 are excluded from being allowed to do so even though many have been in their house for 30 or 40 years.  Such people may be in their 70s or 80s and retired.   Those houses will not come back into the housing stock because in many cases family members live with the elderly person and the house is transferred to the son or daughter or other person living there.  It is very unfair that those elderly people are being discriminated against because they do not have an annual earned income of at least &euro;15,000.<\/p>  <p>  I previously raised the issue of a housing development in Lucan on which 178 houses are being built.  The site is owned by NAMA, which has done a deal with the developer such that NAMA gets paid as the houses are built and sold.  I have no issue with that.  However, rather than being sold to people struggling to purchase a home for themselves, every house in the estate has been sold to a vulture fund.  People are queueing outside the finished houses to rent them for &euro;2,200 per month.  If that continues, what chance will any young couple or family have of ever purchasing a house in Dublin city?  That is the situation across the city, not just in Lucan, and should not be allowed, particularly on land owned by NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600071#YYY00200","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1526502000,"counter":836,"content":"<p>The country is facing a growing housing affordability problem to which the Government has yet to face up.  Ordinary people can no longer hope to afford to own their own home because of rising prices.  Fine Gael has an appalling record on providing affordable housing.  It scrapped the existing affordable housing scheme in 2011 and nothing has since been built.  The flagship LIHAF scheme is still not delivering.  In my area, the LIHAF in Ballincollig, which was to be the largest in County Cork with an investment of &euro;7.4 million, was to deliver 520 affordable homes.  It has now been dropped from LIHAF 1 because it was not progressing.  Across a field from it, 34 social houses planned for Old Fort Gate have not been delivered.  The Poulavone social housing scheme is still far from completion.  When one consider such situations in one corner of the constituency, it is hard to blame people in Ballincollig for feeling that the Government has not delivered and has abandoned people in terms of housing.  That is only one corner of Cork north west.  There are similar situations in many other places because affordable houses have not been built for many years.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has put forward a clear list of measures to boost overall supply and address affordability.  The Minister must facilitate home ownership by requiring lenders to take account of rent payments when deciding on mortgage approval.  People are paying high rents and it is impossible for them to put together a deposit at the same time.  A first-time buyers savings scheme is needed.  The Government must encourage residential development in town and village centres, in which there are many vacant units.  That would greatly add to the sense of community in such places.  Renters must be supported by strict policing of rent pressure zones with more enforcement powers.<\/p>  <p>  We need an end to spin and schemes and a move towards blocks and mortar and the delivery of houses that people on ordinary wages can hope to someday afford and call home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600071#YYY00300","speaker":"1284"},{"type":"speech","time":1526502000,"counter":837,"content":"<p>In the absence of any Government Deputies offering, we move back to Fianna F&aacute;il.

I will give them that.  A couple of points were raised earlier.  I heard some of the comments made by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in response to what Fianna F&aacute;il is calling for in the motion.  Very often we are accused of not addressing the housing shortage early enough and not stepping in, but as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said we took the first chance we got when the State finances were repaired and there was money and we made sure to put it back into housing.  Listening to Fianna F&aacute;il one would forget that for seven or eight years there was no money.  It was not there.  I listened to Deputy Cassells and many others speaking as if there was money and there was never a problem with housing.  We had better not forget that housing construction fell by 90%.  Hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs and left.  I will never ever forget knocking on doors in 2011 and meeting people who said this country had no future and their children had no future.  That is what they were saying.  They could not see any hope.  I do not go back to that very often in this House but we had better not forget what has happened in the past seven or eight years and prior to that.  I do not mind all the political slagging.  That is all part of it, but it comes back to housing construction.  However, we had better not forget the hurt that was in people's eyes.  I have only seen that same hurt since in the last couple of weeks over the recent scandals, but back in 2011 people were genuinely afraid that their children and grandchildren had no future in this country.  It does not work to just put down a motion about affordable housing as if one could just fix the entire housing crisis by clicking one's fingers.  One cannot just rewrite history.  It takes time to get housing construction going again.  The underlying idea behind Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing, was an investment case to secure the money that was needed to invest in housing.  We put together a business case and a plan and secured &euro;6 billion of taxpayers' money to invest.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to comments earlier about the great work being done by many NGOs such as Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, the Simon Community and many others.  There was also much praise for housing associations and the great work they do.  People also need to realise that they are also spending taxpayers' money.  They are part of Rebuilding Ireland.  They work with local authorities and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  They are all playing their part as stakeholders in the delivery of houses, housing solutions and homeless services, but that is being done with taxpayers' money.  This year we will spend the guts of &euro;2 billion of taxpayers' money and the taxpayers need to know that their money is funding solutions.  When Members of this House constantly say what the Government is not doing and praising everybody else they should realise it is taxpayers' money being channelled through a Department by the Government.  In some cases it is matched with voluntary help and fundraising but a lot of taxpayers' money is funding those solutions too.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's approach is working and it is providing solutions.  The fact that we are in here discussing a motion on affordable housing shows that our plan is now working because stage 1 of the plan was to address homelessness and social housing, and to restart social housing which had been stopped well before any recession.  Let us not kid ourselves.  Many local authorities did not have housing teams for many years before the recession because they did not need them.  The first step was to go back into local authorities, put the teams together, channel the taxpayers' money through local authorities and put them in a prime position to deliver housing.  They are now doing that.  Last year we saw an additional 7,000 houses coming into the system through a combination of direct build, acquisition, Part V, long-term leasing and other schemes as well.  In addition, another 17,000 to 18,000 houses were provided through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and other schemes as well.  In total, 26,000 families had housing solutions.  A total of 4,700 people left the homeless situation.<\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, we admit that there are still between 9,500 and 10,000 people in a homeless situation for various reasons.  Everyone has their own individual story.  We met many people today who were in a hotel for three or four months last year in the Fingal area and now they are in a house.  I made the point that the story is changing for many of them.  When we first started to tackle the situation people were living for two or three years in emergency accommodation in a hotel or bed and breakfast.  Thankfully, there has been a lot of movement in that regard.  I accept that there are still far too many people in emergency accommodation, bed and breakfasts and hotels but the story is a little bit different.  People are not there for as long as they used to be.  They are moving through the system.  They recognise that.  They do not want to be there.  We do not want them there - nobody does.  It is not a place to be or to raise a family.  Thankfully, with taxpayers' money being spent in the right way, through a plan, this year we will see more than 8,000 new social houses coming into the system.  Many of the people who are in emergency accommodation tonight, who are homeless or without a house or in an overcrowded situation with their family will be in a home during this year.<\/p>  <p>  Many others will avail of the HAP scheme and other schemes and housing solutions that are being provided.  Deputy Frank O'Rourke suggested that in some cases the scheme is not working the way it should be.  We accept that and we will address it and move things on.  I heard some speakers criticise the HAP scheme.  I remind them that before the HAP scheme there was rent assistance which prevented people from increasing their income.  That discouraged people from going back to work.  If one got a job one was penalised and lost the assistance straight away.  The HAP scheme was brought in to encourage people to get back into work when they could and to take up a job, and to better provide for themselves and their families.  It did not hold them back.  That is what it was there for, but it also meant that more than 30,000 people are in a home today of their choosing - one they found that suits their needs that is subsidised through the State.  They will adjust their needs as they go along and many of those people will choose to leave and go on to either their own private house or into a permanent social house.  HAP is not a scheme to put people to one side because more than 1,000 people have left it and moved into a permanent social house.  It is part of a journey that people are on.<\/p>  <p>  We do not want to rely on the private sector all the time for social housing solutions but in the short term when we are rebuilding the construction housing sector we will have to rely on the private sector to some extent or make it a partner until the State is in a position that the housing stock is replenished and it can continue on by itself.  That is what the approach is about.  There is a commitment from the Government with the support of many others as well to deliver a minimum of 50,000 social houses in the next three or four years.  People ask why the houses are not there.  Anyone with common sense knows one cannot do it in six months or a year.  We are approximately 19 or 20 months into our programme.  The Department has been totally reorganised and we have different teams and schemes working through local authorities which have changed their processes.  A lot of change has happened which will deliver all those thousands of houses this year, next year and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Part of the remit of Rebuilding Ireland was to put in place a sustainable residential housing construction sector to give people confidence that it is a safe place to invest in their skills, be it in formal education and training, an apprenticeship or traineeship or at fourth level.  We are encouraging people to go back into those areas to retrain, add to their skills and as the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said earlier to restart their companies and put them together again, to invest in this sector and plan for the future.  That is what this document was about, namely, putting people in a position that they could have confidence to invest again in a housing construction sector.  There was a guarantee to deliver 25,000 to 30,000 houses every year for the next five, ten and 20 years to match proper planning.  That is what it is doing.  This year the supply of housing will increase by more than 20,000.  The industry itself says 23,000 and the Central Bank says the same.  The Department conservatively estimates the total will be approximately 21,000.  That is ahead of our own target.  Next year we will build on that.  Each and every year the supply of housing increases, which will deliver social housing, affordable housing, housing for the rental sector and across all the different areas, and private housing at the right price as well.  The supply of housing is the solution to all of the problems.  That is what is being achieved by Government intervention through the Action Plan for Housing devised by the Department.  That is what it is there for.  It does not mean one can fix the problems in one night, one weekend, six months or one year.  We cannot do that.  It is a five-year plan to deal with all the housing-related problems and it is delivering because we can see the social housing.<\/p>  <p>  Going back to the people who are homeless, we wish they were not in emergency accommodation.  It is not a place to be.  All our efforts are to make sure they are not there but there has been progress.  In terms of people's individual stories for being there, two or three years ago it was nearly always based on economic need but that is not the story any more.  There are different stories but it is not just due to economic and financial reasons.  There is movement and we are addressing all the various scenarios.  We are working with individuals and families to get them back into a home or get them back on track if they have other needs as well.  Progress is being made.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the comment that funding for other services around housing has to match.  Deputy Cassells has a bit of a cheek to come in here and say the Government has to build houses and then provide all the services around them as well.  We watched construction in this country go to 90,000 houses per year without the services around them.  All the counties surrounding Dublin and in the greater Dublin region were let down by Governments that allowed house after house to be built without the proper services and infrastructure.  Rebuilding Ireland, which was launched by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is a long-term plan which includes the services around the houses.  It plans where we are going to put the houses in the future and where there will be schools, shops, education facilities and health services around them.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>A site in Ashbourne that is big enough to provide educational facilities - which is what is was purchased for in the first instance, as well as housing and some community amenities - was chosen.  It is not all just for houses.  Let us not kid ourselves.  That is not what the council brought forward in its plan.  Ashbourne exploded because of a lack of planning.  It is full of houses, like everywhere else in the greater Dublin area.  There is no longer a lack of planning.  The plan is in place and we will deliver services with houses.<\/p> <p> I was in Balrothery, which is in Deputy Darragh O'Brien's constituency, earlier today opening new houses.  Residents told me that two years ago they opposed the building of those nine houses because they thought that a playground should be built on the site.  They told me they were wrong to oppose the development and that they are happy the houses have been built.  I want to be clear on this - they said they were wrong.  Likewise, when the position is explained to residents in Ashbourne, they may also realise that they are wrong to object.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600072#ZZZ00800","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526503200,"counter":848,"content":"<p>We will proceed to the final contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600073#AAAA00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1526503200,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I will make one final point.

I know that he cannot fix this overnight or in six months.  I know that he cannot flick a switch and solve the problem.  However, this problem has been ongoing for five years.  In 2014, the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, launched the plan that was going to solve the housing problem by 2021.  It is now 2018 and we are only getting a trickle of houses coming onto the market.  The Minister of State said that the Government's social housing plan is working, but there are 10,000 homeless people in the country as we speak.  Is the Minister of State delusional about what is working?  Does he think that we, as Opposition Deputies, are making this stuff up?  Does he think we would be saying that there is an affordable housing crisis and trying to put forward solutions through our party spokesman, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, if there was no issue out there?  It is time to realise that there is a problem.  The Minister of State telling us that there is no problem and pretending that it is going to go away will not solve it.<\/p>  <p>  I worked in construction for 15 years.  I worked as an engineer and I know what it takes to get planning permission up and running, to get a site serviced and to get houses built.  I know that 12 to 18 months would be long enough if one had the determination and the drive.  There is an affordable housing issue out there.  There are many couples on good salaries who simply cannot afford to enter the housing market.  We are putting forward viable proposals and asking the Government to work with us to solve a problem.

There are 10,000 homeless people in the country.  I know that these figures have been bandied about all evening, but they represent the reality.  Unfortunately, over 3,500 of those who are homeless are children.  As the Minister and Minister of State know from their constituency clinics, many of the people who find themselves homeless or about to lose their homes are ordinary individuals with decent jobs - teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; - who are facing repossession.  There are no social housing building programmes under way in rural constituencies such as Cavan and Monaghan.  With over 100,000 on waiting lists, this is a national crisis.  In Cavan and Monaghan, those in need of social housing are facing waiting lists of three to five years.  I know that the situation in places like County Meath is a lot worse.  What does one say to people who come into one's clinic who are about to have their homes repossessed, their keys taken off them, with no homes to go to?  They are facing the prospect of either being homeless or sleeping on the couch in their parents houses.  There are houses now with three generations of the same family living in them.  People are losing their homes through repossession day after day and the housing crisis deepens.  We are urging the Government to launch a new State-led affordable housing scheme.  This must involve an initial capital investment on the part of the State, with the proceeds of sales reinvested into the building of more homes.  It is essential that the Government earmarks additional capital investment for such a scheme to facilitate house building in key areas across the country.  The Government must assist local authorities in reviewing their housing team needs.  As the Minister of State said, the housing teams in a lot of local authorities were no longer there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600073#AAAA00600","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1526503200,"counter":853,"content":"<p>They are there now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600073#AAAA00700","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1526503200,"counter":854,"content":"<p>We need to give local authorities the capacity to deal with this and get housing schemes under way.

I tabled that question because I was dealing with three such cases in my constituency.  I thought that if I was dealing with cases, then every other Deputy must have a similar number.  There are 6,035 adults accessing these services and 120 of them are elderly.  This is disgraceful.  While it may be small compared the overall number of homeless people, it signifies a failure on the part of the State to provide housing to a highly vulnerable cohort of our citizens.  Older people can often find themselves in very vulnerable situations in the context of their health and personal finances and the fact that some are trying to deal with homeless issues at this stage of their lives is disgraceful.  I would have thought that much earlier in this housing crisis older people would be specifically targeted.  The additional needs of elderly people who are homeless must be addressed.  I ask the Government to prioritise these 120 people.  They are in a very vulnerable situation, with nowhere to live.  Many of them have worked all of their lives and have fallen on hard times.

I have given the facts.  The last time we were in government, an average of 3,645 social houses were built each year.  That contrasts with the position during the Minister's tenure.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has said we cannot fix this overnight.  I would have thought that five years would have been enough.  We should have seen some progress after three years.  There are 508 units being built each year, in effect.  Over 16,700 houses were delivered under the affordable homes scheme that was previously in place.  There is no doubt that there were imperfections with that scheme.  We are looking to engage to create a scheme that will work.  That is what we will do prior to the budget.  We will put forward our proposals.  It is up to the Government to decide whether to accept them.  As I said earlier, the purpose of this motion is to lay down a marker that this is the beginning.  We want to see a housing budget.  We will assist and we will be constructive.  We will work with everyone, but we will not be silent when we believe the wrong track and the wrong approach are being taken.
