Tonight's vote in Westminster is the latest instalment in a lengthening saga in which no coherent, concrete view on Brexit commanding a majority of British parliamentarians is emerging.  The withdrawal treaty looks set to be defeated - although we do not know that for certain - plunging all of us into greater uncertainty and speculation in the days ahead.  We cannot influence tonight's vote, if we are honest, but we can influence how prepared we are for any eventuality that may emerge, including, of course, a no-deal Brexit, by the end of March.  It is my view that the Government has treated the D&aacute;il and the public shabbily and badly when it has come to sharing its plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The Government should treat the Oireachtas and the public with greater respect in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Under pressure, the Government published a contingency plan on 19 December, the day on which the D&aacute;il went into recess prior to Christmas.  The document itself is light, lacking in detail and needs considerable fleshing out.  It outlines up to 22 elements of primary legislation and more than 20 areas of secondary legislation that may be required.  I hardly need to point out that there are only 25 sitting days in this House between now and 29 March, when all this legislation, in addition to other legislation, will be required to be passed if we end up with a no-deal Brexit scenario.  We do not know much because the heads or outlines of the legislation have not even been published or circulated to Members of the Oireachtas.  The contingency plan published in late December deals rather sketchily with a number of important areas such as medicine supplies, aviation, the land bridge, ports and airports, staffing, Revenue and agriculture.  I have some specific questions for the Taoiseach on these areas.  Do any of the changes required at our ports and airports as a consequence of Brexit require planning permission or legislative changes?  If so, has planning permission, where necessary, been sought?<\/p><p>Is all relevant ICT infrastructure in place at our ports and airports, or will it be in place by 29 March in the event of a no-deal Brexit?<\/p> <p> Approximately 240 medicines are listed as being in short supply, which is more than normal.  Deputy Brassil has been diligent in bringing this information to me.  Anecdotally, we have heard of the difficulty that all pharmacists are having with such a short supply of drugs.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government is stockpiling key medicines, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index which are not interchangeable in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  Will he outline the medicine supply situation and how the Government intends to deal with the legislation that would be required in the event of a no-deal Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547561100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy back and wish him and his party a happy new year.<\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal agreement is the only agreement on the table, and it has been supported by 28 Governments, including that of the United Kingdom.  We will allow the democratic process to take its course in Westminster tonight, when the British Parliament will vote on the withdrawal agreement and four amendments.  We will review the position tomorrow in consultation with our EU colleagues.  At Cabinet earlier, we discussed preparation for a no-deal.  I still believe a no-deal is unlikely but we must be prepared for it, or at least as prepared as any country can be.  We discussed four memos which related to the common travel area, medicine supply, transport and, perhaps most important, the legislation that will be required.  We are happy to share that legislation with the Opposition, and the T&aacute;naiste has been in touch with spokespeople to organise briefings with the Opposition this afternoon.  After we have briefed the Opposition, we will brief the media.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's questions on the ports and the airports, planning permission will not be required in most cases.  What will be required, however, are parking areas and parking bays, and a certain amount of accommodation for staff.  Where planning permission is needed, the Minister for Finance can use his powers to make directions to the Office of Public Works.  <\/p>  <p>  On medicines, a plan has been put in place and a working group, comprising representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Food Safety Authority, has met every week for nearly two years.  It has advised against stockpiling because it believes stockpiling may cause a break in supply, although it is working closely with the pharmaceutical industry and the main wholesalers to ensure an adequate supply.  It has identified a watch-list of approximately 24 medicines about which we are most concerned.  As the Deputy will know, between approximately 60% and 70% of medicines transit the UK or come from the UK.  The watch-list has been developed, and those 24 medicines are the ones to which we must pay particular attention.<\/p>  <p>  On legislation, we agreed we would put all the necessary legislation relating to Brexit into one large, omnibus Brexit Bill, with 17 different parts to it, that is, effectively 17 pieces of legislation in one, covering a number of different areas which I can outline in my follow-up reply.  We are keen to consult and seek co-operation and engagement from the Opposition on getting this legislation through.  We published our legislative programme earlier.  Most of the time when a legislative programme is produced, there will be 20, 30 or 40 Bills, but there are only six on the priority list for this session in order that we can ensure we give all the time to the legislation that is needed in the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1547561100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and wish him a happy new year.

Members of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, are also due to commence industrial action with a three-day stoppage due to take place from 12 to 14 of February.  We all know that strike action is the last thing nurses and midwives and medical professionals for that matter want to undertake.  These people believe they have been left with no choice but to undertake such action given the ignorance, arrogance and the ineptitude of the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues in relation to dealing with the crisis we face.  The Government has had years to address the recruitment and retention crisis in our hospitals and we see how it is crippling our health service but it has completely failed.  The situation has deteriorated year-on-year and month-on-month.  Nurses, midwives and their unions have continuously sought engagement with the Minister for Health as well as with the Minister for Finance to address the question of staff shortages and pay to avert the industrial action we face.  Their concerns have been routinely ignored by this Government.  In fact, what has happened is that they have been verbally attacked, threatened and insulted as they have tried to achieve a resolution to a crisis and it is impacting on so many of our patients.<\/p>  <p>  It is the staff of our hospitals who have acted with responsibility and in a mature manner.  The Taoiseach and his Government have decided to disengage.  Nurses and midwives deserve our full support.  In terms of their demand for a better health service that treats them as essential, skilled workers and with dignity and value, I and my party fully support them.  The Taoiseach's approach has been to dismiss these concerns and industrial action is now the regrettable outworking of his Government's policy and that of his Minister as he ignores the issue of the recruitment and retention crisis in our hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  For years nurses, midwives and their unions have put forward sensible proposals to try to address this issue.  Last April we in Sinn F&eacute;in passed a motion in this House calling for the introduction of recruitment and retention measures based on realistic proposals which would prioritise pay.  It was supported by the majority of Deputies in this House.  This motion called for Government to work with unions to draw up a roadmap for full pay equality with an implementation plan to deliver pay equality within a short timeframe, not the eight year timeframe the Taoiseach has offered.<\/p><p>At the 11th hour, will the Taoiseach concede that he has failed to tackle the recruitment and retention crisis in the health service?

They are not unique to Ireland: the same problems exist in places where pay is much lower, such as Northern Ireland, and much higher, namely, the Middle East and Australia.  It is the consequence of an international labour market in which there is a shortage of healthcare staff.  Deputy Pearse Doherty should not give anyone the false impression that what is happening means we are not making progress.  The number of nurses employed in the public health service in the past five years increased by 2,330.  If one compares the position year on year &ndash; it is important to compare month with month for seasonal reasons &ndash; the number of nurses working in the health service in November 2018 was 860 more than in November 2017.  That is an increase of 860 in a year and it does not include student nurses.  Those are the facts.  People could be given the impression that there are more nurses leaving the profession and leaving the country than there are nurses going into the profession and coming into the country but that is not the case.  There are 3,000 more nurses working in the public health service than was the case five years ago, and recruitment will continue.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that two of the three nursing unions have voted for strike action.  The ballots were very decisive, with 95% voting for strike action.  That reflects the depth of feeling among nurses and midwives regarding their pay and conditions.  The Government does not believe for a second that nurses are anything other than sincere in the action they are proposing to take.  We will do our best to try to avoid a strike.  An engagement involving employers and unions is taking place today.  A meeting of the oversight committee for the public sector pay deal, at which the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health will be represented, will take place on Friday next.  There are other avenues, including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  We will do everything we reasonably can to prevent this strike from happening but we need to bear in mind that there is already a pay deal in place.  That deal, which was agreed not just with nurses and midwives but with all public servants, runs until 2020.  It would not be fair or affordable to offer a special deal to one group in the public service and then say to every other group that we have no money left for them.  That would not be right.  That is the reason we have collective agreements with ICTU and I am of the view that it is the right way to manage public sector pay.<\/p>  <p>  We should not forget what is involved in the agreement to which I refer.  This year alone, there are five different ways in which public servants' pay can increase: there will be an across the board pay increase in the autumn; a special pay increase for those earning under &euro;30,000 has just kicked in this month; there has been a reduction in the pension levy; a special increase for new entrants in March, should that be agreed;, and an incremental pay increase for most public servants over the course of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500006#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1547562000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The recruitment and retention crisis is very real.

On 29 March last year, the Taoiseach stated the housing and homelessness crisis was a national emergency yet the main causes of this emergency are the housing policies of his Government.  The results are devastating.  The public housing list has a consistent waiting list of more than 100,000, year on year.  Thousands of householders are struggling with mortgage debt.  More homeless people are sleeping and dying on our streets and many families in the private rented sector have been evicted as landlords and vulture funds seek to extract higher rents.  Ten thousand people are officially homeless, over 3,000 of whom are children, and thousands are unofficially homeless and living in overcrowded homes.<\/p>  <p>  Every week my constituency office is in contact with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, representing tenants whose landlords are attempting to illegally evict.  I was contacted by a woman last week who will be 60 this year and who lives with her partner.  She gets up early every morning and heads to work in the Alzheimer's centre on a 39-hour week.  She was renting for 14 years but she and her partner have been homeless since October and are temporarily staying with a relative because the landlord sold the house they were renting.  They searched for alternative rented accommodation but could not afford the rents.  In her dilemma, she then reduced her working hours from 39 to 28 to bring the household income below the &euro;36,000 threshold and she has applied to Dublin City Council to go on the housing waiting list, although she will be at the end of a long queue.  Can the Taoiseach imagine being in that situation?  What can he offer this woman for the future under Rebuilding Ireland?<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency two recent planning applications have been submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the strategic housing development strategy to build apartments, although these apartments will be exclusively for rent and for student accommodation and will not be for sale.  The question is who will be able to afford the rents and, in addition, there is no security of tenure.  Most likely, the supply of more than 300 apartments to rent will feed into more HAP tenancies and line the pockets of developers.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is set to spend over &euro;3 billion on rent subsidies over the next five years.  There is an alternative, which is the cost rental model or, as it is more popularly called, the secure, fair rent homes model.  This is a public housing strategy that is accessible to everyone who needs a home and to people of all income levels.  The rent would be affordable because it would be subsidised and based on the cost of provision, rather than on the market price for accommodation.  Fair rent homes are based on a proven European housing programme - the cost rental model.  This successful model exists in a number of countries.  In Austria alone, approximately 20% of people avail of cost rental housing.<\/p>  <p>  A new housing organisation would need to be established.  This organisation could service and manage the finance and oversee the implementation of a fair rent homes programme.  It could work with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the city and county councils to build and develop the fair rent homes model on a national scale.  There could be a target to build 70,000 homes in the next five years on this basis.  Why is the Taoiseach not investigating this strategy and why is the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government not coming forward to drive a strategy of this nature?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500007#E00800","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1547563200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I do not doubt for a second the depth of the housing crisis affecting so many of our citizens, whether they are in emergency accommodation at hotels or bed and breakfasts, spending a large proportion of their take-home pay on rent or seeking to buy for the first time by putting together a deposit and finding a home they can afford.  We are hard at work as a Government to deal with this.  What I can offer the citizen the Deputy mentioned is, first, more supply of housing and apartments, which is fundamental to solving this crisis.  We do not know the numbers yet for last year but we suspect that between 19,000 and 20,000 new houses and apartments were built, which is the largest number for a decade.  While it is not enough, it is going in the right direction and more than in any other year this decade.  Of those, more than 4,500 were public housing units built by local authorities or affordable housing bodies.  When was the last time approximately 25% of new housing built in Ireland was public housing?  It has not happened for a very long time.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the cost rental model.  It has a great deal of merit.  As a Government, we have seen how it has worked in other places to provide affordable accommodation, in particular in cities.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has seen it working in Vienna.  It is being pursued, including in the Deputy's own constituency at the Emmet Road development which she has supported.  It contains a significant proportion of cost-rental housing.

It is not based on the current profit-driven model for which the Taoiseach stands.  Fair rent homes are an alternative to the current private rental market and mortgage debt model and offer public rental housing for those with different income levels.  The fair rent home is crash-proof and poses a secure rental alternative to debt-based housing provision.  It provides stability in the rental sector of the sort that works in other countries.  The fair rent home offers security of tenure and lifetime affordable housing, which means people can plan their futures without worrying constantly about increasing rents and the threat of eviction and homelessness, as faced by the woman to whom I referred earlier.

I tried my best to answer her question earlier.  The Minister, Deputy Eogahn Murphy, has been to Vienna and knows it well.  That is one of the reasons he has been driving forward the cost rental model as part of the solution to our housing shortage.  To resolve the housing crisis, we need houses of all sorts.  We need houses built by developers for young people to buy or for people to upgrade to who want larger homes.  We need houses that might be bought by landlords to rent to people who need to rent for one reason or another.  We need social housing built by public bodies.  As I said to the Deputy, more than 4,000 public homes were built last year by local authorities and affordable housing bodies.  Along with leasing, direct purchase and developers, almost 8,000 homes were added to our social housing stock last year.  When is the last time that was done?  The solution must be housing of all forms because people need housing of all different times.  Cost rental is absolutely part of that picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500008#F00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1547563200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Over the weekend, we learned that PwC had been appointed to carry out an independent review of the colossal scale of spiralling costs of the national children's hospital.<\/p><p>The current estimate of the cost - it appears to increase day by day - stands at more than &euro;1.73 billion, which is almost three times more than the initial estimate of &euro;650 million.  The timescale for the project is also going to be longer than that originally envisaged.  While this crisis is unfolding on the watch of the Minister, Deputy Harris, the Taoiseach was Minister for Health when the relevant decisions were taken and when the initial information was placed in the public domain.  It appears that said information had little grounding in reality.  The origins of this spending extravaganza, which has not appeared suddenly in recent months, can be found in the establishment of this process, including that part relating to site selection.  The Taoiseach was a key player in the process during his time as Minister for Health.  There was a considerable delay prior to the awarding of the contracts.  At the time, there was a great deal of speculation that the delay was caused by difficulties getting funding in place.<\/p> <p> Did the figures ever really stack up?  Did officials ever raise this issue with the Taoiseach at that time?  Will he outline the extent to which he, as the then Minister for Health, scrutinised the tendering process?  What set of circumstances led him to sign off on contracts that now seem to have been a work of fiction?  Was the veracity of the cost projections and the timescales rigorously tested by the then Minister and his officials?  If it was, how have we ended up in this predicament?  We all know that the health budget is finite.  The cost overrun has already had an impact on health services and will continue to have such an impact.  What assurances do we have now that there will be no further increase in the estimated cost of building this hospital?<\/p> <p> We accept that the new children's hospital is desperately needed.  Fine Gael likes to laud itself as a party of prudent fiscal management - the Taoiseach did so earlier - but in the case of this project, it appears that a blank cheque has been written for those who have been awarded the contract to develop the site.  There is absolutely nothing prudent about that.  Did the Taoiseach, as the Minister for Health of the day, and his officials engage in due diligence to rigorously test the veracity of the contract proposals, specifically in relation to cost?  What immediate steps are being taken, or have been taken, to stop the overruns I have mentioned?  What is the updated figure, as of today, in relation to the cost?

We know from the programme for Government that there was an extended vaccination for meningitis B for children born after October 2016.  for children born before that date, however, parents have to pay for vaccination privately at a cost of between &euro;300 and &euro;450.  It is a major concern that many families simply do not have the money to protect their children.  Many families have one child who is protected because he or she was born after October 2016 and other children who are not.  Those families are seriously concerned.  The president of the National Association of General Practitioners, Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail, has stated that the fact that only children who were born before October 2016 and whose parents can afford the cost are being vaccinated amounts to medical apartheid.  He also stated this leads to significant parental stress and anxiety.  Will the Minister do what thousands of parents and GPs right across the State are calling on him to do?  GPs are being inundated in their clinics and have to break the news that, regardless of whether one has a medical card, one cannot get this vaccine for one's child if he or she was born before October 2016 without paying for the privilege.  Will the Minister ensure that there is a catch-up programme for all children under the age of 18 in order that we might protect children from meningitis B and ensure that it is eradicated by having the necessary level of vaccination within the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500014#M00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1547566800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

The Act is bespoke legislation which gave a new legal basis to the commission&rsquo;s investigations.  Deputies will also recall that arising from issues raised by the commission, its terms of reference were also amended by the Oireachtas in 2016 following consultations with the Opposition parties.<\/p><p>Following requests from the commission and further consultations with Opposition parties, the timeframe for the commission&rsquo;s report has been extended on several occasions.  On 23 November 2018, the commission submitted its fifth interim report to me and requested a further extension of its deadline for reporting until the end of March 2020.  I consulted with Opposition representatives on this request and there was a shared strong concern about the level of progress achieved by the commission to date, the timeframe now proposed for concluding the first module of the commission&rsquo;s work and the risks of further delays and cost escalations.  It was agreed to request a further interim report from the commission under section 33 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  This report should include any interim findings or conclusions which the commission is in a position to make at this stage; any options which the commission believes would reduce the timeframe and-or cost for production of a final report on the first module of the investigation; the commission&rsquo;s view of risks to completion of the first module of the investigation within the requested new timeframe, that is, the end of March 2020; and the commission&rsquo;s best estimate of the likely final costs of the first module.  I also extended the commission&rsquo;s timeframe until the end of March 2019.

A date for the next meeting has not yet been scheduled.  In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and Cabinet committees, I often meet with Ministers and their teams on an individual basis to focus on particular issues.  In this regard, I regularly meet with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to discuss issues relating to our health service. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to improve access to health and social services for the people through investment across community and hospital services is reflected in the significant increases in health investment in recent years.  This year will see the highest ever level of health funding in the history of the State.  We have also committed almost &euro;11 billion in capital investment over the next ten years through the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040, which is approximately double what was invested in infrastructure in healthcare in the past ten years.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published national service plan sets out in detail the level of health services to be provided by the HSE within the available funding for the coming year.  It outlines the provision of a range of Government initiatives including mental health enhancements, disability services, cervical screening, the HPV vaccine for boys, the introduction of termination of pregnancy services and the merger of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals in Dublin into Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, which took effect on 1 January.  Primary care enhancements include provision for funding for a new general practitioner, GP, contract should negotiations on it be successful, reduced prescription charges, reduced drug payment scheme charges from March, an increase in the GP visit card thresholds from March and the initiation of a programme of care redesign in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>  <p>  The service plan emphasises the importance of strengthening clinical leadership, improving patient and service user engagement and advancing a culture of patient safety, continuous quality improvement and learning.  To ensure meaningful and sustained improvement in the health service over the coming years, however, we also need to develop a major programme of reform.  The new Sl&aacute;intecare programme office has prepared a detailed action plan for 2019 as committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and I expect it to be published shortly.  A Sl&aacute;intecare advisory council has also been established under the chairmanship of Dr. Tom Keane.  These new structures will drive implementation of the reform programme. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 provides for more than &euro;200 million directly to assist a range of initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report and committed to in the implementation strategy.  Work is also under way to establish a new HSE board to strengthen the management, governance and accountability of the HSE.  Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane has been nominated as chairperson-designate of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500018#Q00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1547569200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>It is extraordinary to listen to the Taoiseach's answer on the health service: one would think everything is improving.  We are facing industrial action by thousands of nurses from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland.  Incredibly, the Taoiseach's Cabinet committee on health has not met since November despite facing industrial action by the nurses.  When he comments on the matter, he seems intent on criticising the nurses for taking industrial action.  He fails to recognise, however, that Government policy has produced this crisis and forced nurses into a position where they feel they must take industrial action.  He continues to peddle the myth that there is no retention problem for nurses, but the truth needs to be said.  For every four nursing vacancies, there is only one application.  Some 5% fewer nurses work in the health service than did in 2008, while the number of managers has increased by 40%.<\/p>  <p>  Nurses are earning &euro;7,000 less at every point of their career than similar graduate professionals working in the health service.  The Taoiseach touts pay increases which are actually restoration of cuts that his party proposed and that remain not fully restored ten years after the austerity assault on public sector workers, including nurses, was launched.  He does not acknowledge that nurses give up an hour and a half for free to the health service, or the costs resulting from overcrowding, waiting lists and cancelled operations because there are not enough nurses to staff the hospitals.  Rather, there are myths about the cost of what nurses are demanding, despite &euro;2 million a week being paid to agency nurses and overseas recruitment firms being paid &euro;10,000 per nurse recruited because the Government will not directly employ staff nurses.  All the costs of cancellations in the health service result from chronic staff shortages which in turn result from our failure to recruit enough nurses or retain them because the Government will not pay them properly.  Will the Taoiseach face up to the reality of what is going on, talk to nurses, listen to them and concede to their just and legitimate demands?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500018#Q01000","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1547569200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I return to the issue of the overrun on the cost of the national children's hospital, which the Taoiseach answered in general terms earlier.  He said he thinks the current estimate, that is, on 15 January, is the same as it was before Christmas, but in the past number of weeks there has been further speculation that it has risen from the staggering &euro;1.4 billion, which he indicated to the House before Christmas, to &euro;1.7 billion, although even that might not be the height of the cost.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach talked about the 15 operating theatres and all the rest of it.  We know what this really good hospital will comprise.  In my political career I have never seen a project so completely out of control in terms of cost.  Even the expanded cost, which was originally &euro;450 million but more realistically &euro;650 million, is now likely to be three times that figure.  How can that be?  How did that come about?  What are the factors?  The Taoiseach indicated earlier that it was an issue of construction inflation.  Construction inflation does not triple the price, otherwise every single project under construction right now would be triple the price of the estimate, which is not the case.  What are the specific reasons?  Why was this not drawn to people's attention before the end of last year in a very public fashion?<\/p> <p> Finally, the Taoiseach indicated that &euro;100 million of cuts would be required across the public sector capital programme this year and that &euro;50 million of this would be in health.  He more or less said it would just delay projects.  People are urgently waiting for dialysis units to be constructed as well as facilities in hospitals up and down the country.  Delays are really having an impact.  Many school projects will be affected as a result of the &euro;50 million to be found elsewhere.  Some &euro;100 million is a really significant sum of money.  Can the Taoiseach indicate exactly where that &euro;100 million will be found and give the House a real explanation as to how this particular project has completely gone off the rails in terms of cost oversight?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500018#Q01100","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547569800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>In the same vein, the response of the Taoiseach earlier that this will be the best hospital and will last for 100 years is fine and great.  We need the hospital and nobody objects to that but the issue here is the runaway cost.  He described this project back in 2014-2015 as spectacular, and it will be spectacular when constructed.  He said it would cost &euro;650 million and would be fully operational this year.  It will cost three times that and will not be fully operational for many years to come.<\/p>  <p>  There are serious questions and we deserve answers as to how the Government got this so wrong.  The Taoiseach will criticise others and will throw cheap shots but he was the Minister for Health.  His colleague is the Minister for Health and he is the Taoiseach who told us that he was going to take a special role and interest in this.  Every euro in terms of additional cost that will go into building this hospital will be taken from other public services, whether a school that will not be built, a community hospital that will be delayed or an extension to an existing hospital that will be delayed or put on the long finger.  These are the concerns people have about this.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach tries to dismiss this as if everything is okay but this is a throwback to the Fianna F&aacute;il era of calculations on the back of the brown envelope.  If one closed one's eyes, one could pretend one was not talking about the national children's hospital but about the Dublin Port tunnel or one of the other capital projects Fianna F&aacute;il continued to allow developers to benefit from in this State.  The Taoiseach told us that would not happen with his Government and we expected it would not.  Now that it has happened, he expects us just to ignore the fact these costs have increased to such a degree and expects us not to look for accountability.<\/p>  <p>  There are serious questions in different communities.  For example, in the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar, there are serious concerns that the MRI scanner that was part of Project Ireland 2040 will not be delivered as a result of the overruns in health.  Are these the types of capital projects that will be cut or delayed?  There is a responsibility on the Taoiseach, who has made such a cock-up of this over the past number of years, to explain to the public where the axe will fall?  Which projects will be cut because his Government and his Ministers took their eye off the ball and did not ensure value for money on this project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500019#R00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1547569800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I was very upset, like many people, when I read that parents who have not completed meningitis vaccinations for their children will not be afforded a free vaccination but instead will be charged &euro;200.  For instance, if they have three children, which many parents have, who have not completed the vaccination cycle, this will amount to &euro;600.  That would wipe out many families on social welfare or on a minimum wage income.  At the same time the Minister for Health announced a Department of Health variation of the strategic communications unit, that is, a public relations exercise fee of &euro;75,000.  Has the Taoiseach, his Minister or his Government any sense of how to address priorities in the Department of Health?

The Taoiseach was in that seat at a very important time for that project.  I was delighted to see the Taoiseach visiting Africa last week but if anybody from Europe went to a small or a large African country and was told by aid officials that a children's health project - for example, building a large children's hospital - was potentially running &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion over the estimate in the plan would immediately suspect that such a cost overrun was due to misappropriation or some form of corruption of the process.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is here to provide the D&aacute;il with answers as Leader of the Government.

The Taoiseach said earlier that when he was Minister for Health he thought it would cost &euro;650 million.  Yet in a couple of years, it has gone up to apparently to &euro;1.7 billion, according to a Cabinet memorandum that was evidently given to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  This was given days after the Taoiseach told me it was &euro;1.4 billion.  It seems the D&aacute;il is the last place to be told anything in detail.  I asked the Taoiseach in the last session of the Dail whether that the upper limit and, to be fair, he did not say it was but he did not use the figure of &euro;1.7 billion, which is in the memorandum.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>got this memorandum from somebody, and it must have been someone in government, and it published it and a lot of material on this.  To go from &euro;650 million to &euro;1.7 billion in approximately two years demands detailed explanation.  We all know the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform keeps a tight rein on capital projects and it is meant to do so and there are procedures and mechanisms for that.  It is not enough to say that a hospital group has been given <i>carte blanche<\/i>to do and spend anything it likes.  That is not the way it works and I hope that was not what was being suggested earlier today in the answer to a substantive question asked by another Deputy during Leaders' Questions.  There needs to be an Oireachtas inquiry of some sort and there should be full accountability as to how it has jumped from &euro;650 million to &euro;1.7 billion.<\/p><p>On the issue of the meningitis B vaccine, I am perturbed as to how that is being introduced.  I happened to be the Minister for Health when the meningitis C vaccine became available and we did a full programme that cost &euro;50 million at the time, most of which was a once-off cost because it was dealing with all children.  There was no hesitation about that at the time given the expert advice.  The Department of Finance accepted at the time that it had to be done on public health grounds.<\/p><p>The meningitis B vaccine was not ready at the time and the advice was that the impact of meningitis B could be potentially worse than meningitis C.  There needs to be a very serious review of how the meningitis B vaccine is being rolled out because of its devastating impact on children and young people generally when the illness occurs.<\/p> <p> I could raise many other issues, but I do not have the time.  I ask the Taoiseach to comment on the article by Susan Mitchell last weekend on Sl&aacute;intecare in which she said the hospital groups would be broken up and merged into regional integrated care organisations, RICOs.  In a speech in November 2015, the Taoiseach heralded the hospital groups as central to reform.

Will the Taoiseach indicate what is the skillset and job specification of those six individuals?  Third, he announced some time ago that he would take a hands-on oversight role on health because one of the issues he has been concerned about, right back to our own time in government, is managing health expenditure.

Has he made changes to his Department to assist him with this particular crusade on broadband provision?  Given the clear failures to meet the targets that have been set, or to address increasing public concern on health and housing, does this not suggest the current approach to overseeing plans and co-ordination of action simply is not working?

The Minister of State will be familiar with these people because some of them reside in his constituency.  They have no last resort in circumstances in which their insurers, Home Bond and others have walked away.  I refer to those whose homes which have category 1 pyrite damage.  Such damage is not sufficient to qualify for inclusion in the scheme but it nevertheless renders people's homes valueless.  Those to whom I refer cannot sell their homes.  Are any measures being considered in this regard?  I hope we will look at expanding the scheme to deal with these people and give them some hope.  At the very least, we should consider that where such individuals carry out remediation work themselves, they should get the tax back or be permitted to write off the costs against future income.

Our work will remain incomplete if we fail to provide some option for those with category 1 pyrite damage because they have nowhere else to go.  It is a last-resort remediation scheme, which I debated prior to its implementation with the then Minister, Phil Hogan.  I was involved in putting the scheme together with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and others.  It was always intended to review the scheme with the potential to expand it.  While category 1 damage is not deemed significant within the meaning of the scheme, the home is nevertheless worth nothing and one cannot move on.  I know the Minister of State understands that those people are left in limbo.  A formal review of the scheme through the joint committee would be a way to proceed.

While we are open to teasing this out, I have asked many Deputies whether they could justify spending that money and they have said they could not.  As such, we need to find some other solution.  I am happy to engage around that but I am not convinced a formal review of the scheme will solve it.  We all worked hard to set up the scheme in the first place in 2011 to 2013 and there was a hope then that a levy could be put in place in order to secure funding for this matter.  That was not possible and we have had to rely on taxpayers' money to fund remediation in recent years.

Within these overall numbers, the 2018 build target was for the delivery of 4,969 social housing homes, 2,369, or 48%, of which had been delivered by the end of quarter 3.  My Department continued to work intensively with local authorities and approved housing bodies over the course of quarter 4 with a view to maximising delivery to year end and I expect to be in a position to provide indicative full-year delivery data in the coming weeks.  I will also be setting 2019 social housing delivery targets for each local authority.  I am satisfied that the significant expansion in the social housing construction programme over the course of 2018 provides a strong platform for increased build activity this year.<\/p>  <p>  Affordable housing is being facilitated through a range of measures.  Under the serviced sites fund, &euro;310 million will be made available from 2019 until 2021 to fund the provision of facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites to support the construction of over 6,000 affordable homes.  In response to a first call for proposals under the fund, I issued approval last month for funding for infrastructure projects costing &euro;43 million.  This funding will support the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes.<\/p><p>I expect to issue a second call for proposals under the fund shortly.<\/p> <p> Dublin City Council is working to deliver almost 250 affordable homes at O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road, with some 380 cost rental homes being progressed through pilot projects at St. Michael's estate in Inchicore and at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, will also yield an affordable housing dividend, with some 2,350 affordable homes being facilitated on sites benefiting from LIHAF funding.  A further 5,600 homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction.  To support further delivery, the Land Development Agency, which was established late last year, is actively pursuing the development of an initial tranche of eight sites yielding 3,000 homes, 30% of which will be affordable homes.  The timescales for the delivery of affordable housing will be one of the issues I will explore further as part of my next engagement with chief executives of local authorities in the coming weeks.  In 2019, record funding of &euro;2.4 billion is being made available to support activity in respect of housing programmes generally.  I am confident that this will underpin a further significant increase in momentum across all local authorities this year.<\/p> <p> The most recent data show the continuation of some very positive trends with regard to broader housing supply.  They indicate that we remain on track to reach the 25,000 target for new home delivery by 2020 as envisaged under Rebuilding Ireland.  Planning permissions were up 62% in the year to the end of September 2018.  Commencements have more than doubled since the end of 2015, with over 21,000 commencements in the year to October 2018.  According to CSO data, some 20,396 new homes became available for use in the year to the end of September 2018.  House prices and housing affordability vary significantly across the country.  In the year to October 2018, the median house price nationally was &euro;244,999.  It was highest in Dublin, at &euro;365,000.  Median prices were as low as &euro;100,000 in some areas.  In terms of supporting home ownership, nearly 9,500 applications have been approved under the help to buy scheme.  It is estimated that the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which was introduced last year, saw over 500 loan drawdowns by the end of 2018.  Delivery across all parts of the housing spectrum will continue to be afforded the highest priority by the Government over the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500022#U02400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547572200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Every new home that is built is welcome.

One of the most worrying aspects of the recent report of the Housing Supply Coordination Taskforce for Dublin is the indication that in the third quarter of last year, there was a 50% decrease in total construction activity in Dublin city and a 20% decrease in such activity in the Dublin region as a whole.  I would like the Minister to explain this very worrying development.  Does he think this trend will continue?<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I would like him to address is the social housing supply pipeline report, which we have discussed previously at the joint committee.  According to the report, just 35% of last year's target number of new-build social houses had been built by the end of the third quarter of 2018.  I am not a great fan of the leases that represent a large component of the Minister's targets.  The report in question indicated that just 20% or 25% of the leasing target had been achieved.

As I said in my initial reply, over 25,000 new homes were made available to live in over the 12-month period up to the end of September 2018.  There is no getting away from the fact that this marks a dramatic improvement on what was delivered in the previous 12-month period, up to the end of September 2017, and in the year before that.  It is not about painting a rosy picture; it is about speaking to the facts which show that supply has been increasing dramatically.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about the information that is available with regard to social housing completions up to the end of the third quarter of last year.  Between 35% and 40% of the build programme for the year had been completed by that date.  Significantly, this marked an 80% increase on what had been achieved by the third quarter of 2017.  This shows that local authorities had done a significant amount of additional work in a similar time period.  We also saw that much more activity was happening in the fourth quarter of 2017.  A big number of completions happened in that quarter.  Similar questions were asked about third quarter data in 2017.  We saw a dramatic increase in completions in the fourth quarter of that year because of the way the build programme is programmed and budgeted towards a strong level of delivery at the end of the year.

I expect we will see in those returns that some local authorities have exceeded their targets for the year across the different streams, and others have not done so.  The reason I said at the housing summit in January of last year that I would commit to targets for each local authority was that I wanted full transparency on exactly what is happening.  We know from the work we have done here in this D&aacute;il that funding has been made available, the policy is there and the resources are there.  Some local authorities have been very quick to ramp up their delivery of social housing, but others have not been as quick.  In a couple of weeks, we will publish the outputs against the targets that were published last year.  This will enable us to see exactly where each local authority is succeeding - for example, on the builds side.  Some local authorities might be doing more leasing than other local authorities.  We will be able to see where other local authorities are not as successful.  I hope this type of transparency will enable us to help local authorities that are not doing as well to up their games and match those local authorities that are doing well, for example in the context of the increase in social housing we are now seeing.<\/p>  <p>  I expect that because of the increase in social housing stock that happened over the course of 2018, we will find that fewer housing assistance payments were made in 2018 than in the previous year.

That is one of the reasons the task force report makes such comparisons.  It is a concern that the total level of construction in the city of Dublin, where housing need is greatest, is 50% lower than it was this time last year.  I am not clear on why that reduction is the case.  Rather than dismissing the question, it would be better for the Minister to give us an explanation, if he has one, of why there has been such a dramatic reduction by comparison with the same quarter in the previous year.  It is clear from the CSO figures that the total number of completions did not increase significantly in the third quarter of 2018 by comparison with the third quarter of 2017.  The number of units was 900 in each year.  While 900 extra homes is welcome, I do not think the Minister can call it \"dramatic\".  I will ask the same question again.  Is the Minister concerned about the central figure which shows that the total level of construction of new homes in Dublin city was 50% lower in the third quarter of last year than it was in the same quarter the previous year?  The year-on-year reduction in the Dublin region as a whole was 20%.  Does he have an explanation for that?  Is he confident that the drop in total construction is a one-off?  Is he confident that when we see the figures for the fourth quarter, we will see a levelling off or possibly an increase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500023#V00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1547572200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I want to follow up on what has been said about the timeframe for the affordable housing scheme.  As the Minister knows, one of Fianna F&aacute;il's major requests with regard to the housing budget prior to budget 2019 was that an affordable housing scheme would be established.  Since 2012, house prices have exploded by approximately 90%.  The average house price in Dublin is approximately &euro;368,000, which is six and a half times the average household income.  This shows that an affordable housing scheme for working people is urgently needed, especially in our urban centres.  Such a scheme would be of particular benefit to first-time buyers because it would give them some hope.  I am trying to get a handle on whether the Government has set a delivery target for 2019.  I understand that it takes time to get sites.  I also understand that a number of local authorities responded to the first call, although some of them did not.  Questions need to be asked about why some of them did not respond to the call for housing.<\/p><p>I want to get some specific targets and timelines regarding when we will see delivery of affordable homes for working people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500023#V00900","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547572800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for those questions.  It is important to note that while the Government supports subsidised housing schemes or affordable schemes, this does not mean that there are not affordable houses currently available in the market separate from those schemes.  If we note the number of transactions in housing up to the end of October 2018, including first-hand and second-hand homes, there were 53,000 transactions.  One in two of those transactions would have involved amounts of less than &euro;250,000.  Obviously, as we look more towards somewhere like Dublin, one in two of such transactions would have been for less than &euro;320,000 - the median price.  There are more challenges there and that is the reason we directed the first call at those local authorities in whose areas the affordability challenge is the greatest.  There are targets in those first schemes that were approved and we are now working with the second tranche in order to get them in line in terms of providing those schemes and getting houses built.  We are also looking at other ways of being able to deliver the serviced sites fund in a more truncated timeline than had previously been envisaged, even when we were having our discussions on the budget.  Affordability is a key concern for everyone in the House.  There is more that we have to do and we are constantly examining the position in order to see how we might improve matters.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have the quarter 3 report in front of me.  However, I recall thinking at the time that the way in which the material it contains was dealt with was funny and that perhaps it might have been misleading because what it seemed to imply was that construction in Dublin was down when this is simply not the case.  Construction, planning permissions and completions are up.  My understanding is that the reason matters looked like that in quarter 3 was because more completions had been done and therefore those active sites had closed.  I put a caveat on that because I do no have the report in front of me, but it is true to say that when we look at construction in 2018 and when we have the final figures for quarter 4, we will see that it is up dramatically in every part of the country on what it was in 2018, particularly in Dublin.  Planning permissions continue to increase as do commencement notices and completions.  We like to use the new CSO completions data which I requested when I first came into office.  We will have those figures.  The Central Bank is estimating 19,000 completions for 2018.  We believe the figure will be between 18,000 and 20,000.

This included more than 4,500 build, acquisition and leased homes delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Regarding the voids programme, some 605 voids were funded by my Department in the first three quarters of last year.  The issue of efficient tenanting of social housing is, of course, a matter for each local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Data in regard to fourth quarter of 2018 are currently being compiled and will be published shortly.

Last January, I committed to publishing individual targets for housing delivery in each local authority area in 2018, to enable greater transparency and accountability when it comes to increasing the stock of social housing.

Such reliance developed largely because there was not the capacity to build social housing, but we should be over that now.  We should be at a point whereby councils can deliver with the support of his Department.

Every delivery mechanism that increases the stock of social housing is important.  That is why we have a number of such mechanisms.

It is important to have that kind of redundancy in place.  If there are shocks that we have not anticipated, that might potentially take one stream of delivery away but we have others on which we can rely.  As a result, we will never be in a situation where there is nothing happening in the context of the delivery of social housing.<\/p>  <p>  What I expect to see with, for example, voids - we discussed this matter at a meeting of the relevant joint committee in December - is that we will exceed our target.

I also indicated to the joint committee that we will probably exceed our target for acquisitions.

That has been provided for and work since that has been funded to try to develop the mechanisms to make that happen.

These financial institutions have their own specific requirements for lending and investing.  One of the institutions included a requirement that the AHB concerned establish its own SPV, while the other two arrangements did not seek the establishment of such a vehicle, working instead through bilateral loan agreements with the AHBs.

In multi-unit developments, the \"person having control\" is generally the owner management company.

In many instances, builders and insurers have walked away, there is an argument and people are left in abeyance.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government did a good report on this, \"Safe as Houses?\", which contained several detailed recommendations.

They are areas where rents are very high, where there are quite a large number of rental properties and people are under huge pressure.

Then we want to see things like cost rental and we have the affordable schemes under way as well.  At the same time, we are ensuring that construction is increasing throughout the country.  There is no point talking about the price of a home if homes are not actually being built.

One of the things we have tried to do and have done successfully in Rebuilding Ireland is to ensure that, regardless of what happens to the economy in the future - for example, if there is a slowdown in growth or if something else happens - the State will always be providing public housing.  We have the different streams of delivery so that if, for example, an approved housing body gets into difficulty and can no longer provide social housing homes, the slack can be taken up by another approved housing body, a local authority or by way of Part V.  There will always be social housing homes being built regardless of what is happening in the wider economy.  We did not have that with the crash, not just because our construction industry fell apart but also because at that time social housing output was almost exclusively outsourced to the private sector.  When the private sector collapsed, with it came the collapse of social housing.<\/p>  <p>  What we are doing differently now is seeking to make sure that regardless of what is happening, social housing is always being done.  We have the provision of ring-fenced funding for the first time under Rebuilding Ireland, which had not happened before with the housing programme.  This year, we will spend more money on housing in general than has ever been spent previously in the history of the State.  With things like cost-rental, by actually getting those models up and working and financed by bodies like the European Investment Bank with super-low finance, we will be able to ensure that a much bigger section of housing that is being delivered to rent is being delivered for cost rental, not for the profit but actually to deliver sustainable housing solutions using public land.

It is about bringing in new skills, new enterprise opportunities and new job opportunities.  There is investment in market-led skills training, in community and social enterprises and in strategic projects, resulting in more than 300 jobs mainly, I think, in Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  The hospitality education and training centre in Roxboro has 250 people progressing from work training into employment.

While local authorities are driving this regeneration, it is important that every other Department also gets behind it along with the local groups across the sectors.  On the basis of my visits to these projects my sense is that that is happening.  We want to continue with that work.  Housing is only one part of it.

I argue that the review was fast-tracked due to Vera Twomey's fight for access to medicinal cannabis for her daughter.  In the two years since the report's publication nothing has been done.  We were critical of the report because of its limitations, its conservatism and its stipulation that medicinal cannabis should only be used in the treatment of three conditions.  Incredibly a major omission from the report related to chronic pain.  The greatest efficacy for medicinal cannabis is for chronic pain.<\/p>  <p>  The report was published two years ago and we still have no cannabis, no access and no programme.  Parents and patients are forced to go abroad and forced to break the law which is completely unsustainable.  Parents have run out of options.  They have tried everything clinically, but they have to leave the jurisdiction to obtain this medication.  The Government has failed them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health has come out with the mantra that it is a supply issue, but it is not a supply issue.  I do not find that a credible response.  This comes from institutionalised resistance by the HSE, the Department of Health, the HPRA, the Government and some in the medical profession.<\/p>  <p>  After waiting for two years, the people want meaningful progress on the issue.  Just before Christmas, Thailand, which has one of the most extreme anti-drug laws, passed legislation on the legalisation of medicinal cannabis.  It has also happened in Mexico and other countries.  Six months ago Britain had no policy on the matter and the Tory Government has changed even though it is extremely restrictive.<\/p>  <p>  In this country we have issued 13 licences to 13 individuals over two years.  I have been extremely critical of that licensing system.  It is extremely bureaucratic and cumbersome.  Most of the time people going to their doctor or specialist have a negative experience.  The specialists claim they do not have enough information about it and so forth.  That licensing system is not workable.<\/p>  <p>  If the patient is granted a licence, there is no guarantee that they will be reimbursed and in addition they have to go abroad to get the medication.  Therefore we are sending the patient to, in particular, the Netherlands to get the medication and bring it back.  The medical profession, the public and the vast majority of Deputies will say that is not sustainable.  I keep going on about this issue because of the injustice of normal parents seeking the best for their children having to go abroad and break the law which is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500030#CC00900","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1547577000,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Gino Kenny for raising this very important issue and apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who is unavailable.  The report of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, entitled Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, recommended that if access to cannabis is to be permitted for medical purposes, its use should only be initiated as part of a structured process of formal, ongoing clinical evaluation for a limited number of clearly defined medical conditions which have failed to respond to all other previous treatments and where there is at least modest evidence that cannabis may be effective.  Patients should be under the direct supervision of an appropriately trained and experienced medical consultant.  The specified medical conditions or indications are spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and severe, refractory or treatment-resistant epilepsy.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health undertook to establish an access programme to facilitate access to cannabis based treatments in certain circumstances, in line with the HPRA&rsquo;s recommendations.  An expert reference group was tasked with the development of operational, clinical and practice guidelines for this access programme.  The group was asked to advise on the development of operational, clinical and practice guidelines for healthcare professionals treating patients through an access programme.  These guidelines have been published on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website as part of a comprehensive repository of information on cannabis for medical use.  The purpose of the access programme is to facilitate access to cannabis based products or preparations that are of a standardised quality and which meet an acceptable level of quality assurance during the manufacturing process.  Availability of cannabis products that are of an appropriate quality standard and are affordable to patients is clearly critical in establishing the access programme.  Canada and the Netherlands are the only two countries that currently permit the export of cannabis products which meet acceptable quality control standards beyond their borders.  The Netherlands permits exports of cannabis dried herb but does not permit commercial export of oil-based cannabis formulations.  Department officials continue to work intensively on finding solutions to the supply of appropriate quality assured cannabis products for Irish patients.  Doctors continue to utilise the ministerial licence route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients.  Until suitable medical cannabis products are made available in Ireland, prescribers and their patients are sourcing the prescribed product from a pharmacy in the Netherlands, on foot of their medical prescription.  It is intended that the ministerial licence application scheme will continue to operate in parallel with the cannabis for medical use access programme after the programme becomes operational, for exceptional cases only and where there is an un-met clinical need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500031#DD00100","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1547577000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I do not know who writes this rubbish but this answer is exactly the same as all previous answers I have received.

The Minister of State made reference to the clinical guidelines which hold that the access programme will not recommend cannabis based products with THC for refractory epilepsy.  There are 13 licencees at the moment, nine of whom have epilepsy.  These patients are being prescribed cannabis with THC by specialist doctors.  What will happen to them when and if the access programme is up and running?  Will they stay in the ministerial licence system?  Will they still have to go abroad and will they continue to have fears around reimbursement?  This is an absolute mess.

I was contacted subsequently by a constituent who was concerned about the MenB vaccine which has been available to newborn infants since 1 October 2016 but not to children born before that date.  Following a week of news items and debate on various television programmes, the HSE and the Minister for Health are now saying that they do not want to extend the MenB vaccine by way of a catch-up programme.  If the vaccine was deemed suitable for children born after 1 October 2016, why is it not suitable for children born prior to that date?  What evidence is there to show that MenB can only be effective in newborns?  My research tells me that there is no evidence to that effect.  It can be as effective in a young child as in a young infant.  What would the one-off capital cost of a catch-up programme be?  If such a programme were to save even one life, it would be worth it.  A catch-up vaccine costs &euro;300 which is prohibitive for most families.

Parents were concerned, in many cases because their children had not received access to the vaccine.  In the recommendation from the officials charged with making it, we were told the vaccine should not be provided to children born before 2016, but no reason has been given.  Is it refused on grounds of safety, cost or efficacy, that is, whether it works?  The evidence is that it does, and last week people were strongly urged by the HSE to take up the vaccine.  Complaints were made that the rate of the uptake of the meningococcal vaccine among children has been suboptimal.

Invasive meningococcal disease is a vaccine-preventable disease which may present as meningitis or blood poisoning, and has a high mortality rate if untreated.  It may occur at any age but is most common in infancy and early childhood with an additional smaller peak of disease activity in adolescents and young adults.  There are five primary serogroups of the neisseria meningitidis bacteria that cause meningococcal disease.  Group B and group C are the most common forms in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The immunisation programme is based on the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.  The NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland which comprises experts from a number of specialties, including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The meningitis C vaccine was introduced in Ireland in 2000 to the infant immunisation schedule at two, four and six months of age.  In 2014, the NIAC updated guidance relating to meningitis C vaccination.  The committee recommended that two doses of meningitis C vaccine be given in early childhood and that an adolescent dose be given at 12 or 13 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the NIAC recommended that the meningitis B vaccine be included in the primary childhood immunisation programme if the vaccine could be made available at a cost-effective price.  Meningitis B disease is most common in babies under the age of one, of which the scheduling of the administration of the vaccine under the immunisation programme takes account.  The change recommended by the NIAC took effect from 1 December 2016 and the meningitis B vaccine is now given at two, four and 12 months of age.  Ireland was the second country in Europe to make the meningitis B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.  There are no plans to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  <\/p>  <p>  A total of 89 meningococcal cases were notified in 2018.  Some 11 cases of meningitis have been notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre since the last week of December, with three deaths notified among these cases.  The 11 cases notified compare with five cases for the same period last year.  Importantly, the HSE has noted that this does not represent an outbreak but instead reflects the known increased incidence of the disease in winter and early spring.  Provisional data on the strain types identified indicate that different strains of the disease are circulating.  In the cases of the three deaths, two different strain types were identified, neither of which was meningitis B.  <\/p>  <p>  In June 2018, the chair of the NIAC wrote to the Department to advise that it is engaged in a review of the epidemiology of meningococcal disease in Ireland and that it will develop recommendations based on these findings.  The Department awaits the outcome of the NIAC&rsquo;s deliberations.  Parents are strongly advised to ensure their children are immunised according to the vaccination programme.  Information on the disease and the immunisation program are available on the HSE&rsquo;s website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500032#EE00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1547577600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>The Minister of State stated the disease is \"most common in infancy and early childhood\", the latter being children born before October 2016.

That is contradictory and does not add up.  If young children are susceptible to meningitis B, there should be a vaccination programme for them.  I dread to think what will happen in the coming years if there is an incident, or a couple of incidents, leading to the death of a young child because of meningitis B.

As we all know, the CervicalCheck scandal that broke last year did huge damage to our confidence in the health system in this country.  Specifically, I want answers to the following matters.  At the time of the response by the Government to this issue, we found out that the Minister had established a review of all the slides of women who had cervical cancer by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG.  That review was to be concluded by May but it was not as it was not commenced.  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il in July that he was very disappointed it had not been commenced.  That was six months ago.  It was then meant to be concluded before the Scally report issued.  That did not happen either.  We know now, as of this week, that the Minister for Health has said that the slides are being transferred and the review should be concluded within six months.  That will be well over a year.  I do not believe it will be concluded even this year.<\/p>  <p>  There are real issues here.  In all these cases the women are waiting to find out if they have issues to deal with and, in particular, if there is negligence.  It is not acceptable that these timelines are so far out.  It will be the end of this year possibly, and it might not even get done this year.  That is not acceptable to Ms Vicky Phelan and to the 221 women and families affected.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the tribunal, which was to be set up after Mr. Justice Meenan's review, will possibly not be set up and be in place this year.  We have all the legislation on Brexit and on other matters, and which is complicated legislation.  However, that tribunal will not be in place and operating until 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Let us not beat around the bush on this matter.  I will 100% guarantee the Minister of State that a number of women will end up in the High Court and will have to give the details of their situation in the same way in which the late Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Vicky Phelan and others had to do and it will happen very soon because the Government has not honoured its commitments to ensure these women would not have to go through that ordeal.  I guarantee that this will happen.  People will come in here and will ask the Government questions, as will the media, because it is scandalous.<\/p>  <p>  I know of one woman who will be going through this process in the coming weeks and she and her family are terrified of it.  This woman should not have to go to the High Court.  She does not want to do so and wants to avail of this tribunal.  It is not acceptable that she should be put through this, given the situation she finds herself in.<\/p>  <p>  What is the status of the slides for the 221 women affected?  This has also been delayed for a long time.  We have no idea of the outcomes.  Why is there such a delay with this?  These are the priorities, and the ones we know about.  This is outside of the National Cancer Registry and the review that is being done by RCOG.  Why have we not got this information yet?  There needs to be a reprioritisation of this issue otherwise there is going to be a huge wake-up call for the Minister of State's Government because the public is still focused on it and it supports the women and the families affected.  This issue is not being prioritised by this Government.  It has gone off the priority radar.  I have given the Minister of State two examples - Mr. Justice Meenan's tribunal and the RCOG review.

This also provides me with the opportunity to update the House on this very important and urgent matter.  The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has been asked by the Government to undertake an independent expert panel review of the screening results of women who have developed cervical cancer and who had participated in the screening programme.  This will provide independent clinical assurance to women about the timing of their diagnosis and issues relating to their treatment and outcome.  Upon completion, each participant will be provided with an individual report, and an aggregated report will be submitted to the Minister for Health.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to publish this report, following Government approval.  Over the past number of months, a significant body of work has been undertaken by the Department of Health and by the HSE in progressing the expert panel review.<\/p>  <p>  This has included seeking the consent of women or their next of kin, where the woman has, sadly, died, for participation in the review.  This ensures that only those who wished to be involved would have their screening history examined.  The HSE also set up a dedicated information line, staffed by administrative and clinical staff to support those invited to participate in the review.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has noted that the validation of data held in relation to all the women eligible for the review has been a very complex process involving engagement between the National Screening service, the HSE acute hospital division and the National Cancer Registry Ireland.  Over 1,700 women or their next-of-kin have been written to, and approximately 1,100 have given their consent to be included.  This is a high participation rate of 62%, which indicates a very good level of engagement with the review.  The high participation rate will ensure that the expert panel can provide the necessary robust analysis in their aggregate report for the Minister.  The HSE has informed the Department of Health that it is expected the process of transferring the slides from the CervicalCheck laboratories to the expert panel review will commence later this month, which is the answer to the Deputy's question.  The RCOG expert panel has indicated that it will take at least six months from the commencement of the analysis of the slides, for the review to be completed.<\/p>  <p>  It is of paramount importance that the review is conducted in a way that ensures the quality, comprehensiveness and integrity of the results.

The completion of the review is a priority for the Government.  It is one key aspect of the work being undertaken to ensure the national cervical screening programme is as effective as it can be.  Separately, Dr. Gabriel Scally was asked to undertake a scoping inquiry and his final report was published on 12 September last.  An implementation plan has now been published on the website of the Department of Health.  Significant work is under way within the Department, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry in progressing the implementation of the 50 recommendations made by Dr. Scally in his report on CervicalCheck.  Significant funding has been allocated in budget 2019 to support the implementation of the recommendations.  In addition, funding will also support the extension in 2019 of the HPV vaccine to boys, as well as the introduction of HPV testing as the primary cervical screening test.  The work of the expert panel review, together with the implementation of the recommended improvements in the cervical screening programme, are vital to ensure that women can feel confident in the cervical screening programme.  Through a combination of screening and vaccination for boys and girls, we can make cervical cancer a rare disease in Ireland.  That is the Government's goal and we take it very seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500034#GG00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes","time":1547578800,"counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500034#GG00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1547578800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this particularly important issue.  I also thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply.  The Ceann Comhairle correctly identified the scheme as the Balyna scheme, which is an offshoot of the famous Allen-Killina group water scheme of many years ago, which was vintage in the 1970s.  It had many stages and extensions in the interim period, especially when the Department was directly responsible for administering the schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, in recent years there seems to have been a distraction of one sort or another and the issue affects an area composed of approximately 1,000 families and there are a couple of schools involved as well as the local community.  I will not go into the usual mode of criticising the neglect of rural areas.  Those people are citizens of this country and of County Kildare.  They deserve equal treatment with people anywhere else in the country.  A wellfield was developed in recent years but for some reason the local authority did not proceed with it.  I suspect that was for several reasons.<\/p>  <p>  I will describe how the aquifer in the area is operating.  In recent years the water has been flowing out over the top of an artesian borehole into a nearby stream.  At that stage it is free water coming out of the ground and it should have been possible to harness it.  First, there was going to be no refund but in the heel of the hunt there was an intervention and the subscribers have had 80% of their funding refunded.  However, that is not what they applied for in the first instance.  They applied for a group water scheme and the supply of water to their scheme.  It is more than 25 years since they first subscribed their money to the scheme.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed that the scheme was deemed to go no further, in particular given that a number of households in the catchment area have no supply of drinking water.  Their water supply is contaminated with what we call rust, namely iron deposits, and it also has heavy lime deposits which is damaging to washing machines and all kinds of modern kitchen appliances.  Sadly, the views and requirements of those people have been neglected without any reason being given.  What is worse, in the summer of 2018 the water supply of a school in the area was deemed to be unsafe and measures had to be put in place to ensure a water supply would continue to be provided.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Ceann Comhairle would agree with me if he was sitting where I am now.  There is no reason for the scheme not to be re-invented, resubscribed as necessary and for provision to be made for the men, women and children whose families are living in the area, all of whom are taxpayers and are entitled to the same treatment as everybody else.  The question is who decided that they are not entitled to this treatment.  Is there a reason for the lack of supply or can the water not be supplied economically?  It was always thus.  There were always people who could not subscribe to a scheme at a particular time.  It was left open to them to opt into a scheme at a later time if they wanted to.  In the final analysis, insofar as I am concerned, I have never seen a scheme abandoned in that fashion previously and I certainly do not want to see another one even if I live to be 100, which I do not intend to do, as the Ceann Comhairle will be glad to hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500034#GG00600","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1547578800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan is well on the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500034#GG00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1547578800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter with me as a Topical Issue.  As the Deputy knows well, group water schemes are independent community-owned enterprises and are an important means of providing piped water to rural areas where no such supply exists.  While I as Minister am responsible for overall policy direction and prioritisation of rural water services and for funding for the multi-annual rural water programme, local authorities lead on local implementation of the funding measures.  This includes the related administration and requisite capital assessments for inclusion in the funding programme.  Group schemes rely on Exchequer funding for infrastructural and maintenance support.  The Exchequer also subsidises group water schemes to ensure households do not have to pay for their domestic water supplies.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to address the specific matter raised by the Deputy, which is the group water scheme that was proposed for development in Balyna, County Kildare.  The Balyna scheme commenced planning its development in the early 1990s.  At that time the scheme proposed to supply more than 800 houses, plus farms and commercial premises, to a relatively large area of north-west County Kildare, covering approximately 4% to 5% of the area of the county.<\/p>  <p>  The Balyna scheme was to source its water from a public water supply &ndash; wellfields at Johnstownbridge and Robertstown, which also to be developed and was similarly dependent on Exchequer funding.  The Balyna scheme, which was equal to a medium sized public water supply scheme, was very large by group water scheme standards.  Accordingly, it was included in my Department's water services investment programme for the period 2007 to 2009 for public schemes.  There was little progress on the project over the next few years and it was not included in my Department's subsequent water services investment programme for the period 2010 to 2013.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  Irish Water's primary function is to provide clean safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment.  Irish Water, as single national utility, is taking a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning end investment, and to meeting customer requirements.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Kildare County Council and Irish Water met with the Balyna group water scheme in 2015.  It became clear at the meeting that there is little prospect of the Johnstownbridge wellfield scheme, the source of supply for the Balyna scheme, being included in the Irish Water capital investment programme.  I understand that alternatives were also considered and discussed at the meeting but were ruled out because they were not technically feasible.  Therefore, the scheme would not able to proceed either in the short or medium term and the promoters of the scheme were informed accordingly by Irish Water.  I understand that soon after the 2015 meeting the scheme decided to wind up.<\/p>  <p>  Acknowledging that costs were incurred in development work on the scheme, my Department recently agreed to recoup an amount of some &euro;79,000 to assist in meeting these costs.  Kildare County Council was advised of this position on 14 November 2018.  Households in the area of the scheme also have other alternatives to improve their domestic water supply if necessary.  The individual wells grant under my Department's rural water programme can be accessed through the council, to assist with the provision of necessary improvement of an individual water supply to households.  I again acknowledge the Deputy's interest in this matter.  I hope the update I have provided clarifies the evolution of this scheme in its initial years and what has happened in subsequent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500034#GG00800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1547579400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply but I do not accept or agree with the chronology of events as set out because I also attended meetings with the subscribers to the scheme in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and no indication was given at that stage that the scheme would have to cease.  In fact, the participants were most anxious that the scheme would proceed at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>  <p> I am not trying to embarrass the Minister.

No one is telling the Minister who made that decision but somebody made it and did so without the authority of the people of the area, who trusted they would be provided with a scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I cannot understand is that, long before Irish Water was invented, an indication was given to the effect that the local authority and the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government together did not want to proceed.

As we look forward in 2019, there are opportunities we need to grasp and challenges we need to understand and control.  This Bill, with the re-establishment of a board for the HSE providing independent oversight, is a key enabler of accountability, improvement and transformation in our health services.  The Minister for Health and I can think of no better moment than the start of a new year to work in collaboration with colleagues across the political spectrum to deliver on the commitment across this House, and as signed up to in Sl&aacute;intecare, to re-establish the board of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is our largest State agency, with a budget in excess of &euro;16 billion in 2019 and a substantial workforce, delivering vital services.  The transformation vision for health sector reform, as set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan, is an exciting change in our health services.  However, with this opportunity also comes significant risk, responsibility and work for the HSE corporately.  The HSE must be supported to deliver this work on the ground and, in the Minister's opinion, it is essential that a strong board be established to drive the strategic direction of the organisation, ensuring that appropriate systems for management and performance monitoring are in place, and to ensure accountability to the people of Ireland for decision-making processes in the HSE.  The board will also support the HSE in its decision-making capacity to ensure transparent, collective, evidence-based decisions in regard to the range and breadth of health and social care services it provides across the country.<\/p>  <p>  It is important, therefore, to outline the main objective of the Bill.  A directorate governance system in the HSE was put in place in 2013.  As the Minister said when bringing this Bill through the Seanad, this system allowed for co-ordination between senior management teams in the Department of Health and the HSE but, by its very nature and design, and by intent, this was a system that was always envisaged as an interim measure.  The time has now come, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendations, to establish an independent board governance structure for the HSE in place of the current directorate governance system.<\/p>  <p>  This board will be the governing body of the HSE and accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions.  High standards of integrity and probity will be expected of the board.  There are also central principles which must be at the heart of how the new governance model is implemented and which should guide the board.  As the governing body, the board will support transparency and accountability of actions, benefitting decision-making and management performance in the HSE.  Part of this will be for the board to challenge itself, as well as the HSE, to show how the HSE is getting value for the public funds it has been given.  Part of this will be to foster a culture of continuous improvement in the HSE.  The board will act collectively in order that all perspectives of patients, staff and the taxpayer will be taken into account, and will take decisions based on the public good.  However, in acting on these principles of independence and inclusivity, the board must ensure that fundamental values of care, compassion, trust and learning are well rooted throughout all services for which the HSE is responsible.<\/p>  <p>  Board members will be appointed by the Minister for Health following a Public Appointments Service, PAS, process for identifying suitable appointees.  This process is a robust, competencies-based process and will result in candidates being appointed to the board based on the skills and experience they bring to the board and their ability to engage in collective, complex decision-making.  The board will have strong competencies in key areas, giving leadership to guide, challenge and support the CEO and HSE executive team, ensuring accountability and delivering organisational transformation within our health service.  The PAS process ensures that members of the board will have experience and expertise in one or more of a range of areas, including corporate governance; clinical governance; quality assurance and patient safety; patient advocacy; strategic planning and change management, business management skills, financial planning and management; strategic human resource management; and public communications.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset, patient advocacy was identified as one of the core competencies needed in board members.  The Minister for Health was also clear on the Government's commitment to implementing in full the recommendations of the Scally scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme, including the recommendation in regard to advocacy and the new HSE board.  This issue was also raised by Senators as the Bill passed though the Seanad.  The Minister listened carefully to their concerns and reflected on the best way of delivering on the letter and spirit of Dr. Scally's recommendation.  He, therefore, tabled an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage in the Seanad to provide that at least two members of the HSE board have patient advocacy experience or expertise.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister would like to take this opportunity to update the House on progress with identifying board members.  In September 2018, after a demanding public appointments process, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane was selected as the chair designate of the HSE board.  He brings to that role a range of skills, experience and leadership from his extensive experience of the British Council, NHS England and as CEO of Macmillan Cancer Support.<\/p><p>The Public Appointments Service process to identify the other nine members of the board took place recently.  The Minister hopes to be in a position to make an announcement on the selection of members shortly.<\/p> <p> I turn now to the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains a number of standard provisions including the Short Title and collective citation of the Bill.  It also provides for the repeal of Part 3A of the Health Act 2004, which instituted the directorate governance structure.<\/p> <p> Part 2 allows for the required changes to be made to the Health Act 2004 to reflect the structural changes proposed in the Bill.  In essence, these changes include the establishment of an independent board, the appointment of a CEO to the HSE and the formulation of the values, principles and conditions to underpin this new structure.<\/p> <p> Section 7 proposes to insert a new Part 3B, sections 16N to 16U, into the 2004 Act to make provision for the membership and role of the new HSE board.  Section 16N(1) provides for a board of the HSE composed of ten members, namely a chairperson, deputy chairperson and eight ordinary members, all of whom will be appointed by the Minister for Health.  As I mentioned earlier, at least two members must be persons who have experience of, or expertise in, advocacy in respect of matters affecting patients.  The appointment and functions of the CEO of the HSE are covered by the insertion of a new Part 4A, sections 21A to 21G, into the 2004 Act.  As Deputies will be aware, we are currently in the process of recruiting a new director general for the HSE.  The successful applicant will become the new CEO of this important national State body under the legislation before the House.  This will be a pivotal appointment in improving the management, performance and quality of our health and social care services.<\/p> <p> The Bill also sets out the accountability structure between the CEO and Oireachtas committees.  Under the new section 21E, as provided for in section 8 of the Bill, the CEO of the HSE will be required to attend before Oireachtas committees to give an account of the general administration of the HSE.  The requirement for the CEO to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts is covered in the amendment to the Health Act 2004 proposed in section 17 of the Bill.  Sections 9 to 29 provide for other amendments to the Health Act 2004, mainly consequential to the new board and CEO structure and take account of the move to a board and CEO structure from the directorate governance structure.  Part 3 of the Bill consists of sections 30 to 34 and amends references to the director general in primary and secondary legislation.<\/p> <p> The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a board governance structure in the HSE to establish independent oversight.  The Minister is also considering amendments to further strengthen oversight and accountability and to support a more structured and strategic performance dialogue between his Department and the HSE.  I stress, however, that the Bill, including any amendments to it, is a first step.  The Minister is committed to continuing this journey of reform outside of the Bill by means of ongoing work to review, refine and refresh the performance and oversight framework for the HSE.  Sl&aacute;intecare has placed the reform and transformation of our health services into a space that transcends party politics because the importance of what we are doing goes beyond our political affiliations or ideological standpoints.  It is about providing the people with the best health service.  The health service they deserve is one based on equity, professionalism and compassion which places the patient at the core of all that it does.  The Minister believes re-establishing the board of the HSE is a key enabler of this and a fundamental building block to strengthen governance and oversight in our biggest State agency.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500035#HH00600","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547580000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>When healthcare is discussed in politics and in the media, the focus is almost exclusively on what is going wrong.  This relates to the numbers waiting to see doctors or to receive treatment, the number of people lying on trolleys in emergency departments, the number of people who cannot access mental health supports and the fact that the Government&rsquo;s response to the crisis is all talk and no action.  Patients, their families and their friends are exhausted.  Many conclude that nothing can be done and that the problems they see in health are normal and inevitable.  One regularly hears people say \"Sure, is that not just how health care is?\" .  As we look to 2019, it is essential to challenge this conclusion and demand better.  These failures, waiting lists and cost overruns are not inevitable and they do not exist in other countries.  They did not exist in the past in Ireland in the way they do now and there is no reason that they should exist in future.<\/p>  <p>  In the 2000s, incredible progress was made.  The nursing degree was introduced and the number of nursing student posts was doubled.  The smoking ban was introduced and healthcare investment grew substantially.  Some 53 separate healthcare bodies were consolidated into one, the national screening services were launched and 1,600 additional hospital beds were provided.  The number of consultant posts grew by 40% and the Health Information and Quality Authority was established.  There was a massive increase in home-care provision, the national cancer strategy was rolled out and so on and so forth.  These initiatives supported our healthcare professionals to make extraordinary progress in patient care in Ireland.  Waiting times fell from years to months and weeks.  The rate of death from cancer fell by 11% over the past ten years, while the rate of death from stroke fell by one third in the same period.  Infant mortality fell by a third while cardiovascular disease rates fell by 40%.  Deaths from heart attack fell by half and three in every four eligible women were screened for breast cancer.  These are amazing accomplishments, the credit for which belongs not to any political party here but to our healthcare clinicians who were able and were supported to do an extraordinary job.  We have some of the best trained healthcare professionals anywhere in the world.  The provide an outstanding level of care.  They mind us, heal us and save our lives every day.  They continue to make incredible progress to improve patient care in Ireland.  What, then, is the problem?  Why are there so many things on which we here, the media and patients focus?<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the highest healthcare spends in the world.  In spite of that, we have, somehow, among the fewest hospital beds in Europe and the lowest number of consultants per capita.  We have the longest waiting lists.  During the 2000s, waiting list times were reduced from years to months but notwithstanding the many billions in additional annual funding now provided, those waiting lists have gone back up from months to years.  Waiting times are longer than they have been at any time since we started to record them.  In some areas, children with special needs must wait three and a half years for treatment.  There are 35,000 people who have been waiting more than six months for a hospital appointment.  It was less than one third of that in 2010.  More than 3,000 children nationally are awaiting mental health appointments.  Last year, the number of people on trolleys in emergency departments hit 10,000 for the first time in the history of the State.   If one adds up the numbers on the lists of those waiting for appointments, therapy, diagnostics and mental health supports, one gets to 1 million.  It had topped 1 million by September.  Nothing like that has ever been seen before and nothing like it exists in any other European country.  There are 72,000 people waiting for in-patient hospital treatment.<\/p>  <p>  For every person who was waiting in 2010, when much less money was in the system than there is today, there are 16 people waiting at the start of 2019.  That is how bad things have got.  We compared the situation to that in the United Kingdom and found that when one accounts for population size, there are 200 people on waiting lists in Ireland for every one person waiting in the UK.  We are 200 times worse than the UK at getting people treated before a year has elapsed.  The current out-patient list stands at over 500,000 while the number of those waiting over one year stands at more than 150,000.  That would fill the Aviva Stadium three times over.  The one exception to this trend is where the national treatment purchase fund has been deployed.  The Government talks regularly about the improvements that have been made and I do not blame it for that, but they are targeted.  What the Government does not say, of course, is that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which it resisted for years, came about on foot of the confidence and supply agreement.  General practice is on its knees and nurses and midwives are looking at a national strike for only the second time in 100 years.  There is an unprecedented recruitment crisis in the context of hospital consultants.  Mental health services are falling apart in many areas.  Health overruns are now consistently above &euro;600 million a year, which never happened before.<\/p>  <p>  The national children's hospital is an interesting case study.  It was meant to cost less than &euro;500 million but the latest figure is over &euro;1.7 billion.  In December, the Taoiseach told us the cost had risen to &euro;1.4 billion and we have gone up by &euro;300 million in the three or four weeks since.<\/p><p>How expensive is that?  The most expensive hospital ever built anywhere in the world is the New Royal Adelaide Hospital in Australia.  That facility was built at a cost of approximately &euro;1.5 billion and has 800 beds.  The new children's hospital will cost significantly more than the most expensive hospital ever built anywhere in the world, even though it will have a little more than half the number of beds.  This means that when the national children's hospital has been built, the people will have paid approximately twice as much per bed as the cost of the most expensive hospital ever built anywhere in the world.  That requires a staggering level of incompetence and systems failure to pull off.<\/p> <p> What is going on?  How is Ireland spending more public money than ever before on healthcare?  We are spending more than most countries on Earth.  At the same time, we are suffering from the longest waiting lists in Europe, the longest waiting lists we have ever had and a series of enormous overspends.  How is this happening?  How is so much valuable money being so badly wasted?  Much of the blame rests with actions taken or not taken by this Government since 2011.  It has managed to alienate pretty much the entire healthcare workforce, including general practitioners, consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, therapists, nurses and midwives.  The implementation of new initiatives like the national children's hospital has been incredibly poor, as have been the efforts to control costs.<\/p> <p> The Government has wrought organisational chaos on the system.  In 2011, it announced that the HSE was to be scrapped.  It said that in the future, healthcare in Ireland would be funded by universal health insurance.  That was the big idea.  In 2012, in front of all the national cameras, the Government disbanded the board of the HSE.  It marched the board out publicly in front of the cameras for everyone to watch on the news that evening.  In 2014, the Government reiterated that it would disband the HSE and gave a date for this.  The then Minister for Health and current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, stated that the HSE would be gone by 2020.  The Government had no idea what it would replace the HSE with.  In 2016, the Government said it was no longer planning to abolish the HSE or to pursue the universal health insurance model of funding.<\/p> <p> The only long-term strategy is not a Government strategy.  An Oireachtas committee came up with the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  The latter may have various flaws but is the only game in town.  As a vision document, it is pretty good and quite ambitious.  It was recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare plan that the board of the HSE should be put back in place.  The Bill before the House has not resulted from a Government initiative.  The Government did not wake up and realise that it should not have marched the board of the HSE out and destroyed governance in our healthcare system.  It did not come up with the idea of bringing the board back.  It was made clear in a report drawn up by this House that the biggest, most important, most complicated and most expensive system in our country self-evidently needs a board.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, every single Sl&aacute;intecare implementation deadline has been missed so far.  By my reckoning, approximately &euro;20 million, in real terms, was allocated for Sl&aacute;intecare in budget 2019.  The Government said on budget day that &euro;200 million was being provided for Sl&aacute;intecare, but that was not the case.  That money was being provided for various initiatives.  The Government said that all of them were Sl&aacute;intecare initiatives, but that was not the case.  The money was being provided for doing a bunch of sensible things, like scaling up, as part of usual business.  The actual money for Sl&aacute;intecare in the budget was approximately &euro;20 million.  It is estimated in the Sl&aacute;intecare plan that approximately &euro;1 billion is needed for Sl&aacute;intecare.  Conservatively, it would probably be possible to get Sl&aacute;intecare off the ground for approximately &euro;500 million in any given year.  It is probable that progress could be made on that basis.  For every &euro;1 that the Government has attributed to Sl&aacute;intecare for this year, between &euro;25 and &euro;50 is probably needed.  That is how seriously Sl&aacute;intecare is being taken.<\/p> <p> The former director general of the HSE, Tony O'Brien, appeared before various Oireachtas committees last year in the heat of the CervicalCheck scandal.  He was under a lot of pressure from various Members of this House not just in respect of CervicalCheck but also on the performance of the HSE and on waiting lists.  He repeatedly made the point that when he was hired by the Government in 2011 or 2012, he was instructed that his job was to dismantle the HSE.  That is what he was told his job was.  He said that he never received any further instructions.  He was told that in the future, funding would be provided through universal health insurance.  He never received any further instructions.<\/p> <p> The Scally report pointed out the implications of the lack of a HSE board.  It directly linked the lack of proper governance and the lack of a HSE board to the catastrophic governance failures that were a feature of the CervicalCheck scandal.  Getting rid of the board was not just a mistake, it was an extraordinary mistake.  The guy who was hired was told that his job was to dismantle the HSE.  His board was taken away and he was not given any further instructions on the HSE.  This extraordinary mistake has led to massive cost overruns, including an overrun of between &euro;700 million and &euro;750 million last year.  Nothing like that had ever happened before.  The spending overruns on the national children's hospital mean that this project is probably unlike any healthcare project that has been pursued anywhere in the world.  We are going to pay twice as much per bed as the most expensive hospital ever built.<\/p> <p> The lack of a board, coupled with this organisational chaos, goes a long way towards explaining how the same managers with the same doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals, but with way more money, are providing a service that is much more difficult to access.  It should not be more difficult to access.  If the same doctors, nurses and managers are given way more money, they should be able to provide a more accessible service.  Instead, chaos has been wrought throughout the HSE.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill, which takes one small but important step towards reversing that damage by reinstating the board.<\/p> <p> As we face into 2019, we should be under no illusions about the scale of the challenge before us.  Organisational stability within the HSE has been lost.  It has to be re-established.  Financial control has been completely lost and must be regained.  The HSE is on fire in terms of financial control.  Our healthcare professionals - nurses, midwives, doctors and dentists - must be engaged with.  They have been systematically alienated.  They are not being engaged with.  The Government is due to announce a new oral health strategy in the next two or three weeks.  The Irish Dental Association made it clear in yesterday's newspapers that dentists have not been consulted on the upcoming oral health strategy.  That is where matters stand.<\/p> <p> This has to stop.  Within the HSE, the Department and this House, there needs to be a culture of actively engaging with and listening to our clinicians.  We should respect them and treat them properly, but that has not been happening.  If we can stabilise the HSE as an organisation, if we can somehow get control of funding and financing, which has spiralled completely out of control, if we can begin to understand that the people who lead our healthcare system are the clinicians and if we can listen to, engage with and respect those clinicians, we can start to rebuild the healthcare system that patients, the public, clinicians and everyone working within the HSE deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500036#JJ00200","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547580600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important legislation, some of which is technical in nature.  It seeks to reintroduce a board to oversee the operations of the HSE.  I hope this overarching premise means it will have beneficial ramifications for our health service.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting to look at how we got here.  Before I was elected to this House, I had the privilege of representing workers.  It was very interesting to hear Deputy Donnelly say that workers should be listened to.  I represented workers when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  They were roundly ignored.  I was sitting in Government Buildings when the Taoiseach of the day, in the face of industrial action by tens of thousands of healthcare workers, called a general election, suspended the talks and literally walked away from the table.  Deputy Donnelly has told an interesting story, but the history of his party is one of ignoring front-line healthcare professionals.  I hope it will change.  I hope a lesson has been learned.<\/p>  <p>  Just six years have passed since Fine Gael abolished the board of the HSE in favour of creating the office of HSE director general and conferring more powers on the Minister.<\/p><p>What the Minister exactly did with those additional powers is anyone&rsquo;s guess because I do not know.<\/p> <p> The dismantlement of the HSE was announced by the then Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, who pushed strongly for what he called reform of the health system.  It was not based on available evidence or on information from having talked to experts or front-line healthcare professionals but simply on the belief that he was right.  The changes and the decision to scrap the executive were agreed in the 2011 programme for Government between Fine Gael and the Labour Party. <\/p> <p> In the Seanad, the Minister had the temerity to say that the directorate governance system of the HSE introduced through the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013 was by its nature and design, and by intent, always envisaged as an interim measure.  The Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health went on to say that the executive would be fully dismantled by 2020.  Unsurprisingly, that did not materialise and we find ourselves discussing this Bill and the board must return.  <\/p> <p> The new board will be a slimmed down, nine-person version of the former HSE board.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the original legislation that sought to dissolve the board, not because we thought the board was perfect or was working well but because the legislation that delivered its removal was unclear, weakened the health service through the removal of the board for purposes of oversight, bestowed too much additional power on the Minister and did not give the D&aacute;il additional powers of scrutiny or make the Minister further answerable to the D&aacute;il.  I do not believe there is another multi-billion euro healthcare body operating in the world without an appropriate board to provide oversight.  It is welcome, therefore, that the Government has seen fit to reverse the decision of six years ago, but let us not fool ourselves, that was not the Government's decision.  That was a recommendation of the committee that produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I and others sat on that committee and that is from where it came.  If pats on the back are being handed out, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall should probably get one ahead of anyone who sits at the Cabinet table.<\/p> <p> It was important that amendments were made in the Seanad, which guaranteed that two of the people appointed under the section to support the board would have experience or expertise in advocacy relating to matters affecting patients.  This followed the suggestions made by Professor Gabriel Scally in the scoping inquiry.  It was unfortunate that the same accommodation could not be made to include worker representatives on the HSE board.  We believe that workers should have some form of representation on the board, and that healthcare and medical professionals would be of major benefit to the board in its workings.  The participation of healthcare workers would be an asset.  It would help to ensure a deeper understanding of clinical issues, best practice, quality indicators and other issues related to the safety and quality of care and overall delivery of healthcare by the HSE.  Sinn F&eacute;in had submitted amendments to this end, but they were ruled out of order.  We will submit reworded amendments to this effect on Committee Stage and we hope they will be supported.  There is nothing wrong with having healthcare workers represented on the board that oversees the operation of their workplace.  More important, they have much to offer in terms of their membership of the board and the expertise they can bring to it.<\/p> <p> The Government claims that the new board will restore public confidence in the HSE through a series of actions to strengthen the management, governance and accountability of the organisation.  Those are grand claims but they are almost a photocopy of the claims that were made when the board was dissolved.  The board had to be removed to have all this accountability and now the board has to be brought back to have accountability; perhaps it could stop reforming the structures and just focus on accountability.  Only greater oversight and proper accountability of the board by the Minister of the day will ensure better governance, accountability and delivery of health services.  It is a pity that was not the view six years ago.  If the then Minister had the bit between his teeth and was interested in reform, then he probably could have done a better job six years ago.<\/p> <p> There is no other multi-billion euro healthcare body operating in the world without an appropriate board and, therefore, I welcome the reintroduction of the HSE board because it is standard practice for public bodies to have an independent board, which operates at arm's length from Government and provides independent oversight, particularly in the context of the spending of public money and accountability to the taxpayer.<\/p> <p> It was a sad state of affairs for the former Minister to do away with the necessary and important checks and balances.  However, without radically altering how the board will operate in comparison with the previous regime and the previous board, then the Government is doomed to make the same mistakes again.  It is important that the board has the right mix of talents and does not just comprise ministerial appointees who are appointed for political reasons.  I do not believe the Minister would do that but he will not be the Minister forever.  When we look at the Cabinet table I see people who have made appointments to boards which made as much sense as Caligula appointing his horse to be a Roman consul.  These people will be tasked with an important job.  We need to make sure that they are the right people who can deliver.  It is a multi-billion euro organisation, a great deal of taxpayers' money goes into it and a great deal of accountability is needed.<\/p> <p> We need to ensure against manipulation in appointing members to boards on one hand and ensuring the best and most appropriate people are appointed on the other.  It is important that any member appointed to the HSE board is familiar with, and committed to, the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.    We have a unique chance to fix some of the problems in our health service, and that cannot be achieved if those on the board of the HSE are not committed to working towards that through Sl&aacute;intecare.  By that, I mean a commitment to public health service, to the delivery of healthcare on the basis of need and not ability to pay, and fully funded by the public purse, not through privatisation but through the public health system.  <\/p> <p> Progressive corporate governance reform at the highest level of the corporate body of the HSE is also needed.  When the HSE board was dissolved in 2012, there was an opportunity to progressively reform the organisation to achieve the highest level of corporate governance.  This was not done and amendments to strengthen the legislation at the time were not facilitated.  That was one of the reasons we did not support its dissolution.  We have the same concerns again regarding this legislation.  We would like the provisions strengthened to make the Minister for Health and the new board more accountable to the D&aacute;il.  The board must also robustly hold the Minister to account, and the Oireachtas must be able to hold the chairman of the board to account.  The re-establishment of the board cannot give the Minister the opportunity to hide behind or push aside the HSE when it suits.  The HSE has been described as a growing monster by many but, in the main, that is because it has not been given adequate political direction by successive Ministers for Health.  We need only note its initial foundation by the then Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  He just amalgamated the old health boards.  In saying that, I am being kind to him because he just shoved them together.  It made no sense.  Deputy Donnelly has treated us to a few of the greatest hits of Fianna F&aacute;il in government but the ones I remember were the recruitment moratorium, privatisation and the first recorded overnight trolley wait.<\/p> <p> Since the board was dissolved, there has been a sequence of bad moves and a lack of sensible direction.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the key fundamental principles, as outlined by the Minister, of independence, inclusiveness and compassion.  At times, those principles are sorely missing, not on the part of nurses, doctors, healthcare professionals who, as we know, have them in abundance, but in the boardroom.<\/p> <p> The board, as the governing body, must be independent, transparent and ensure accountability in its actions in order that people can have confidence in the decision-making and management processes within the HSE.  Furthermore, it must be committed to a truly public health system.  We cannot have members of the board who have conflicts of interest such as stakes in private hospitals, or video medicine systems, which for the avoidance of doubt are the antitheses of what it means to deliver public healthcare.  While we need experience on the board, we do not need conflicts of interest.  We need to see commitment to improvement, to the proper and prudent use of public funds, to combating waste and to ensuring direct health benefits and better outcomes for those who use the health service.  If my memory serves me correctly, the HSE is the largest employer in the State. <\/p><p>In that context, an understanding of workers' rights and not simply human resource management is really important.<\/p> <p> I welcome the appointment of Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane as the chair-designate of the new board.  I understand the Public Appointments Service process to appointment a chair was exhaustive.  I know Mr. Devane has experience in health service provision from his time in Britain where he was chief executive of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support and served as a non-executive director of the National Health Service, NHS.  Perhaps, in time, when we have Mr. Devane in front of the Joint Committee on Health, I will get an opportunity to ask him about his time with the NHS in England and see what his analysis is of the performance of the NHS during that period and of attempts by the Tories to privatise elements of the NHS.  A huge job lies ahead for the new board, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office, and I wish them well in their endeavours.  I look forward to further debating this Bill on Committee Stage.  I have outlined the type of amendments that Sinn F&eacute;in will bring forward and look forward to engaging with Mr. Devane.<\/p> <p> In the few minutes I have remaining, it would be remiss of me not to mention the impending strike by nurses and midwives in our health service.  One of the frustrating factors as a person who represented healthcare workers which is still true today is that one is often engaging with people who cannot make decisions.  In the absence of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, one is talking to HSE and health service officials, but those people are not empowered to make that decision.  That is extremely frustrating for healthcare professionals and obviously frustrating for nurses and midwives because they have found that they have no option but to take industrial action.  We know that industrial action is the last port of call for any worker, especially nurses and midwives.  I would like to see a situation where the HSE is empowered to make those decisions in the interest of the health service, to have the power to actively negotiate and engage with those healthcare professionals.<\/p> <p> I heard Deputy Donnelly's view and that of Fianna F&aacute;il about how well paid nurses are.  I heard that view about how well paid nurses are in the Joint Committee in Health in July.  I do not share that view because we are competing with English-speaking countries where nurses are paid more and their conditions are better.  That is why our nurses are leaving.  We need to have a health service that is empowered to deal with the front-line healthcare professionals we need, put in place strategies and know that it has the power to make good on any commitments that it makes at the negotiating table.  I do not think that every person in this Chamber shares the Fianna F&aacute;il view about how well-paid our nurses are and I do not think that we should be making comparisons between our nurses and healthcare workers in other jurisdictions except those that the nurses are going to, because we are competing with those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500037#KK00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547581800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Reilly just did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500039#MM00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1547581800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>When those people leave, we know that they are leaving to go to countries where the pay is better.

The Ceann Comhairle will be delighted to know that I will stick to the Bill.  We will have other opportunities to deal with many of the serious issues raised by previous speakers in the next 24 hours.  This legislation is important.  It is concise.  The Government was bounced into producing it because of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the committee which Deputy O'Reilly and I sat on for 11 months with Deputy Shortall as the Chair, which recommended this.  As somebody who is into the detail of the cervical cancer debacle, it was quite obvious as a result of what many of us saw transpire at that time in the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Health, both which I am a member of, when speaking to HSE and Department of Health officials, that governance had collapsed and that an independent board was necessary.  What was recommended in Sl&aacute;intecare and the greatest example of why it was needed was before us in the cervical cancer situation.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the decision to abolish the board in 2012 was foolish.  The structures that were supposedly to be put in place never materialised.  I looked back at the cervical cancer debacle and some of the committee hearings.  I cannot remember whether it was at the Committee of Public Accounts or Joint Committee on Health - it was probably at both - and I remember questioning accountability and how this could happen.  The national screening programme, which had been quite successful, had fallen down the organisational structure of the HSE.  The history of how it fell down from the top tier of the management and directorate of the HSE, a number of years ago, is that a number of directors, working together, made a decision in a vacuum away from accountability to a board or anyone and it slipped down two tiers.  As a result, the director in charge of it did not have a clue what was going on.  At a management level, the directors speaking together at directorate meetings were obviously raising the issue and screening programmes were discussed.  The audit which we all know about now never really reached the top table.  No one was asking questions.  Screening was merged into being part of the directorate in relation to wellness, so it was mixed up with that.  It is very positive for that to be in the media and publicly known.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very specific area and there was a lack of oversight and management structures that were decided by the HSE directorate, which I accept there is an element of need for, and there was no board to ask if and how something is working and other things that are necessary where boards are in place, including challenging a CEO or a management team, which is the directors in this case.  As a result of that, the issues that we are going through did not get to the top and we would not have known if not for Vicky Phelan and everyone in this House knows that.  To be fair and balanced, the CEO was left in this situation so I will not criticise them for that.  There was a structure with a tier of directors and a CEO without an accountable board.  It is an organisation with a budget of &euro;17 billion or more, the largest number of employees of any State company in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is small but it is incredibly important to ensure good governance, accountability and transparency.  It is in tandem with other legislation which will go through the Houses, especially in the area of open disclosure.  I wish the chair-designate the best.  I also wish the new CEO the best, whoever that is, if we can find one.  It is proving difficult to find one.  Things that will have to happen in tandem are the psychological changeover in the HSE regarding open disclosure, honesty, transparency and how to deal with the public.<\/p><p>The establishment of the independent board and the putting in place of governance measures will not happen overnight.  The board will be put in place, but the actual process by which it will do its work will have to be quite closely overseen by the Minister and his Department.  We need to be very careful about the type of people who are appointed to the board.  It is not that easy to get people onto boards any more - it is incredibly difficult - so we need to ensure that we get the right people across all the disciplines listed in the Bill, a matter to which the Minister referred previously.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has changed the composition of the board in order to add two patient advocates.  This is very positive.  Dr. Scally referred to this matter.  I want to be clear about one thing - and this must happen, particularly in healthcare but also, potentially, in the context of other boards - namely, that the members will have to be reimbursed.  I do not mean travelling expenses, I mean full reimbursement in respect of loss of pay.  Otherwise, it will not be possible to get a proper cross-section of society.  I have raised this matter on half a dozen occasions.  Let us consider the type of people we need to get on these boards.  There is nothing wrong with one, but we do not want two retirees who can afford membership financially.  We also need people with real-life experiences who have been through a lot.  The majority of the families affected by CervicalCheck and related issues include young women.  The best patient advocate when it comes to such a topic and cancer in general could come from that sector, but one of those people will not be able to go on the board because they will not be able to afford to give up the time from their job.  I know this from the groups that have already been set up with the HSE in respect of CervicalCheck.  Some of the people giving up their time on these boards will not be able to continue doing so long-term because they have jobs to go to and children to feed and cannot afford the loss of income.  In that context, I plead with the Minister of State: if he takes away one small point I make, he should bear this in mind.  It is something we need to ensure across Government and across politics.<br\/><br\/>The new board and chair designate need to set a new tone as to how they make the management structure and the management team accountable.  Dare I say it, from an accountability point of view, Oireachtas committees have had to fill a void because of the fact that there has not been accountability at board level.  What is happening at present is, because there is no such accountability, I and others, particularly members of the two committees to which I referred, are going into a level of detail which we probably should not need to go into because there is no board to do it.  We are getting into levels of detail on medical and health issues, and also spend issues on other committees, because of the fact that there is no board.  There is a vacuum and we are possibly not being consistent in targeting some of the main issues to the degree we should as a result of the level of detail we are having to get into.  The new board, the new chair designate, can set a new tone in ensuring that the issues that need to be dealt with at that level are dealt with and that issues that need to be dealt with in here, at the highest macro level, will be dealt with in here as well.<br\/><br\/>As stated, the board must be inclusive and comprise a cross section of society with different skills.  The patient advocates must represent a cross-section of society as well.  It is also important that the new board fit in with the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy.  Some work has been done in this regard with the establishment of the programme office, the advisory group, etc.  It is important that in setting this up we do not just think it will act in some way like other boards.  There is a strategy in place here that is the only show in town and across politics.  Any Minister for Health should glide into the slipstream of this because it is a strategy that has been adopted by an overall majority of the House.  It is important that the new board understands that while the chair designate is accountable to the Minister, there is also the requirement to be part of this larger trans-politics, trans-time strategy because Governments and Ministers come and go.  This is critically important as well and needs to be fitted in.<br\/><br\/>I wish to say a few words about the issue of regional alignment.  This is a real bugbear of mine, and I know it is for some other Deputies.  As part of the new structures, the whole alignment of the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and the hospital groups must happen but in an organised fashion because otherwise the accountability chain up and down gets broken because people do not know who is aligned to whom geographically.  All of us in this House deal with, as I call it, the acute side and the non-acute primary, community and continuing care, PCCC, side.  I am lucky enough in the mid-west, where they are aligned.  I would say it is the only place in the country where they are aligned.  Well, most of it is aligned.  Part of it in south Tipperary is not, but that is a different story.  This causes real issues, so this alignment needs to happen relatively quickly and in tandem with the setting up of the new regional boards.  Those boards are massively important and have the potential to be extremely effective because they will get into a level of detail that the national board will not be able to get into.  There are specific issues that can then be dealt with at regional level.  There are specific issues which are higher-priority in the south-east than they are in the north-west and <i>vice versa<\/i>- one can pick any regions in the country - so those regional boards are critically important but they must happen following on from the alignment of the non-acute and the acute.<br\/><br\/>One issue that arises relates to the role of politicians at local level.  I am not necessarily saying we should go back to the old health boards, but certainly when it came to accountability, common sense and a focus on the minds of regional health managers, they did not necessarily do that bad a job.  Therefore, while not going back to that whole structure, we do need a format which is not just about the platitudes that happen in many regions at present whereby a couple of times a year there is a meeting and we are given presentations, etc.  I obtain a great deal of information from our regional managers, but the point is that, in general, there is a role for politicians at the local level as well because there are cross-over issues that happen at local authority level - transport, environment and other issues - that need to be taken on board.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board two or three of my comments, which I think are progressive.  We will support the Bill.  We will look at one or two amendments, potentially - not many.  The HSE is too bureaucratic and too large.  Dr. Scally stated in his report, &quot;It [was] difficult to see who, under this configuration, was representing the patient and public interest&quot;.  It is to be hoped that with the change in structures and the new chairperson designate, the new board, a new CEO, the new transparency, the new open disclosure, the new regional structures aligned and regional boards, that statement will become redundant.  I fear, however, that it will take some time and much concentration to reach that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500039#MM00400","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547583000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018, as it is aptly or ineptly titled.  It should probably be renamed the \"Moving the Deck-chairs on the Titanic Bill\".  The Bill provides for the establishment of a nine-person board for the HSE and that board will be accountable to the Minister for Health in the performance of its functions.  That is certainly a novel idea.  The introduction of accountability into the HSE is as novel a notion as one will get anywhere.  I do not say that tongue in cheek; I mean it from the bottom of my heart.  It is novel that a system that has been to the forefront in lack of public accountability and near total failure at senior management level is going to hold anyone to account.  I wonder what we think will be achieved by means of this Bill.  Apparently, it makes the new board accountable to the Minister for Health.  Imagine that: the board will be accountable to the Minister.  My God, that is a new one - someone in the HSE will be accountable.  What an insult to the people's intelligence.  Those who drafted this Bill and the Minister who oversaw it should have a bit of cop-on.<\/p>  <p>  This Minister has presided over the greatest levels of health system dysfunction in the history of the State yet he remains in place.  He is accountable to no one and only remains in his position because, in all likelihood, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, is more than happy to sacrifice him as a public scapegoat for the catastrophic failures of the HSE.  The Taoiseach got his litany today in answer to the question of how all the bad things happened when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Minister for Social Welfare and in respect of the national children's hospital.  He knew nothing about the latter and did not want to know.  I never heard such poppycock from a Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  Let us see how accountable the Minister is and the HSE has been.  There are record numbers of patients on trolleys and the Minister remains in his job.  There are 498 people on trolleys today.  A task force was set up eight years ago when there were 250 or so on trolleys.  What did that achieve?  Psychiatric nurses are at breaking point and are about to take to the streets but the Minister is still in his job and smiling.  There is a &euro;750 million overspend in respect of the national children's hospital - despite every warning being provided that this would happen - and the Minister is still in his job.  He was warned that it the wrong site was designated.  We had medical experts in here, people who had built hospitals in America and the UK, and he would not listen.  It is the wrong location and will always be the wrong location.  We cannot get nurses and in this case we cannot mind the nurses going to and from the hospital.  People will not be able to park there and there will not be a helipad but the Minister is still smiling and in his job.  The overspend is growing and the Taoiseach informed us earlier that we should continue to overspend because it is going to be a good project.  Such logic baffles me.<\/p>  <p>  There are chronic and unending waiting lists for children requiring assessment of needs, with no sign of the Government becoming accountable in that regard either.  Children are waiting for orthodontic treatment and for scoliosis operations.  My colleagues, Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Collins, are hoping that Brexit will not happen because they have booked buses - these are in addition to the 16 busloads they have already sent - to transport people to Belfast under the EU directive scheme in order to get cataracts removed and have knee and hip operations and many other procedures.  The sad part is that we are paying for this out of our health budget in any event.<\/p>  <p>  What little hope can we place in a Bill which merely seeks to create an alternative bureaucratic structure with a failing and sprawling organisation?  The Bill seeks to make the new CEO accountable to the nine-member board.  Was Mr. Tony O'Brien ever held accountable?  No, he was not.  Look at the cervical cancer scare.  Were those who presided over the slow death of the health service ever held accountable?  No, they were not.  There was some accountability, as Deputy Kelly said, when we had the local health boards and locally elected politicians on them.  What hope can we place in a Bill that is so very much like this Government, namely, all window-dressing and absolutely no substance?  None whatsoever.  I have no faith whatsoever in this legislation.  It is both rubbish and ill-judged.  We know that, no matter what happens, the Minister, even if he was to go out shooting people, would not resign.  That is the chronic disrespect the Government has for this House and for the general public.  It is a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500041#OO00100","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1547583000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The HSE was established in 2005.  In 2013, a directorate governance structure was put in place for the HSE as a temporary measure until the latter's functions could be moved elsewhere.  Under the health reform programme, this directorate structure has remained in place for longer than planned.  The Government states that this is because of the complexities of the health reform programme.  However, I argue that it is down to poor management of our health service by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Health recommended in its Sl&aacute;intecare report that an independent board for the HSE be established.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report is intended to be a ten-year programme to transform our health and social care services.  It promises to prevent illness in our population.  Where can the Minister of State demonstrate that this is happening in our society?  I have begged the Government to make the FreeStyle Libre device for people with diabetes reimbursable for all patients with the condition.  I welcome the fact that the Government has listened to some of what I have requested and that this device has been reimbursed for diabetic patients between the ages of four and 21.  This is not sufficient, however.  It is estimated that over 15,600 people over the age of 80 suffer from diabetes.  If the Minister were serious about promoting the health of our population, he would extend the current reimbursement for the FreeStyle Libre service to be included in the long-term illness scheme to all patients with diabetes.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot go without mentioning the battle that children such as Ava Barry had to suffer to get access to life-changing medicinal cannabis.  Medicinal cannabis has been legalised in more than ten European countries, in Canada and Australia and in 30 US states.  We need to seriously consider legalising medicinal cannabis for sick children and adults in order to improve the quality of life of those suffering seizures and chronic pain.  The battle that Vera Twomey had to fight in order to get medicinal cannabis for her daughter, Ava, was unnecessary.  This mother had enough on her plate without having to fight the State and the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p> The HSE claims to provide the majority of care close to home.  Since I was elected, I have called on the Government time and again to address the serious issue of caring for our elderly either at home or in nursing homes under the fair deal scheme.  Carers are waiting between three and six months, in some cases longer, to get their payments.  It is outrageous that these people are expected to survive on no money until their payments finally come through.<\/p>  <p>  West Cork is home to the largest population of elderly people in Ireland.  These individuals are waiting to get into respite care.  We need extra beds for respite and waiting times need to be reduced.  I would love to see a system whereby care is provided on the basis of need.  I do not see any semblance of this in our health system.  I have advocated for years to keep Bantry General Hospital open.  I and others lobbied the previous Government not to close the 24-hour accident and emergency department there.  Unfortunately, it did not listen and waiting lists are now getting longer and longer.  That frustrates me.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key points of the Sl&aacute;intecare report relates to the creation of a system whereby care will be provided on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.  This is fooling the people into thinking that the Government will deliver on its promise.  The Government is running the health service inefficiently and codding the people into thinking that it is trying to do better.  I want to see real action and I want rural hospitals such as that in Bantry to operate to their full potential.<\/p>  <p>  Another lovely promise that has been made relates to the provision of a service especially for those who need it most.  How can members of the Government look people in the eye and expect them to believe that this will happen?  We have been hearing promises of this sort for donkey's years but there is no real delivery in respect of them.  In west Cork alone, many people have been waiting for cataract operations for up to five years.  Many of these people are elderly.  To date, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I have taken 20 busloads of people for cataract procedures.  I have a list of up to 100 people in my office and I have spent most of the day working to try to get cataract, hip and knee operations and all sorts of other procedures for them in Northern Ireland.  Those operations and procedures could be out at Bantry General Hospital.  A cataract operation takes approximately 15 minutes.  The Government is failing in its duty of care for people by allowing them go to another jurisdiction for these simple procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government promises \"the most fundamental reform of our health services in the history of the State\".  The Government needs to face the reality that people and healthcare professionals do not believe our health system is working.  Our nurses and psychiatric nurses are deeply unhappy, and with good cause.  The Government needs to listen to these nurses because there is no doubt regarding the need for change in the health service.  We need to see real action now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500041#OO00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1547583600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on the most important issue we have to deal with in the Chamber.  Members are aware the HSE was put in place in January 2005.  I and a lot of other people believe that since that happened our health service has deteriorated to such an extent that it is now in a total shambles.  Nobody knows - I do not know - how it will be redeemed or retrieved or what will happen to give people confidence in our health system because they clearly do not have it at present.<\/p>  <p>  There are four Ministers or Ministers of State with responsibility for health.  We have a Government, Taoiseach and President but we do not have a health service.  We do not have enough nurses and the nurses we have are not being properly paid.  We do not have enough doctors or consultants.  I know of one patient who has been waiting for three years for surgery.  He cannot get it because he is a public patient and the consultant who was dealing with him at the start went into private practice and has not been replaced.  The man has to sit in an arm chair half standing up.  He cannot lie down and he cannot sit properly.  He has to try to stay half standing.  That is the way he is day in, day out.  There is no accountability.  That is what is wrong.  <\/p>  <p>  Kenmare community hospital has been opened four or five years now.  I give credit to one man and no other.  That is Jackie Healy-Rae who fought hard to get that community hospital for Kenmare.  Lo and behold, it is only half opened.  It is not even half open because 21 beds are still not open.  It is the same story for the new hospital in Dingle.  A local farmer gave the Government the land for the new hospital free of charge and only half the hospital is operating at present.  There are offices in other parts of it.  That is what is happening in Kerry.  During the roasting summer there were 22, 23, 24 and 25 patients on trolleys day after day.  That is what was happening down in Kerry.  What will it be like before the springtime if the winter gets bad?  <\/p>  <p>  The big worry I have for the people of Kerry is we have been promised a new hospital for Killarney but if this children's hospital in Dublin is going to double its cost, will the funding be there for it?  People have to wait six months for carers.  Elderly people like to stay at home as long as they can.  They would like to die at home.  That is what they want.  It is not fair that people have to wait six months to get carers.  <\/p>  <p>  Look at what is happening with private health insurance.  When a patient goes into hospital someone comes to see if they are on private health insurance.  If they are, their health insurance provider is charged over &euro;800 for the stay in the hospital whereas it would only be &euro;75 otherwise.  What is that doing to private health insurance but driving the cost up and driving it beyond the reach of working people who would dearly like to have proper cover for their families?  It is not attainable now because of the cost.  <\/p>  <p>  People are in pain and people are going blind.  We are taking buses to Belfast week after week with people having operations for cataracts, hips, knees, tonsils and many different things.  They can be done in Belfast and people can get the money back from the HSE when they come back but we cannot do them in our own hospitals in the south of Ireland.  Why is it?  I do not know if the Minister of State is listening to me or not.  I do not know if he really cares because he made a statement a few weeks ago that in 20 years' time there will be no nursing homes in Ireland.  Where are we going to go with the people then?  What will we do with them?  If we are going to close the nursing homes, what other place is there for them?  <\/p>  <p>  I have gone beyond my time.

If one thinks back to dealing with the old southern health board, it was a board that had teeth.  There were politicians, medical staff and consultants on the old southern health board.  I was very privileged to have given many years with our late father, Jackie Healy-Rae, to sitting on the southern health board.  It had teeth.  When one went to a meeting, one had a say at the time of budget.  It had to pass a budget the same as any local authority.  They were meaningful boards but lo and behold a genius of a Government at the time thought it was right to do away with it and scrap it because it was working.  The first HSE debarred politicians completely.  When they realised they were making a right dog's dinner out of it, they decided they better bring the politicians back in.  That was some bit of a help because we had politicians who were genuinely worried and concerned about their constituents and they worked on the new HSE boards.  They are in no way related to what was there in the past and the structures that were there on the old health boards.  When we talk about having confidence in the health service, how could we have confidence in a Minister or Department when one looks at what they are doing with the children's hospital and the massive over-run?  What Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said is right.  Somebody will have to pay for it.  In other words, will the likes of the community hospital we are promised for the great town of Killarney be affected?  The first thing that will happen is that other infrastructural projects that have to go ahead in the county of Kerry and throughout the rest of the country will be slashed and cut and will not be delivered on at all because the story will be that everything will be needed to pay for the over-runs in the hospital they are putting in the wrong place.  We have seen over the past number of years the difference coming into Dublin city in the morning.  It does not matter whether it is 5.30, 6.30, 7.30 or 8.30 in the morning, one is choked coming into the town.  Here we are telling people we have compounded it further by locating the new children's hospital in a place where a helicopter cannot land and where we will not be able to bring people by ambulance.  It is absolutely insane.  The over-run is totally insane.<\/p>  <p>  I have to raise the fact that in County Kerry, we have two fine hospitals in Cahersiveen and Kenmare where they are crying out for more long-stay beds.  We have excellent matrons and staff.  Every one of them is operating to their maximum.  At the same time the hospital is not because there are rooms and beds that have never been opened.  The funny thing about it is when one talks about Kenmare there was an urgent situation where in the space of one day, upstairs had to open because of an eventuality.  There was no problem.  It was able to open in a day.  It was filled but then it had to be closed again.  There is total and absolute mismanagement and insanity by people in charge, not the local people on the ground.  A massive amount of money is being wasted.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a new system in place now in the HSE which I want to tell the House about and put on the record.  Before if one was operating in a community hospital, whether in Kerry or Donegal, when goods were delivered, one signed off for the goods.  If ten boxes came in, whoever was responsible counted the boxes and signed for them.  That does not happen anymore.  The ten boxes are delivered.  No one in the hospital can sign for them.  A person has to travel out to sign for them.  When I say \"travel out\", that could be 20 miles, 40 miles or 50 miles.  The person has to travel from an office to sign for goods being delivered to a community hospital.  It is a fact.  I would not say it on the record of the D&aacute;il if it was not a fact.  It is more waste and insanity.  The people working in our health service know it is happening and it is shocking.  When will we see proper management?  Money is being thrown at the health service but it is not being spent wisely.  That is why I am asking how we can have confidence in what is happening.<\/p><p>Last Saturday, I saw 24 people from around Kerry who need to come to Dublin to have their cataracts removed.  How can we have confidence in a health service when we cannot do that in the south and have to send them up to Dublin?  We can give them the money back and they can avail of the service in the North but we cannot carry out the operations in the South.  It is absolutely crazy that people awaiting hip operations and children waiting for tonsils to be removed have to be sent to the North.  That is extremely unfair.  There is discomfort on these people even though we have tried to make it as comfortable as possible.  It is crazy to tell people in their 80s that they have to go to the North to have cataract removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500042#PP00200","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547584200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  Like a number of other Deputies, I spent some time on one of the original health boards - a lot of time, in fact - during which I learned something about the health services.  I was interested to hear the various submissions.  A comparison has been made between the old health boards and the current structure.  I agree with that comparison.  The thing that has been obviously missing for the past several years is proper connectivity within the system.  The health services on the ground were remote from the HSE.  When he was appointed in 2005, I asked the first chief executive of the HSE whether the structure of the organisation as set out was appropriate to facilitate the delivery of health services.  He said he did not know.  It was an honest answer but history has proven it was not the appropriate vehicle.  Everybody has said it was wrong of a previous Minister to abolish the board of the HSE.

What actually happened was that in the month of September, a diktat would come down from the Minister for Health which said \"You are over budget, pull it up.\"  We were to apply the hand brake and correct it immediately.  That is what happened.  That is why it did not go any further.  That was lost.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Donnelly also alluded to a few other things.  He referred to the long years of waiting lists.  I am awfully sorry to disabuse him of that idea.  He mentioned three and a half years but a wait of eight years was commonplace back in those days.  I dealt with such matters.  I was there at the time.  An individual would ask if we could do something about his or her hip; maybe eight years had passed since it was determined he or she should have a hip replacement and he or she was in severe pain and came in asking if somebody could do anything about it.  All that has been forgotten and it has been convenient to forget it.  That is the way it was then.<\/p>  <p>  For all the time I was on the health boards, we were always told by experts that politicians should not be involved at all and that it was a matter for experts.  They had expert opinion and the answers to all the problems.  Even though all the groups and professionals were represented there, the idea was to get politicians off the boards in order that proper management and the closure of some hospitals could take place.  That is a quotation.  We were repeatedly told that there were too many hospital beds in the country and that half of them should be closed down.  Half of them were nearly closed down.  That was at a time when we had experts telling us where we were going wrong.   What we did have, to be fair to them - Deputy Kelly referred to this - were politicians at local and national level who were on the board.  These individuals were not always right but they had a point of view and they were not shy of expressing it.  Whenever they expressed their point of view, they represented the people.  I am not sure whether the board structure we have in place now is the answer.  There needs to be representatives of the professionals involved in decision-making at local and regional level.  In the period from 2005 up to now, we have had separate bodies working in watertight compartments as it were, none wanting to concede to another.  As a result we have had dissatisfaction.  Many of the very good professionals working in the health services will tell us that readily.  They will say their views are never listened to.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that the Bill before the House will at least address the issue of the chain of command.  That is essential.  It must start with the patient, whose interest must be represented at all times.  Everything else is secondary.  I hate to be harping on but Deputy Donnelly also mentioned the Royal Adelaide Hospital.  He is right.  It is one of the most expensive hospitals in the world.  It was opened in 2017 and was some years in preparation.  It cost the Australians $2 billion and there are 800 beds in it.  I am confirming that the Deputy was right about this because he was wrong in most of the other things he said.  Time will tell when we find out what the original guesstimate was for the cost of the Royal Adelaide.  I do not know but I am sure somebody out  there does.  Deputy Donnelly would have volunteered that information to the House if he knew it and I would encourage him to so do.<\/p>  <p>  The theory is that a regional structure will be introduced.  However, I am not so sure it is integrated in the plan to the extent it should be.  If that regional structure does not apply, I do not think this system is ever going to work.  Spokespersons on both sides of the House have addressed this over a long period.  The Manchester formula was the one recommended in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s when we had a different system.  The idea of the Manchester formula was that, since the population of the greater Manchester area and Calderdale was similar to that of this country, it was quite obvious that the same costs should apply.  This was absolute and total rubbish.  It was a totally different system, particularly in view of the vast geographic expanse of this country and the compact area that one could virtually walk across in a couple of hours in the Manchester.  I had the occasion of visiting the system there as a former school colleague of mine, God rest him, was mayor in Calderdale.  It was a case of chalk and cheese.  We eventually determined that the single board we got in the form of the HSE was going to be the answer but it was not.  That was obvious from the outset.<\/p><p>Constant dripping does not wear a stone in these particular cases.  I cannot understand why it takes so long to get the message across, even for fools like me and other Deputies who were members of those old boards and know how they worked.  If any kind of emergency that necessitated action occurred, we would have know all about it at the board meeting on the Thursday night.  We were tipped off about it beforehand and we immediately knew what was going to happen.  If it did not happen, there were problems.  That was long before computers were available and there was considerably less technology, but it worked quickly.<\/p> <p> I mentioned that all the professionals were represented on the old boards.  Between the old health boards and the local health advisory authorities, every aspect of the health profession was represented.  Everybody could contribute at meetings that were held regularly.  Pharmacists, nurses, psychiatric nurses, special needs professionals, doctors, local GPs and the consultants were all there.  They had the opportunity to exchange views on a one-to-one basis.  They did not have to write to them down or send emails.  They did not have to wait for a fortnight or three weeks for someone to come back to them; they got the information there and then.  It was laid on and ready to function.<\/p> <p> I recall visiting a hospital where things were not going as they should have been.  It is interesting how things have changed.  It was obvious to those unfortunate members of what was then known as the health board visiting committee that things were not going right.  We were advised not to cause too much disturbance because there could be a general and all-out strike as a result of our intervention.  It must be remembered that we were only ordinary elected public representatives and we would not know about the niceties of these things.  However, such was the severity and serious nature of the problem that we decided it would be better to have an all-out strike or a closure of the facility unless something changed.  Amazingly, within 12 hours everything changed.  The things that could not be done beforehand were all changed.  Suddenly, all the neglect that had not been challenged before could be and was addressed.<\/p> <p> We lack some of those things now.  We are not as good at that as we were in the past, which is sad.  Those self-contained compartments have grown up in the meantime.  A walled system has developed and, as a result, we do not get the same interaction and transmission of authority.  We do not get the same accountability or good governance.  We do not get the same quality of response and delivery of services to the patient.  This means that things are becoming increasingly expensive.<\/p> <p> I hate to raise this matter.  Deputy Donnelly kindly reminded me of something that amused me.  In 2010, the number of patients on waiting lists was approximately one third of what it is today; that is true.  However, the Deputy missed out on one thing.  The country was bankrupt at the time - flat broke.  Therefore the overrun was a bigger one than anybody thought about.  I am sure he meant to mention that to the House, but he just stopped and I can understand how that would happen.  I hate to mention these things-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500043#QQ00800","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547584800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>No, the Deputy does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500044#RR00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1547584800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>-----but Deputy Donnelly inspired me when he set about dissecting what happened in recent years.

It did not prove itself to be what I thought it was.  It proved to me what I thought it would not be and unfortunately I was right.  It was decided way back that by taking politicians out of the system, party politics would no longer play a role in the delivery of health services.  Party politics is part of the democratic system.  It did not always fail in the past.  The health boards were set up in 1970 by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister.  The thinking behind that structure was sound.  They needed to be improved and helped as time passed.  They needed to take account of changing times and changed responsibilities, but they did not always do that.  There were problems with the boards, but they had structures that could be operated and could be made to work effectively for the people.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that the current proposals will work; I am not so sure.  I hope I am not right, but in four, five or seven years or whenever, somebody may point out that we did not really do it right and that a different structure will be needed.  How long can we go on like that?  How long can we keep pointing out these things and asking ourselves when we will do it?<\/p>  <p>  I had great respect for the previous chief executive of the HSE.  I know that the CervicalCheck thing was a difficult situation that arose and he vacated the post somewhat before he was due to do so.  I was not all that impressed with his swipe at the Minister on his way out the door.  If we want to play politics with these things, we can all play politics.  That applies to those both inside and outside the party political system.  I have no difficulty with that and I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would have no difficulty with it either.  One of the greatest things about the involvement in public life is that we still can and will continue to interact and make our views known at every opportunity that it is required.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly and I have exchanged views from time to time.  He mentioned one of the things that is required and the intention is to provide it.  That is, very simply, good governance with the transparency, accountability and all that goes with it.  I was once a member of a committee that carried out an inquiry into the banking system and deposit interest retention tax in this country.  It was very beneficial to the State and raised approximately &euro;2 billion for the State in an earlier time.  After a six-month inquiry, the conclusion and recommendations were that there would be good governance, good fiduciary practice, accountability, and regular monitoring by different accountancy firms so that there would be no crossover and nothing would be missed.  That was in 1999.<\/p>  <p>  We can have all the good ideas in the world, but we need to be more effective than that was in terms of what should have followed - incidentally it was the only sworn inquiry that was concluded in the history of this House.  I think it is effective.  However, the problem was that when we finished and the personalities involved went off about their business, it only took them less than four years to unwind the intentions of what the committee proposed.  We can have all the good intentions in the world, but unless what we recommend in this House is taken seriously, nothing will change and everything will continue as before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500044#RR00500","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1547584800,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I was due to share time with Deputy Eugene Murphy but I do not see him in the House.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill, which is basically a legislative &quot;<i>mea culpa<\/i>&quot; on the part of a former Minister, Senator Reilly, whose bull-in-a-china-shop approach to health reform is now being reversed by this Bill.  I listened to Deputy Durkan's homage to the past.<\/p><p>There was a lot of sense in what he said about the old health boards.  When I was first elected to this House in 2007, the HSE held regular quarterly consultative meetings on a county by county basis, at which hospital and local HSE managers engaged with public representatives.  They were very effective meetings but during the tenure of the former Minister for Health, now Senator Reilly, they too disappeared.  The hospital groups were established and they considered themselves to be unaccountable to local elected representatives.  The final vestige of involvement on the part of local representatives was fully cleared away and the aforementioned regular local meetings do not happen now.  There is no longer any opportunity for engagement with local management.<\/p> <p> The abolition of the board of the HSE was based on the then Minister's pursuit of the so-called Dutch model of healthcare, which was going to be the panacea for all of our wants, like some sort of classy beer.  It was supposed to improve accountability and delivery by the HSE but it was never going to happen.  Unfortunately, we have had so many incidents since which have proved that.  The lack of accountability at the very top has spread right across the organisation.  When one deals with local managers and local front-line staff, one sees their passion for the patient, which is fantastic and immense.  However, as one goes up through the layers of the organisation, that passion gets lost.<\/p> <p> One of the issues with this Bill is that it only provides for a minimum of two patient representatives on the board.  That is too few.  Everyone on the board should have the interests of the patient at heart.  Everyone on the board should be able to live the patient's experience and the patient's journey.  There should also be representatives of patient's relatives and parents who depend on the HSE for day-to-day services so that somebody around the board table can tell the story of cancelled appointments, of not being able to access physiotherapy, occupational therapy or home care packages.  Someone needs to tell the story of being told on Tuesday that surgery scheduled for Wednesday has been cancelled.  Those experiences need to be heard at board level.  If HSE and Department of Health managers are unwilling to hear them from directly elected representatives, then we must ensure that in the design of this new board, the patient experience is central.  We must also ensure that other issues and experiences take second place.<\/p> <p> &Oacute;s rud &eacute; go mbeidh an bord seo i gceannas ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte in &Eacute;irinn, ba cheart go mbeadh Gaeilge ag na daoine a bheidh ar an mbord.

T&aacute; a fhios agam go mb&iacute;onn cruinnithe ag coiste na Gaeilge - t&aacute; an Teachta Connolly i gceannas ar an gcoiste sin - faoin g&aacute; at&aacute; ann go mbeadh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh Gaeilge ag gach duine a oibr&iacute;onn sa ch&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte agus go h&aacute;irithe ag gach ball den bhord.<\/p> <p> We must look at the experience of the HSE since 2011 and the abolition of its board.  We have had budget overruns which Deputy Durkan dismissed as an annual event that always happens but it should not always happen.  It happens because there is no proper financial planning in place and no accountability when things go wrong.  We have had so many controversies, both locally and nationally, that have impacted negatively on patient care and on confidence in the health service.  Nobody is accountable for that.  Nobody has paid for involvement in these controversies with his or her job.  There is no sense of transformational change taking place which is what any new board must grasp and run with.  We must ask whether by changing the board we are actually changing the culture of the organisation because that is the most important change.  We are all committed to going down the Sl&aacute;intecare path but that path must have at its heart a change in the culture of service delivery.  We must put the patient first.  We must make the required investment and put in place the proper legislative and regulatory framework required for primary care.  Any investment in primary care must make it an attractive place to work.  At the moment we are alienating our primary care professionals to such an extent that they are fleeing the country for Canada, Australia and other countries whose health systems are set up in such a way as to allow them to be general practitioners or physiotherapist rather than all that they are expected to be here.  Instead of just paying lipservice to primary care, the new HSE board should place primary care at its heart because so many problems can be dealt with in that setting rather than the hospital setting.  When patients attend hospitals, they must receive a timely service.  They should not, depending on the time of year, have to wait on trolleys for hours.  Primary care services must be available on a consistent basis across the country which is the not the case at the moment.  Primary care services vary from area to area, from CHO to CHO, depending on the availability of therapists or appointments.  Patients living in some parts of the country can access health services far quicker than patients living in other areas.  A central board of governance of a national health organisation must be committed to consistency and continuity of care, regardless of geography.  There is some care that cannot be provided locally, including specialist care.  Tough decisions were taken in this House, in the context of the old HSE structure, on the reform of cardiac and cancer care services which were opposed by Members opposite at the time.  Those reforms have delivered much improved outcomes but there must be a consistency in the delivery of services across the country.  There must be a genuine understanding of the patient's journey in terms of the way that care is delivered and accessed and the board of the HSE must take on the responsibility in that regard.<\/p> <p> The board must have teeth and HSE management must be answerable to it.  Senior management in the HSE has not been held to account to any great extent.  The Oireachtas health committee does a superb job but is limited in what it can do in terms of holding senior managers to account.  Calling senior HSE managers before the Committee of Public Accounts on a crisis by crisis basis is not necessarily the best way to get consistent answers or reform.  The new board must be entrusted with the responsibility for doing that.  <\/p> <p> The board itself must also be answerable to the people.  Producing an annual glossy report full of staged pictures of people looking happy does not amount to responsibility or accountability.  Members of the board must be accountable to this House in a different and new way.  No longer will the standard procedures suffice whereby board members appear before committees of this House and spend hours at a time trying not to answer questions posed, having spent tens of thousands of euro of taxpayer's money on communications consultants who told them how to do that.  That is not responsibility or accountability to the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health has now decided to reverse the car that was driven through the health service by the former Minister for Health, James Reilly, without any concern for the damage caused.  However, he needs to make sure that he is driving a new car and that the board of the HSE has the strength, capacity and skill set to represent the interests of patients, first and foremost and of communities.  The board must ensure consistency and continuity of care across the country insofar as possible.  Where services cannot be spread evenly across the country, the board must ensure that patients have access to care that is timely and that is delivered in a manner suited to their condition and respecting of their dignity as patients and citizens of this republic.<\/p> <p> The people who are asked to take on the duties of this board will have a very big responsibility.  We will have to take that responsibility into account when considering the remuneration of board members.  If we want the right people for this job, the standard way of rewarding them may not suffice.  Thought will have to be given to the kind of person and the kind of experience we want around that table.  Every single person who signs up to become a member of the board of the HSE must know from the beginning that his or her job is to represent patients.  The people who are treated in our health service deserve representation and must know that if their treatment goes wrong or if they have a negative experience, there is someone at the board table who will stand up for them, for their community and for their health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500044#RR00600","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1547585400,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of D\u00e1il","time":1547586000,"counter":512,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500046#TT00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1547586000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Before we proceed with Private Members' business, I call on the Chief Whip, Deputy Kyne, to make an announcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500046#TT00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1547586000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders or the Order of Business today, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 7.48 p.m. on Thursday and shall adjourn following the conclusion of proceedings on Second Stage of No. 58, Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Restoration of Birthright Citizenship) Bill 2017.<\/p>  <p>  No. 38, statements on the Government's Brexit preparedness, shall be brought to a conclusion after three hours and 40 minutes.

Last year, when the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, it referred to a number of reports it had published in connection with the Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, on agricultural and rural crime, for which I compliment it.  The reports were authored by Dr. Kathleen Moore-Walsh and Louise Walsh of WIT.  They were based on a survey of 861 farmers across Ireland and make for stark reading.  If a survey of 861 people was done by any of the polling companies, the media and everyone else would be jumping up and down about it.  <\/p><p>The first report outlined that of the 861 respondents, 66% had experienced some form of crime which affected them, their farms or their homes, while some 41% of respondents had been the victim of crime more than once.  The second report quantified the average value of theft on farms at &euro;1,818 and that incidents of vandalism and criminal damage cost the farmer on average some &euro;360.  The report also highlighted that a significant level of agricultural crime is not reported.  It is an important issue and it is a pity that the Minister of justice and the Ministers of State are not present to listen.  Do they care?  Agricultural crimes are not reported to insurance companies.  Some 94 incidents of theft and 348 incidents of vandalism, criminal damage or trespass were not reported to insurance companies. <\/p><p>The third report showed that farmers were also reluctant to report crime to the Garda, which is more worrying and concerning.  Some 45% of respondents did not report instances of agricultural crime to garda&iacute;.  According to the ICSA and the authors of the study, the reasons can be summarised as a sense of hopelessness that anything could be done, which would be worrying for the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Ministers of State, if they were in the Chamber to listen.  Is m&oacute;r an trua an rud sin.<\/p><p>What the ICSA and WIT reports show is that rural crime is underestimated by official figures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To demonstrate that this is a real and ongoing issue, I note a report this morning on Tipp FM Radio - my local radio station, which has been the subject of a take-over by the Kerry brigade in recent days - in which a victim of seven burglaries on his premises on the Tipperary-Offaly border feared someone might take the law into his or her own hands.  I do not advocate that but what will the victims do?  I listened to a gentleman's fear and terror at a crime meeting recently organised by the Irish Farmers Association in Nenagh, north Tipperary.  He showed us a box of keys larger than a can of Coke in his pocket, and he has triple locks and quadruple locks on his gates, doors and everything else.  His house was cut down, torn away, stripped away and penetrated.  His home is his castle.  For all of us, that is an abominable situation.<\/p><p>The report noted that the latest attack on Ashgate farm in Barn was last Sunday night, that is, after the meeting in Nenagh, and hundreds of euro worth of equipment was taken, which is shocking.  Clive Clarke is one of a number of homeowners and businesses that have been hit over the years along the Tipperary-Offaly border, and he is brave enough to come out and speak about it.  He is a young, able and physically strong man.  It is not acceptable and he should not have to be in that vulnerable situation.  I salute Clive Clarke and the many other Clive Clarkes who are trying to defend themselves and their neighbours when it is clear there are not enough garda&iacute; on the ground doing this kind of work.  He said the local garda&iacute; are doing their best but the criminals know the system is in their favour.  The local garda&iacute;, including sergeants, attended that meeting.  In my area of south Tipperary, the local garda in charge is Superintendent Willy Leahy, while in Tipperary town it is Superintendent Pat O'Connor.  There are inspectors, sergeants and garda&iacute;, but we do not have enough of them.  We have been starved of Garda numbers in Tipperary, which has been one of the worst-resourced areas in the country since Templemore opened.  All the garda&iacute; are trained in the county but they are posted everywhere except Tipperary.  Something radical needs to be done about that.<\/p><p>The Save Our Local Community group was set up in the wake of a spate of burglaries in recent years.  Clive Clarke, however, who was a member of the group, said people are losing faith in the system.  Imagine that.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is not present, but the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on justice, Deputy O'Callaghan, is.  It is shocking that people are losing faith in the system.  We will celebrate the centenary of the first D&aacute;il next Monday, but people are losing faith in the system.  Is it any wonder?  T&aacute; an t-Aire ag teacht anois.  Clive Clarke fears that unless something is done to tackle the problem once and for all, someone might take the law into his or her own hands, which it is not something I or anyone else in the House advocates.  <\/p><p>The report clearly captures what we are debating and what is motivating us to bring the issue before the D&aacute;il.  The Minister will note that the motion calls for the establishment of a dedicated rural crime task force to ensure all relevant Departments co-ordinate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and address the specific challenges when dealing with rural crime, which is what is needed, namely, a co-ordinated effort.  <\/p><p>We call on the Government to conduct an immediate review of the operation of the bail laws, especially with respect to addressing provision of free legal aid to repeat offenders.  We have seen on episodes of &quot;Prime Time&quot; that 100-time repeat offenders receive free legal aid.  In deference to my good friend and colleague on my right, Deputy O'Callaghan, I note that the legal eagles have much to answer for.  They are on the gravy train of the system.  It is disgusting and it is not good enough that no one wants to halt this perverse, sickening state of affairs.  As the motion notes, the cost of criminal legal aid for every year covering the period 2011 to 2017 ranged from a staggering &euro;49 million to &euro;58 million.  My goodness, what would that not do for children's hospitals and the hospitals in Tipperary and elsewhere?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500046#TT00700","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1547586000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>And Kerry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500046#TT00800","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1547586000,"counter":519,"content":"<p>And Kerry, and all over the country.

We remain convinced, however, that there are simple things that can also be done in the immediate term to create a greater sense of protection for rural Ireland.  One of the most obvious is the need to increase Garda visibility in rural communities.  People want to see the local garda on patrol, not just for the protection of property against theft, but also for peace of mind on a day-to-day basis.  I salute the community police and local garda&iacute; in my area who do such a good job.  They need to have confidence and where that is not possible due to cuts or station closures, people feel increasingly isolated and vulnerable.  That is why we are also calling for a review of the trespass laws, aimed at strengthening the rights of farmers, homeowners, landowners and business people to protect their property and person.  <\/p>  <p>  Rural communities are very much open to active collaboration with the Garda and with the various agencies and Departments that can help in reducing the incidence of rural crime.  For this reason, we will push for a dedicated rural crime task force to be established on a permanent basis, where such collaboration can be targeted and focused to achieve the best possible outcomes.  We have seen with the community alert groups, the second of which was set up in my home village of Caisle&aacute;n Nua, and neighbourhood watch schemes that people are willing to support and help the Garda.  No police force can provide a policing service without the support of the people and that also applies here.<\/p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation was recently railroaded through the House by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, with the acquiescence of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who sat on their hands and did not vote against it.  The level of over-policing of that legislation is shocking and is doing untold damage to community support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local garda&iacute; who want to help and the traffic corps.  We want to support the Garda but the excessive number of checkpoints at which people are being stopped and breathalysed is ridiculous and is intimidating people going to and coming from work.  Some balance is needed because we need people to support the Garda.  Rural people are ready, willing and able to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They want to do so but we need balance.  We need community police in communities, going to meetings and giving them communities their time and energy.  We need more garda&iacute; on the beat.  We do not want to see these massive checkpoints, not to mention the &euro;100 million being spent on the contract for GoSafe vans.  This is a cash cow for the Department of Justice and Equality which will do nothing to solve crime or give confidence to people in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500047#UU00100","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1547586600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to introduce this motion with my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group.  I thank Triona and David in Deputy Mattie McGrath&rsquo;s office for their assistance in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Coming from a rural area in west Cork, I know only too well the fear and worry caused by rural crime in our communities, especially among isolated people living alone who may be elderly and vulnerable.  The prolonged closures of rural Garda stations are without doubt the biggest contributor to the fear that exists around this issue.  The role of garda&iacute; in rural Garda station is very important in crime prevention.  They work with local communities and community groups such as community alert in preventing crime and that role cannot be underestimated. <\/p>  <p>  In my constituency a number of Garda stations have been closed, including in Castletownsend, Ballygurteen, Goleen, Adrigole and Ballinspittle.  During the talks for Government, I and other independent rural Deputies highlighted the mistake made by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in closing rural Garda stations.  We were told by members of the previous Government that rural Garda stations were only bricks and mortar.  The politicians and decision makers were totally wrong.  They underestimated the harm they were about to do to rural Ireland.  During the talks for Government, it was agreed by the present Government to reopen a number of these Garda stations.  By agreeing to reopen Garda stations, mainly in rural Ireland, the Government acknowledged that wrong had been done.  <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Government has continued to make decisions that make life very difficult for people in rural Ireland.  I am not sure it understands rural isolation.  The previous Government definitely did not understand the fear that many people in rural Ireland lived under as a result of its policies.  I have seen at first hand the people of Ballinspittle working hard as a community to have their Garda station reopened.  In spite of promises to reopen the station, they are still waiting.  I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality many times in this Chamber to give the people of Ballinspittle an exact date for the reopening of the town's Garda station.  The people of Ballinspittle and west Cork deserve to know exactly when that Garda station will reopen.  I call again on the Minister to give a definite date for the reopening of Ballinspittle Garda station.  I would welcome him to west Cork.  Rather than going out to Stepaside to keep the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, happy, he should come to west Cork and keep us happy and safe.  We are sick and tired of promises with no delivery date.  I would appreciate if he was in a position to make an announcement on that matter this evening.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the individuals and community groups who volunteer their time to the task of community policing, a community orientated style of policing.  I am proud to have been involved in Schull community alert scheme for the past 25 years.  There is no doubt that community policing helps to tackle crime prevention, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life for the entire community.  I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality and Garda Commissioner to make a clear statement as to what community policing is because it remains unclear as to the boundaries of community policing.  The Garda Commissioner needs to work with people on the ground and be clear about the role of community policing.<\/p>  <p>  To tackle rural crime, more resources must be allocated to groups like Muintir na T&iacute;re.  Mr. Damian Cronin in west Cork is being stretched to the limit as he seeks to ease the minds of people in rural areas.  More funding is needed for community alert groups.  A scheme is needed to enable elderly people to apply for grants to pay for sensor lights and closed circuit television, CCTV, systems to protect their properties.  This scheme should be similar to the successful scheme providing the personal alarms that many elderly people wear around their necks or wrists and the text alert schemes.  Text alert was first suggested by a little group in Schull in west Cork.  At the time, we were treated as if we all had two heads, whereas everyone wants to run with the system now.  Under text alert, which is run by Muintir na T&iacute;re, communities are alerted to crime or suspicious activity in their neighbourhood.<\/p>  <p>  Immediate funding needs to be provided for the installation of CCTV systems in all our rural towns and villages.  CCTV is already in place in many towns, including Schull where I was involved in the community alert committee that had it installed.  Problems have arisen with CCTV being installed in Bandon.  This is a very serious issue for people in the town, many of whom have called me to see if we can push the scheme across the line.  Many towns in west Cork have CCTV systems in place and they have significantly reduced crime.  CCTV is a necessity in the towns and villages of west Cork.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda youth awards is a great initiative by the Garda for commending young people on their vigilance and the good they do in their communities.  I was honoured to be asked to attend the Garda youth awards last December in Castletownbere.  It was an uplifting experience to see how much great work the youth of our local communities are doing in their areas.  We need to acknowledge that 99% of our young people are good natured.<\/p>  <p>  We have a large number of community alert groups in west Cork which work closely with the Garda to prevent crime and discuss with the Garda all options for preventing crime.  Their work is invaluable.<\/p>  <p>  The Rural Independent Group has called for the establishment of a dedicated rural crime task force to ensure all relevant Departments co-ordinate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and address specific challenges when dealing with rural crime.  We also call on the Government to conduct an immediate review of the operation of the bail laws, specifically with respect to addressing the provision of free legal aid to repeat offenders time and again and identifying possible abuses of the legal aid scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The motion makes some specific long-term recommendations with respect to identifying and preventing rural crime and introducing greater fairness to the operation of the justice system.  We remain convinced, however, that there are simple things that can also be done in the immediate term to create a greater sense of protection in rural Ireland.  We have a saying that the man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away some small stones.  We are calling on the Government to introduce simple measures such as increasing Garda visibility in rural communities.  People want to see local garda&iacute; on patrol in the community, not just for the protection of property against theft but also for peace of mind on a day-to-day basis.<\/p>  <p>  On 20 December last, an awful crime in Bantry in my constituency left the local community in shock and afraid.  There is a great community alert group in Gortnacloona.  At 11.45 on the night in question, two armed men dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas entered a house.  The occupants of the house were present but thankfully no one was injured.  This was a deeply disturbing crime for the people involved and the local community.  It is natural that people feel increasingly violated and vulnerable in rural Ireland when crimes such as this happen. That is why the Rural Independent Group is also calling for a review of the trespass laws aimed at strengthening the rights of farmers, landowners and property owners to protect their property and person.<\/p>Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy Eoghan Murphy):<p>We know that rural communities are very much open to active collaboration with the Garda and with all the various agencies and Departments that can help in reducing the incidence of rural crime.  That is the reason the Rural Independent Group and I will be pushing for a dedicated rural crime task force to be established on a permanent basis where such collaboration can be targeted and focused to achieve the best possible outcomes.  It is vital that action is carried out to allow these groups put in place prevention measures and to stop rural crime altogether around west Cork and all over the country.<\/p> <p> The Garda Commissioner needs to explain how he sees the role of the Garda in our communities.  Are all the resources being spent on the traffic corps to try and clean up the mess created by the Minister, Deputy Ross?  That is how people see it.  We know the garda&iacute; work best with people in communities, nipping much crime in the bud, as they always did.  Community garda&iacute; encourage people to report crime carried out on their properties.  People now feel it is worthless to report crime and many are scared in case it will cause them more trouble as they do not have the same access to the Garda as they did in the past when garda&iacute; lived in the area.  It was important for people in the past that when the local garda&iacute; were appointed to an area they lived in the area.  It was a considerable boost to the community.  I could name numerous members of the force that are either retired or still active.  When they were on the beat little or no crime took place.  When they drove through the town they knew who should or who should not be in the town at any given time.  Rural community policing is gone and has been replaced in many cases with the traffic corps.  While those garda&iacute; are carrying out their duties they anger people instead of working with communities.  I am aware of some great community garda&iacute; such as Garda Jonathan McCarthy in Ballydehob.  He would see a needle out of place.  Garda John McCarthy in Kilbrittain is another great garda on the beat and Garda Eamonn White is another great community garda.  Those are the type of people the Garda needs to look at and to build a system around them if we want to have safe communities in the future as we had in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500047#UU00200","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547587200,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;

As a Minister who represents a large constituency, which is primarily rural in nature, I am most familiar with the concerns of people living in rural Ireland.  I know the impact that crime and the fear of crime can have on people.  However, I stress that crime is not a rural phenomenon and crime rates are much lower in rural areas.  The Government has decided to table an amendment for a number of reasons which I will outline in the course of my address.<\/p><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to highlight the scope of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's response to rural crime, which has been underpinned by the provision of significant and unprecedented resources in recent years.  However, I sincerely believe that all Deputies in this House are working towards a similar goal of achieving safer communities for all our citizens and I look forward to a constructive debate listening to the contributions of Members opposite.<\/p><p>As the House is aware, the Government is committed to ensuring a strong, visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement and to provide reassurance to citizens to deter crime.  The evidence of this commitment is not hard to find.  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014 almost 2,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they have been assigned to mainstream duties across the country.  This accelerated recruitment of garda&iacute; saw Garda numbers reach almost 14,000 by the end of last year, with Garda numbers expected to be in the region of 21,000 by 2021.  Furthermore, a total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year, an increase of over &euro;100 million on last year's allocation.  That investment will provide new and leading-edge technology to support front-line garda&iacute; in carrying out their work in both urban and rural communities.<\/p><p>The programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  As Minister for Justice and Equality I place significant focus on policing.  The Government recently approved my proposals on the implementation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The recommendations were made by a panel of experts after a number of consultations took place around the country, and beyond our shores.  The core focus is on a more visible Garda organisation working closely and collaboratively with communities and other agencies to keep communities safe and to prevent harm to vulnerable people.  The high level implementation plan was published before Christmas.  Among the recommendations to be taken forward this year is the revised local policing model which will provide more visible policing and the continued roll out of divisional protective services units which protect the most vulnerable in society.<\/p><p>As to the deployment Garda resources, including personnel, to specific areas, Members will appreciate that this is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  Late last year, the Commissioner announced that he will be seeking to recruit 600 additional garda&iacute; next year and he will redeploy 500 experienced officers to front-line duties.  The injection of that large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be most beneficial in terms of community safely.  As recognised in the motion, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responded to the type of threats that communities face through a robust and determined drive against criminals who seek to prey on vulnerable householders with the implementation of special operations such as Operation Thor.<\/p><p>On 20 December the CSO published the latest crime figures for quarter 3 of last year.  Regrettably, a rise in robberies was recorded, while there was a welcome decrease in burglary and theft-related offences which were down by 6.4% and 3.2%, respectively.  I am concerned about the rise in robbery.  That is an issue that is receiving the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I wish to refer to the ongoing commentary regarding the prevailing fear of crime in certain communities.  It is interesting to note that the latest public attitudes survey published by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for quarter 3 of 2018 indicates that 71% of people perceive national crime to be either a very serious or a serious problem.  However, only 18% of respondents considered crime in their local area to be a very serious or serious problem.  I do not wish to understate the concerns of individuals or communities with respect to the prevalence of crime.  Many possible factors generate a fear of crime which ought to be addressed but it is clear that there can be a disparity between the perception and the actual occurrence of crime.  In that context, I appeal to the Deputies opposite, in particular Deputy Mattie McGrath, and to commentators to be measured and factual in their comments on crime.<\/p><p>As part of a concerted strategy to combat burglary, the Government made it a priority to secure the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015.  These provisions are available to the Garda to support prosecutions arising from Operation Thor.  I know many Deputies have concerns regarding trespass in the criminal law.  I assure Members that all the legislative provisions on trespass remain under constant review.  I am advised that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act 1971 are robust.  I am happy to engage further with Deputies on these matters.<\/p><p>Another area of concern that has been mentioned is the operation of the bail laws.  The law was recently significantly strengthened by the Government.  The Criminal Justice Act 2017 expanded the factors a court may take into account when refusing bail.  These factors include previous convictions for serious offences that indicate persistent serious offending and the likelihood of any danger to a person or the community that the release of the accused on bail might cause.  The Act places greater emphasis on the rights and the safety of victims, and of the public, in bail decisions, while continuing to safeguard the rights of the accused.  The Act provides increased guidance for the courts and greater transparency in the bail process, including requiring judges to give reasons for granting or refusing bail.  While we must all remain vigilant in the fight against all forms of criminality and lawlessness in our communities, I assure Deputies that the Garda Commissioner and I remain in ongoing contact regarding countering new and emerging crime trends.  The ongoing recruitment and redeployment of garda&iacute;, our energetic and community-focused Garda Commissioner, the recent legislative improvements and the significant unprecedented budget of the order of &euro;1.7 billion allocated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should give confidence to Members of the House-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500048#VV00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1547587800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>They slashed overtime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500049#WW00100","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1547587800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>-----that everything possible is being done to fight crime in this country.

The reason we have 20 minutes is because the Fianna F&aacute;il Whip's office was inundated with Deputies from my party who wanted to speak on this motion.  These are Deputies who want to speak in a measured and factual way, to quote the Minister's language.  The reason they want to speak is because rural crime is such an issue in their constituencies.  It is not some fictitious issue that has been raised in this House by the Rural Independent Group.<\/p>  <p>  It will come as no surprise to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and other Members to learn that Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the motion.  The reason it will not come as a surprise is that 13 months ago, we put forward a motion on rural crime that dealt with many of the issues that are identified in the motion before the House.  The reason that motion was put forward some 13 months ago was because of the continuing concern of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies, not just in rural areas but also in urban areas, about the issue of crime in our community.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear about what was debated 13 months ago and what we believe to be the issue 13 months later, as we discuss it this evening.  The most important requirement for Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and members of the community is greater visibility of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their communities and constituencies.  That adds to the confidence local people have in the Garda force that protects them and gives them a sense that work is actively being done on the ground to ensure crime is tackled.  I note that in the city of Dublin, such visibility has improved in recent times and anyone travelling around Dublin will say they notice more garda&iacute; out on the street and on the beat.  I will be interested to hear what my colleagues from rural constituencies have to say on whether that is replicated in rural areas.  Obviously, it is also important that if there are more garda&iacute; out on the streets, they are not simply being used for the very important issue of detection of road traffic offences.  They must also be there to deal with the other forms of criminal behaviour that take place in our constituencies.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at what else was discussed in the debate some 13 months ago.  One of the issues we raised was that of technology.  It is still the case that the CCTV scheme that was rolled out many years ago by the Government is being under-utilised, in particular because the scheme is too difficult for local communities to operate and implement.  The Minister and the Government need to be much more proactive about ensuring local communities and the community in general have the benefit of CCTV.  We know from areas where it is used that it acts as a very real deterrent to crime.  The Minister must take greater responsibility in this respect, as must the Government, to ensure that local communities both know it is available and how they can use it.<\/p>  <p>  On the last occasion, some 13 months ago, I also raised the issue of our bail laws and how they need to be strengthened.  Fianna F&aacute;il acted on this issue.  We introduced legislation that got through Second Stage and which sought to make our bail laws stronger so there would be a presumption that a person convicted of a serious offence in the five years previous to when he or she applied for bail would not get it.  Although we managed to get it through the House on Second Stage, we were opposed by the Government and we were also opposed by the Government on Committee Stage.  Unfortunately, given the reality of the numbers in the House, we are not going to get that through.  However, the Minister and the Government need to recognise we have a problem with our bail laws and it is not some fiction that is created by politicians.<\/p>  <p>  I will hand over to my colleagues from rural constituencies to let them speak.  We will be supporting the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500049#WW00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1547587800,"counter":536,"content":"<p>It is important that we take the chance to debate this, particularly at this time of year, when people's genuine fears about crime are accentuated because of the darkness.  I thank the Rural Independent Group for giving us this chance.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan referred to a number of the issues.  First, I acknowledge the service that every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na gives.  We often take them for granted and we need to remember that many have lost their lives in the pursuit of that service and in minding and protecting our communities.  We also need to look at what we need to do to assist them.  I agree with my colleagues in regard to visibility.  In urban towns, including my own, there is much higher visibility than there has been in some time.  While the implementation of the community garda system has been hugely significant and beneficial, we also need to see it operating on a rural basis, with community garda&iacute; assisting communities on day-to-day issues.  As well as visibility, there needs to be availability of garda&iacute; to do the basic jobs, such as dealing with passports, gun licences and so on.  When somebody calls to a station, a garda should be there to carry out that service, as well as being present at the station for other reasons.  As one of people's biggest frustrations concerns this engagement on the basic jobs that need to be done, there must be some sort of reform of the system.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the Minister needs to look again at the issue of CCTV with a view to making the scheme much more user-friendly.  This is particularly the case given the Government is about to roll out a national broadband scheme.  Surely this is the opportunity to tie those two projects together and ensure that, as we roll out the national broadband scheme, the technology is linked into communities across the country, enabling them to manage community CCTV.  The Government must ensure money is available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is taking over the data-sharing responsibilities from local authorities, and must also ensure it is available for CCTV systems.  We are great at putting in these things but not so great at looking after them.  Unless they are maintained, they are not effective.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of drugs is no longer exclusive to cities or to large urban towns; it is an issue that has been hitting every single rural community.  There is a genuine fear among parents and communities about the impact of this and it has to be faced up to.  It is necessary to upskill garda&iacute; and local people with regard to their knowledge and to give the resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with this in the manner in which it needs to be dealt with.  Unfortunately, it is no longer the preserve of urban areas and is now an all-island problem that needs to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  The neighbourhood watch scheme is still relevant and important.  It needs commitment from the Ministers, Deputies Flanagan and Ring, to re-energise it as a community response.<\/p>  <p>  The relationship between local garda&iacute; and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in communities is key to this area.  That relationship needs to be tended and invested in.  It is fragile, and is particularly fragile at the moment in many communities.  Senior Garda management, who may not be on the ground, need to bear that in mind for the sake of their mission and that of the members of the force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500049#WW00500","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1547587800,"counter":537,"content":"<p>As our spokesperson on justice said, we will be supporting this motion.  There will be a lot of repetition by rural Deputies because the problems are common across all of our constituencies.  The first point I want to make is about trespass laws and the legitimate concerns of landowners and businesses which cannot avail of the criminal law to force trespassers off their property.  This is a serious issue in rural Ireland.  Gangs are going around the country under the mask of hunting but the law does not allow the landowners to report that as a criminal offence.  It is seen as a civil wrong, and this needs to be corrected in legislation.  Trespass must be seen as a criminal offence.  It needs to be stamped out in rural areas and trespass laws need to change.<\/p><p> The other aspect is legal aid and frequent access to it.  In the last eight years &euro;430 million has been spent on free legal aid which can be sought orally without any documentation to verify the financial circumstances of the accused.  Citizens against whom criminal acts are being perpetrated, one of whom was on local radio this morning to discuss their property being broken into for the seventh time, see the person accused accessing legal aid on an ongoing basis, which is extremely frustrating and disheartening.<\/p> <p> I also raise with the Minister the issue of manpower in Garda stations.  In one Garda station in County Tipperary there are ten garda&iacute; out of work owing to injury as a result of assaults or stress, maternity leave or other unpaid leave.  The shortfall is not being made up by the Commissioner and stations are short-handed.  This is extremely bad for the morale of garda&iacute; and leaves the sergeants in charge unable to police their areas properly.  With the ongoing ban on overtime, this puts garda&iacute; on the ground in an impossible position.  <\/p> <p> I could make many more points than those three to the Minister, but I must give my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues an opportunity to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500049#WW00600","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547588400,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Living in a safe and secure house in a safe and secure community is incredibly important to each of us and our constituents.  Sadly, however, many people do not believe they live in a safe and secure house in a safe and secure community.  Many are being terrorised by rural crime in their communities.  While many may consider Kildare to be an urban area, almost 50% of the county is rural.   Owing to the presence of motorways, there is a huge level of rural crime.  I heard only at the weekend of a farmer in south Kildare who was terrorised by six men with dogs who arrived on the pretence that they were hunting.  I have no doubt that they were stalking the land.  There appears to be some correlation throughout the country, in particular in counties close to Dublin which contain rural areas, between people coming to hunt and stalk and robberies happening at a later stage.  The particular individual in question had the presence of mind to send a text immediately to the local text alert service.  I compliment the communities involved in it.  They are doing a fantastic job.  Within ten minutes ten members of the local community attended, not to take the law into their own hands but to show solidarity to the person being victimised.  That is just one example.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a failure on the part of the Government.  The Minister said rural crime statistics were down, but they certainly are not.  The Government closed 139 Garda barracks in rural Ireland.  The barracks and local garda were the nerve centre of an area and had a lot of local knowledge and so could prevent crime, but that has been taken out of the equation.  We need to increase the number of garda&iacute; on the ground in rural communities.  We need to establish a rural crime task force.  We also need to increase funding for Garda supported CCTV and strengthen the bail laws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500050#XX00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1547588400,"counter":540,"content":"<p>The group has lost time and will have to decide how to allocate what is left among themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500050#XX00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1547588400,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion on rural crime.

In this case, it is the recent good work in opening the new Garda station in County Galway.  I acknowledge also that before Christmas, Galway was one of the fortunate areas to be selected for inclusion in the pilot scheme on domestic violence.  As a member of the joint policing committee, I welcome this.  However, I reflect on the time 17 months ago when I spoke in the House about the bridge crossings over the River Shannon.  Coming from Portumna, I live on the banks of the river and spoke about the crossings at Portumna and Banagher and the need to install Garda CCTV systems to provide for number plate recognition.  It would help a great deal to prevent raids by larger gangs who enter Galway via one bridge and leave by the other.  If we had CCTV cameras, it would be fantastic.  There are fantastic dog kennels at the new Garda station and I would love to see drug dogs in Galway.  Currently, we have to apply to Cork or Limerick to borrow a dog for drug raids.

While it was passed by the House, unfortunately, little has changed.  As such, I wish the Independent Alliance better luck than we had.  <\/p>  <p>  Many of us have stood up in the Chamber time after time to highlight the decimation of rural Ireland.  The social aspect of rural living has been eroded in many places and, unfortunately, replaced with fear.  This is due in part to the closure of 139 Garda stations and a lack of resources which have left the countryside wide open to criminal activity.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister for an update on the reopening of the Garda station in Ballinspittle.  It has been promised for a while by the Minister and I ask him to provide a date for its reopening.  <\/p>  <p>  Local communities are so disheartened they have set up their own anti-crime community groups.  My colleagues have highlighted many aspects the of rural crime problem.  In my short slot I will focus on CCTV systems giving an example of the disparity facing towns and villages in my constituency of Cork South West.  There were attempts to break into many properties on an estate in Dunmanway on Saturday night last at 4 a.m.  If two men returning from work had not entered the estate and disrupted four criminals, many houses would have been burgled and many cars stolen.  Having spoken to garda&iacute; who checked the CCTV footage, the car used in the criminal act was identified.  That is how the system should work.  However, many other towns and villages, including Bandon, my home town, have been waiting for years for the provision of CCTV systems.  What is more annoying is the fact that only &euro;430,000 of the &euro;2 million allocated has been spent on CCTV systems to date.  In Cork South West 27 applications have been submitted, of which seven have yet to be given the go-ahead.  Will the Minister advise why there is a hold up?  Surely, there is an allocation of funds such that all applications should be sanctioned.  Rural Ireland is being destroyed at a social level and people must now be content with basic safety.  They deserve to feel comfortable and safe in their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500050#XX00500","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1547588400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I compliment the Independent Alliance on moving the motion and commend the support groups, including Community Alert, Muintir na T&iacute;re, and farm and community groups that are making, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the best efforts on behalf of communities.  However, the problem remains urban and rural isolation.  People are living in terror and fear, including fear of gangs and often of drug-fuelled repeat offenders.  Last year garda&iacute; in the Louth Garda division had to deal with five murders, in addition to two ongoing murder investigations.  Three of those charged with three of the five murders were on bail and that is not to mention the well known drug feud in Drogheda, of which the Minister is well aware.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not want to delay the debate other than to say I support many of the suggestions made.  I will not go into the issue of CCTV systems, as I could talk about it for a week.  Instead I will provide some thoughts for the Minister's consideration on the practicalities of dealing with the surge in crime across communities.<\/p><p>I might not be supported in suggesting that we should consider extending the option of voluntary deferment of retirement to garda&iacute; who wish to continue to serve in the force.  Perhaps that option could be made available until we have reached the required recruitment levels.  Such a measure would allow the Garda to keep the experience that is needed.  I also suggest that we should set up a lo-call community alert number on a regional basis, and on a cross-Border basis around the Border, so that people can call a very recognisable number to make contact with monitored answering systems within their regions.  That raises the whole issue of regional crime, to which others have referred.<\/p> <p> There should be no bail for repeat offenders.  There should be electronic tagging, especially of those who are involved in gun crime.  There should be zero tolerance of the use of all offensive weapons.  I have looked at the statistics for repeat offenders for the years between 2013 and 2017.  Sex offences increased by 33% during that time.  Robbery, hijacking and extortion increased by 20%.  Thefts increased by 75%.  Other offences against the State and the Government doubled.<\/p> <p> The authorities in County Louth have been looking at the very successful Theft Stop scheme, which has been in operation in the Monaghan region.  Individuals and communities should be proactively encouraged to avail of this scheme, which involves the marking of vehicles and equipment.

That debate took place in the context of some particularly horrific and violent attacks.  I know that for many people, those attacks have left psychological scars in the communities where they happened.  People in many communities remain deeply concerned about their safety in their own homes.  This issue has yet to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  All the evidence and anecdotal experience shows it is undoubtedly the case that visible policing is the best deterrent to crime.  While Sinn F&eacute;in appreciates that there are other deterrents, we have put police visibility at the heart of our proposals in this area.  I have said time and again that there has been a significant reduction in Garda visibility over recent years.  A few Deputies, including the Minister, have said they believe there has been an increase in Garda visibility more recently.  I have to say I am not convinced.  I am aware that some of these discussions are focused on Dublin.  It has not been my experience and I am not sure it has been the experience in every constituency.  I think there has been an increase in Garda visibility in areas proximate to district headquarters in some specified ways.  However, many Garda stations are still at or below 2010 levels.  That is why so many stations were reliant on overtime.  Many stations in Dublin and other areas are running to stand still.  There is a need to address the serious reduction in community garda&iacute; since 2010.  The number of community garda&iacute; in many areas has decreased by 75%.  There is a serious need to address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of community CCTV schemes has been raised time and again.  It is clear that the current system is not working.  Many applications have been made but have not been processed.  The CCTV system in Carrigaline, which is in my constituency, is not working at present.  There is a need for joint policing committees to have more power to allow priorities to be set at local level.<\/p>  <p>  Changes in bail legislation are not necessarily required.  I suggest that better monitoring of bail is needed.  I have often instanced the case of Shane O'Farrell.  It is one of many cases in which repeated clear breaches of bail conditions were not followed up or enforced.  We need better enforcement of bail, especially in rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that crime increased last year, by comparison with 2017, in a number of significant areas, including robberies.  In the first nine months of 2018, there were 655 burglaries and 339 vehicle thefts in Cork.  Before Christmas, I raised with the Minister my concerns about the ban on Garda overtime.  I would be very interested to see the crime statistics for the fourth quarter of 2018.  It seems from my anecdotal experience that there was a very significant increase in a wide variety of crimes, particularly property crimes like burglaries and thefts, in the last three months of the year.<\/p>  <p>  I am not just talking about rural areas in this context.  There have been significant numbers of burglaries and robberies in Togher, Lehenaghmore and Glanmire.  The Carrigaline area, in particular, was hammered over the Christmas period.  Hardly a day went by without a new report of people snooping around cars.  The town was hammered.  In some instances, people who rang in were told that the squad car was out on an emergency call and no other car was available.  That is not the fault of garda&iacute;.  It is a resourcing issue.  Carrigaline is a very significant town, but it is clearly under-resourced in policing terms.  The CCTV scheme clearly needs to be addressed as well.  That scheme needs to be approved.  Major towns like Carrigaline need better Garda resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500051#YY00400","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1547589000,"counter":548,"content":"<p>In supporting this Private Members' motion, which has been proposed by the Rural Independent Group, I am conscious that some rural dwellers have been subjected to the most brutal treatment by people who have violated their homes and their properties.  While all of that is terrible, I expect that the predominant thought in all our minds this evening is the fear such incidents have given rise to.  Rural Ireland is afraid.  A real and tangible fear has gripped rural Irish society and whole communities across every county in Ireland, North and South.  Robberies, coupled with blatant thuggery, have been taking place with limited detection and prosecution of those involved.  Although senior garda&iacute; claim there has been a reduction in home burglaries across rural Ireland, it is clear that isolated homes and farm machinery remain on the target lists of reprehensible individuals.<\/p>  <p>  During the Christmas recess, I called on and spoke to many people I know in my constituency who are fearful for their safety.  They are living alone and are no longer as agile as they once were.  They are maintaining a stressful lifestyle because they are on constant alert as they listen, watch and, worst of all, expect the worst.  This is no way to live.  It is harmful for everyone who is affected by it.  Further charges and consecutive sentences should be applied to those who are apprehended for burglaries and farmyard thefts.  Engendering fear should attract a further penalty for those involved.<\/p>  <p>  The motion we are debating calls on the Government to \"establish a rural crime taskforce\", to \"conduct an immediate review of the operation\" of relevant legislation, to \"conduct a review of the trespass laws\", to increase \"the funding available for ... local Text Alert and Business Watch schemes\", to further \"initiatives like Operation Thor\" and to reopen some strategically located rural Garda stations.  The motion also calls for more funding for Garda overtime.  In tandem with that, I suggest that more funding for more garda&iacute; might be a better answer.<\/p>  <p>  Citizens and communities deserve peace of mind.  People in rural Ireland need to feel safe again.  The steps commended in the motion before the House merit the serious address of the Minister, his Cabinet colleagues and the Garda Commissioner.  Trust and security must be restored to everyone who lives in rural Ireland and indeed in every community in the land.

Some of the proposals in the motion such as the establishment of a taskforce and a review of trespass laws are good idea.  We need to move forward with those.  The recommendations of Kathleen O'Toole's report included much of what many people have said about ensuring there are garda&iacute; in local areas.  Strategically, the Garda stations that are going to be open and the ones that are not need to be nailed down sooner rather than later.  Communities in some places are also willing to do work.  More Garda patrol cars can be seen in rural areas during the day.  It could be debated whether they are out on checkpoint duty in the morning time.  However, between the hours of 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. when much of the rural crime happens, there does not seem to be as big a Garda presence on patrol.  Many communities are willing to help work on the CCTV issue.  It is a cumbersome task, with many obstacles that have to be overcome and, basically, they struggle.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding legal aid, I recall during the talks on Government formation it was stated that if we were to remove legal advice that under an United Nations measure we could be in trouble in terms of the challenge of a legal case.

I want to speak briefly on the report on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Inherent in it are some very valuable recommendations, which would very much tally with the methodology set out and the motion that is before us.There are 50 recommendations in the report and I will refer to a few of them.  These recommendations are eminently sensible and predicated on a wide consultation whereby those involved in the report went out into the communities.<\/p><p>Recommendation 22 states: <\/p><blockquote>The building of genuine community partnerships should be a requirement for all Garda districts.  Garda&iacute; should be assessed for their performance in this respect, and it should be a factor in determining assignments and promotions.  <\/blockquote><p>It also refers to district policing plans.  <\/p><p>Recommendation 26 refers to the redeployment of experienced garda&iacute; currently employed in other duties.  It states: <\/p><blockquote>Job specifications should be developed for all positions in the police service, clearly indicating the skills and expertise required and whether police powers are necessary for the job or not.  If not, the presumption should be that a non-sworn person should occupy the position. <\/blockquote><p>Regarding the number of garda&iacute; in rural Ireland and across urban Ireland, there is a clear view in the report that perhaps too many garda&iacute; are involved in administrative duties, some of necessity, but that if there is scope to redeploy people to the front line, that should be accelerated in a timely fashion.<\/p><p>Recommendation 40 states:<\/p><blockquote>District police should be in close communication with their communities.<br \/><br \/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should produce regular, and eventually real-time, open data feeds to the public.<br \/><br \/>Public apps should be developed at the community level to enable residents to report their concerns, and police to disseminate the information about matters of interest from crime prevention to road closures.  <br \/><br \/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should develop and implement a new social media strategy.  In all districts the police should use social media and other technology tools to engage with the local community.<\/blockquote><p>If we can start the work of bringing to fruition these recommendations, that will have a great impact.  If we can deploy these resources at the district level in a way that allows the community to communicate directly, using the new technologies that are available, with the garda&iacute;, that will provide real-time information and that should give rise to a real-time response.  There is still a lag time in many districts and the evidence of that is clear.  If there is a genuine willingness to implement these recommendations, that will have a bearing on some of the issues, particularly for rural areas.  Chapter 6 of the report on the Future of Policing in Ireland is quite stark.  It refers to the recording of crime statistics.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>it is hard to say with confidence what the level of crime is.  But we encountered concerns about crime wherever we travelled in our consultations around the country, both in urban and rural areas.  Fear of crime, which is often greater than the reality of crime, is also a serious matter in itself, badly affecting quality of life.  We have found many examples in our public consultations of communities and individuals living with an unsettling level of fear of crime.<\/blockquote><p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to this issue in his contribution.  There are specific recommendations regarding greater police visibility, engagement and accessibility and that this would help address that fear of crime.  It would be helpful if we, collectively, as an Oireachtas can work on those issues and if we could instill confidence in the community.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to this issue as well and mentioned poor Shane O'Farrell whose family still has not received justice.  Until such time as they - to name one family among thousands of people who have been the victims of crime - receive justice, we will continue to have a lag in terms of confidence.  Furthermore, until such time as we accelerate the recommendations and principles in the report on the Future of Policing in Ireland, I fear the lack of confidence in some parts of the country will continue to be an issue.  <\/p><p>We have an opportunity to address that.  We have the tools of the trade to seek to resolve the very many issues brought before us in this motion.  We must ensure the resources are deployed in a smart way to ensure people, particularly in rural areas,  have confidence that when they report an incident it is responded to in a timely fashion and that justice is done in a timely fashion.  We must also ensure he preventative element of criminality is such that if the resources are deployed in a smart way, employing the technologies, that we can do much to prevent the crimes against people we are articulating and that are espoused in this motion.  <\/p><p>I, too, would like to raise the issue of clarity regarding CCTV.  We know that there are issues regarding the GDPR and whether citizens going about their daily business have certain entitlements to the right to privacy.  We need to overcome that challenge because there must be a balance between protecting our communities, ensuring there is proper surveillance and ensuring the balance of rights for individuals who are going about their  daily business in an honest fashion.  If we were to poll people throughout the country, I believe the vast majority of them would want to have a public infrastructure that involves some degree of surveillance of sensitive areas throughout our towns and villages and within rural communities.<\/p><p>The vast majority of people would want a public infrastructure that involves some degree of surveillance of sensitive areas throughout our towns and villages and within rural communities.  We support the motion.  On the issue of bail in respect of the Criminal Justice Act, we have to be mindful, notwithstanding the fact that we are supporting the motion, of its constitutionality.  To be fair to the proposers of the motion, they are seeking to reduce the level of recidivism and that should be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547590200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>We support the motion.  I thank its proposers for tabling it.  The issue of rural crime affects people in practically every part of Ireland because Ireland is largely a rural country.  In many of our towns and villages, even reasonably-sized towns, we have issues with crime, especially with burglary.  That affects many people living in rural areas in a very negative way.  When a house is burgled in one part of a parish, it creates serious fear, particularly among older people, everywhere in that parish.  I have experienced it in my parish as I am sure nearly everyone who lives in rural Ireland has.  This motion suggests that we need a task force on crime to bring all the elements together to look at this issue.  That is a very good idea.  We need to recognise that it is not only the garda&iacute; that will have to respond to this.  Communities across the country have found that, while things have improved somewhat in recent times, they have in the past had to step up to the mark, form text alert services and community alerts, trying to do something to protect themselves and their community.<\/p>  <p>  The bail law has a significant impact on this issue.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, in many cases the people that engage in some of these crimes are already on bail, sometimes several times.  It is not so much about the law as the implementation of it and what is going on in our court system.  We need to get a grip on this, particularly with the kind of crime that most people are most fearful of when living in rural areas, where one is talking about somebody breaking into an old person's house and robbing him or her or stealing machinery.  In many cases, when the culprits are caught, we find that they are repeat offenders and that they have been on bail several times while they carried out other crimes.  The issue of additional funding, particularly for text alert and other schemes, really needs to be looked at.  It has a significant positive impact on the community because it means that people in the community feel that they can respond themselves.  It gives them confidence in themselves and in their area.<\/p>  <p>  In most parts of rural Ireland, thankfully, crime rates have been very low and they have been very safe places to live.  We want to send that message that it is a safe place to live.  It is a safe place for people to settle and live in in general.  It is because it has traditionally been so safe that when these things happen, people's fear is raised to such a high level.  We need to make sure that we continue to ensure that these are safe places for people to live and operate.  Small businesses are particularly impacted by crime.  I was speaking to a person in business recently, in a small local town.  He tells me that he cannot count the number of times his shop has been robbed over the years.  Shoplifting is a serious problem.  Some people who he knows do it all the time yet he is fearful to approach them.  There is an element of intimidation in some of the gangs carrying out these kinds of operations.  In many cases, for whatever reason, the local community, especially businesspeople, feels that the garda&iacute; are not acting strongly and forcefully enough and doing enough to prevent this kind of crime from happening.<\/p>  <p>  We absolutely support the essence of the motion.  It is unfortunate that the Government has chosen to table an amendment to this motion to try to water it down.  The amendment is basically saying that we are doing a great job and that everything is hunky-dory.  I am sure all of the backbenchers in Fine Gael know that is not the view of people on the ground.  There are problems and the Minister and Government need to face up to them and put the investment in place in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to resolve them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500053#AAA00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1547590200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>The most recent report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, entitled Policing with Local Communities, made for some very interesting reading.  Its recommendations only support what others have said here tonight.  Some of these recommendations mirror the concerns of the general public.  Under the heading &quot;Rural Crime and the Fear of Crime&quot;, it states:<\/p><blockquote>During this inspection, a number of local people and organisations representing communities raised the issue of rural crime and the high fear of crime experienced by some people.  Geography and rural isolation present challenges for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of visibility and providing reassurance.  Additionally some rural areas have experienced the closure of local stations and seen reductions in the number of community policing garda&iacute;.  Recognising the concerns about crime in rural communities, the Inspectorate believes that a multi-agency rural crime prevention and reassurance partnership should be developed to tackle crime and the fear of crime in rural communities.<\/blockquote><p>The report raises the issue of visibility.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The Garda Public Attitudes Survey measures visibility and in 2017 only 36% of adults reported that garda&iacute; patrolled their area regularly (98% of which was in cars).  Awareness of garda&iacute; patrolling on foot was 12% and on bicycles 5%.<\/blockquote><p>The report goes on to state, as previously advised by the Minister, that budgetary constraints from 2018 to 2021 will significantly impact the delivery of the Garda building and refurbishment programme from 2016 to 2022 and subsequently the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the Garda modernisation and renewal programme.<\/p><p>The Minister says the Garda report is contradictory to what he is saying.  On the issue of the Garda fleet, 2,771 modes of transport are registered but over 1,076 are six years or more old as of 31 July 2018.  Garda management in County Cork says that crime rates are increasing.  In a report made to Cork County Council's joint policing committee on Monday 23 October, Garda commissioners from all three policing divisions said that they have recorded 1,734 incidents of property crime between July and September compared with 1,345 cases for the same period last year.  Crimes against persons have also increased, from 489 to 622, with incidents of burglaries increasing from 163 to 269 when compared with 2016 figures.  Despite the best efforts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, crime is on the rise, and if we do not support the garda&iacute;, we will lose the battle against crime.  The Minister of State is well aware that we had two serious cases over the Christmas period in Midleton and I wish those two victims a very speedy recovery.  I urge the Government to withdraw its amendment and support garda&iacute; and the Rural Independent Group on tonight's motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500053#AAA00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1547590200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the broad thrust of this motion tabled by the Rural Independent Group.  We tabled a similar motion to address rural crime in November 2017 which was passed by this House.  In preparation for tonight's speech, I went back and read over what I said that night.  It is unfortunate that I am back over a year later raising the same issue, as little has changed since.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak on a specific type of crime prevention, CCTV, which has been spoken about by nearly every speaker tonight.  An extract from the 2016 programme for Government reads: \"We will support investment in CCTV at key locations along the road network and in urban centres.\"  Every time I raise this issue with a Minister and other members of the Government, they deflect to the community-based CCTV grant-aided scheme.  This is not what I refer to.  I refer to the failure by the Government to honour its commitment to erect CCTV cameras at key locations on our motorways, which are being used by criminal gangs to access and escape the communities they are terrorising.  Will the Minister of State clarify at which key locations along the road network CCTV has been erected to combat rural crime, or his plans to erect it in the near future?  As far as I know, there is very little coming off the motorways.  Two motorways go through my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, the M9 and M7.  Organised gangs are targeting businesses, robbing them and using the motorway to aid their escape.<\/p><p>Billions of euro of taxpayers' money have been spent on upgrading our motorways over recent decades, and the advantages of this investment speak for themselves, but we must do more to police our national primary routes effectively.<\/p> <p> Referring back to the community-based CCTV grant-aided scheme, I am receiving complaints about the cumbersome application process from individual communities around the country, in particular those in my area.  I accept that taxpayers' money must be put to good use and due diligence must be applied to the application to ensure that CCTV systems are effective, but there must be some way of streamlining the system.  I know of one text alert group in my constituency that is seeking clarification from the local authority and the Garda as to who will have responsibility for monitoring the footage.  The local authority continues to state that it awaits advice on data protection legislation, and this has been ongoing for some time.  The community is setting it up and getting funding from the Department, yet no one is taking responsibility because of data protection legislation.  This needs to be clarified in order that these schemes can be put in place.  This would at least be of help in crime prevention.  Perhaps the Minister of State could indicate where the responsibility lies.  Approximately &euro;17,000 has been collected by the people of the community I speak of, and the CCTV is badly needed.  Can this be clarified?  Who will take responsibility?  Will it be the local Garda station?  Who, where and how?<\/p> <p> I also wish to say a little about bail laws.  We all know about people out on bail who commit crimes and then come before the courts.  Not alone have they one, two, three or four convictions.  We all know of terrible cases in which they have 40 or 50 cases against them and they are out on bail.  These people do not mind the recording of another offence against them.  It means nothing to them.  Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward legislation in the D&aacute;il and in our manifesto during the previous general election proposing that second and third offenders would not get free legal aid or, if they did, would only get it on a limited basis.  These people do not care.  They are free to commit more crime, more robberies - it is usually robberies - and what difference does another one or two convictions make when added to the five, six or 20 they have already?  I ask the Minister of State to look at our bail laws and do something about people who commit crime consistently.  They should be kept either in jail or under a curfew such that they cannot go out and create havoc in our communities, in particular in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500053#AAA00400","speaker":"1368","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547590800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I am thankful for this opportunity and I thank the Rural Independent Group for using its time for this important issue.  I join others in commending our garda&iacute; in communities throughout the country on the hard work they do on their behalf.  That said, through no fault of their own, we can provide a template such that they can be even more effective.  Consecutive Governments over the years, not just the Minister of State's own but indeed those of our party, have undermined the viability of rural Ireland.  This has increased the vulnerability of rural communities to be victims of crime.  We have stripped out Garda stations - Fine Gael being responsible for 139 of them in 2012 and 2013 alone - and many post offices, which is still ongoing.  This in turn has led to closures of other businesses and increased the vulnerability of villages that no longer support family businesses, and it is for city-based crime gangs to prey on these villages.  This is something we need to reverse and look at closely when we look at the overheating nature of capacity here in Dublin city and in our other cities.  We would do better to think a little more strategically about this.<\/p>  <p>  Community policing is where all the success has been in larger urban areas of the future, but we have moved away from it in rural areas where, historically, in any rural area - Easky or Cliffony, County Sligo, for example - the local garda and the local sergeant lived in the community.  This is now a rare occurrence.  Normally, garda&iacute; can now live 20, 30, 40 or 50 miles away.  They do not have the level of local knowledge that their predecessors of some decades ago had.  The garda&iacute; of those days knew where every body was buried, where every stone was to be unturned and what was going on.  We should, if necessary, incentivise local garda&iacute; to live in rural communities.  I appreciate that a guy from a particular street in the city cannot be a garda in that area, but it is something we could usefully look at.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding not just bail but also reoffending, we have heard the statistics.  In 2016, the rate of crimes committed by people on bail rose to 13%.  We also have a huge number of reoffenders, whether in burglary, aggravated assault or drugs.  Drugs are in every community in Ireland.  It does not matter how rural they are, unfortunately.  These are the issues.  We need to look at our whole system of incarceration because, sadly, it is foundering in terms of its rehabilitative focus.  Sadly, people in high percentages of cases are honing their skills while they are guests of the State, coming out to reoffend, perhaps learning an extra trick or two from colleagues in the prison system.  We need to look at rehabilitation in order that we weed out the potential for reoccurrences.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Aylward, has rightly pointed to CCTV.  It is one thing to announce &euro;1 million per year for a scheme, but if the scheme is unworkable and overly bureaucratic or we put so many obstacles in the way, as is the case, the money will not be spent.  Of the &euro;2 million allocated so far, only about &euro;430,000 has been drawn down.  Local authorities have to be data controllers.  Local authorities such as Sligo, for example, do not have a red cent to support their normal services.  Therefore, despite the fact that the communities may want the local authorities to expand to other areas, they cannot support the costs that are necessary to back up these applications and be the data controller.  I ask that the network of community councils throughout the country be looked at as the applicant or the conduit for data controlling, which may help in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500054#BBB00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1547590800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to talk on this very important motion.  It is important for people living in rural areas and perhaps not so rural places, as Deputy MacSharry said in his speech.  It is a fact that garda&iacute; were very effective when they lived in the local community.  In many instances a house was provided locally for the sergeant to live in.  There was one in Kilgarvan until very recent times, and then even that was sold along with the Garda station.  Going back even a generation, the garda&iacute; helped people when pressure was on them to save hay or turf.  In their time off they helped widows or people like my grandmother, whose husband was disabled, to save turf and even bring out the turf.  They accrued an awful lot of local knowledge and valuable information by visiting people, perhaps sick people or whoever else, and having the cup of tea and wandering around from place to place.  There was not a thing they did not know or understand about that happened in their parish.<\/p>  <p>  Rural places are now very lonely and desolate at night, however, as a result of the laws that were recently passed here.  I am sad to say that some of the parties here abstained on and more of them voted for the Bill in the name of the Minister, Deputy Ross.  This has meant that roads from rural places are now desolate from 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and open to criminals, vandals, thieves and robbers.  Before if there was a fellow going for the pint or two, he would see something or someone.  Now there is no one out because they are afraid to go out.  They are like rabbits in a burrow, barely peeping out now and then because they are afraid of being popped, as it were, if they go out.  It is a waste of Garda resources.<\/p>  <p>  I challenged the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality a few weeks ago as to why they were directing the garda&iacute; in this regard.  It is across all divisions.  That day I asked why people were being checked going to mass.  They are being checked coming out of mass now.  That is the truth.  It has happened.  People who have never drunk have been checked and are angry about this.  Even mothers going to school with children in the morning are being stopped.  People generally are so angry all across my constituency about what has happened.  It is unnecessary and wrong.<\/p><p>It has changed rural Ireland forever because they do not have the transport in the morning or at night that there is in urban places such as Dublin.  Our Garda chief superintendent, Tom Myers, said there are drugs in every town and village in Kerry.  Does that have anything to do with the fact that the Garda stations in Lauragh and Sneem are being closed and there are vast stretches of our coastline along the Kenmare River that are open to the bringing of drugs into our county?  Maybe there should be more emphasis on that because it is sad to see mothers and fathers bringing up their children, doing everything they can for them, sending them to college and then too many of them get drugs, which are too easily available.  We should and could do more to prohibit and prevent that serious scenario that is taking place. <\/p> <p> There is constant fear and concern about the threat of criminal activity emerging as a persistent feature of rural life.  There is significant under-reporting of rural crime and growing amounts of farm machinery, diesel and heating oil are being stolen.  It is impossible to take care of an oil tank.  They are being hit by these people, more often than not, who take the heating oil people so badly need.  <\/p> <p> The cost of legal aid in the past six or seven years ranged from &euro;49 million to &euro;58 million.  It is sad to think that the same villains who get legal aid in one, two or three instances get it if they have 40 instances, and in many cases they do.  The Minister of State should examine this and the bail laws for people who commit crime and are out on bail waiting for court hearings who think nothing of carrying out another atrocious crime.  The statistics show that they carry out most crimes as they are on bail because they know they will get legal aid.  It is no bother to them at all.  It is no bother to them to go to jail because they learn how to do worse things when they are in there.  Many serial offenders should be locked up and the key thrown away for a long time until they see sense and understand what they have done.<\/p> <p> I want to thank those responsible for our community alerts and text alerts.  These people do much great work for their communities with the little funding they get.  I thank this Government and previous Governments for giving them a bit of funding, however small, because these people do tremendous work.  They provide a sense of confidence to the elderly people in rural communities.  I know of one elderly man who lives on a long b&oacute;ithr&iacute;n and from his kitchen window he can see the minute a car turns into his b&oacute;ithr&iacute;n.  The minute it does he goes to an outhouse across the way so that he will not be inside the house if they are raiders or intruders because he got caught once.  He will wait until he sees through a peephole who has arrived in the yard.  If it is someone he does not know he goes out the back door of that outhouse and down the fields behind the bushes.  That is not how it should be.  The closure of the Garda stations, taking them out of communities, has affected people like this by taking away their confidence.<\/p> <p> We will agree that if the incidence of rural crime is increasing, more people are being hit because so many have left rural places and the numbers have declined in many of the places we represent.  I am disappointed that the Minister put down an amendment to our motion.   <\/p> <p> We need to strengthen the trespass laws and the rights of farmers and land owners to protect their property and their person.  These trespassers can trespass on land without any prosecution because there is no law to prosecute them.

Protecting our people and our communities is a fundamental responsibility of government and one which we take extremely seriously.  It is clear that this subject resonates very strongly with Members of the House.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has highlighted some of the excellent work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling rural crime, along with the huge unprecedented resources allocated to the Commissioner, &euro;1.76 billion for this year alone; the ongoing recruitment and redeployment of garda&iacute; and the significant new legislative provisions that help garda&iacute; to fight crime and put criminals behind bars.<\/p>  <p>  Some commentators have suggested that not all crime is reported.  It is absolutely vital that as elected officials we continue to encourage all citizens to report all instances of criminality to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Only then can the crime be properly investigated by the Garda.  Also, and just as important, the reports will allow the Garda authorities to identify any new or emerging crime trends affecting a particular community and, where necessary, to allocate Garda resources in order to tackle these problems.  It will also inform the Government and this House as we develop policy and legislation.  The new Garda Commissioner has been travelling the country engaging with people and he has placed a huge emphasis on protecting the community and ensuring responsive policing.  It is important that policing is and continues to be a collaboration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community it serves.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to support and prioritise community crime prevention, including text alert, which is an example of Garda community collaboration.  The Garda text alert scheme provides an additional and effective means for members of the Garda to communicate crime prevention information to local communities.  Since it was launched in September 2013, it has grown quickly with a total of 164,000 subscribers and in the order of 3 million text messages sent annually.  Every Garda division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups.  At the National Ploughing Championship last September, the Minister for Justice and Equality announced details of the 2018 text alert rebate scheme which was available to over 1,000 local groups registered under the Garda text alerts scheme.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities that wished to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running the local text alert scheme.  In 2017, payments made under the rebate scheme almost doubled to &euro;125,000 which was paid out to almost 50 groups.<\/p> <p> The proposed motion indicates that just four CCTV grant aid applications have been approved.  It is not accurate.  In fact, 20 grant applications have been approved to date.  By voting this through, the House would be voting something through that is not accurate because 20 grant applications have been approved to date.  In furtherance of the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to support investment in CCTV schemes, a grant-aid scheme was launched by the Department of Justice and Equality in 2017 to assist in the establishment of community based CCTV schemes in the local areas.  It is intended the scheme would run for three years with funding of &euro;1 million being made available each year.  In establishing the grant-aid scheme, the Department consulted broadly, including with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Attorney General and the Local Government Management Agency.  The scheme is open to all groups wishing to take advantage of available funding and meeting the longstanding statutory requirements for establishment of CCTV schemes.  The Department continues to actively engage with all relevant parties to provide information on the scheme and to reply to any queries that arise.   <\/p> <p> There has been a lot of misinformation about this scheme but the Data Protection Commissioner has clarified the law and I am pleased that many groups have been successful with their applications.  To be clear about this, it is provided in section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, as amended, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) order 2006 that the law requires proposed community CCTV schemes to be approved by the local joint policing committee, JPC, have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner and have the powers to go to the relevant local authority, which must act as data controller in respect of the system.  I hope that clarifies that matter.<\/p> <p> Regarding criminal legal aid, as the House knows there is a constitutional requirement for criminal legal aid to ensure the right of a fair trial is upheld.  It is a fundamental principle of law that an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence when he or she comes before the court and legal representation.  Any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises with regard to prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.  Criminal legal aid is not popular but it is a necessary facet of a democratic society and a fair and just legal system.  In a demand-led system it is difficult to predict or reduce expenditure.  The more successful garda&iacute; are in bringing accused persons before the criminal courts, the more likely there will be an increased demand for criminal legal aid.  The Department is currently preparing a draft scheme of a criminal justice (legal aid) Bill.  Commitments contained in the programme for Government will be addressed in the general scheme, including the introduction of a contribution system, the introduction of more rigorous and effective means testing and provision for increased sanctions for false declarations of income.  We are looking at that as well.<\/p> <p> Regarding Garda station reopenings, the programme for Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  The Garda Commissioner's final report on the matter, which is available on the Department of Justice and Equality website, recommends that Ballinspittle Garda station be reopened along with stations in Bawnboy in County Cavan, Donard in County Wicklow, Leighlinbridge in County Carlow and Rush and Stepaside in County Dublin.  I am told the one in Ballinspittle will be completed in quarter two of 2019.  That is some information for the House.  The OPW has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  The Garda authorities are continuing to engage with the OPW with regard to design, planning, where required, and procurement of the works required to permit the reopening of these buildings as operational Garda stations.  As the works required are different at each of the six former stations, it can be expected they will reopen at different times.  The works required at Donard station have been completed already and the building has been handed over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the OPW.  Implementation of the programme and the reopening of the five remaining stations is being pursued as a priority.  I have already addressed one of them.  The OPW expects works to be completed in each case in 2019.<\/p> <p> We will monitor the outcome of the pilot scheme because it is important to stress the presence of a Garda station is not necessarily the most effective way to deter criminals.  Modern policing operations are far more sophisticated and the Garda Commissioner is best placed to determine where resources should be deployed to combat crime and protect the community.  <\/p> <p> Mention has been made of resources and &euro;342 million is being provided for ICT between 2016 and 2021.  There is a &euro;60 million Garda building and refurbishment programme.  There is &euro;46 million being provided for the Garda fleet from 2016 to 2021.  Many resources are being made available.  <\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, mentioned in his speech earlier that all Garda activities, including community policing, will benefit significantly from the financial resources provided in recent budgets.  As well as that, there is a huge injection of personnel coming on stream through the Garda recruitment and redeployment programmes.  The Government's commitment to substantially increase Garda numbers will ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country, now and into the future.  The Government will continue to offer our unwavering support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in is fight against crime.  I expect and know every Member of the House will so the same.  We will continue to place community safety at the heart of our work in the Department of Justice and Equality.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500055#CCC00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547592000,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I appreciate very much the opportunity to speak on this most important motion.  I thank our Whip, Deputy Mattie McGrath, and Triona and David in his office, for the research work they did to bring forward this very important item.  I thank everyone who contributed tonight.  Deputy Bobby Aylward has just left the Chamber but I thank him for being here up until now.  Apart from the Minister of State and Deputies in the Rural Independent Group there is no one else remaining in the Chamber.  I ask anybody to look around the Chamber and then talk about rural crime and what is happening in our countryside where old people are being terrorised in their own homes.  They should look around the Chamber and see how seriously other Deputies are taking this issue.  They are not taking it very seriously at all.  It is a very important motion that highlights an issue.  We are seeking to do this for the future and for the protection of our most vulnerable people.  It is not entirely about rural crime but it has an awful lot to do with rural crime.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about statistics.  I will give him a statistic in a simple way.  There are nine people who I know personally who were the victims of crime.  I will tell the Minister of State what type of crime was involved.  The windscreen of one person's car was broken and items were taken from inside the car.  Another person's home heating oil was taken.  It was not diesel oil for agricultural use.  That is just to give examples.  I rang the nine people and said I would never divulge their names but wanted to know if they had reported the crime to the garda&iacute;.  Of nine, two had reported it.  I do not blame the garda&iacute;.   I hear senior garda&iacute; talking about how they are combatting crime and stating that numbers are decreasing.  It is no disrespect to the garda&iacute; but they are going on false information.  I would go so far as to say the majority of crime is not reported in Ireland.  The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, are shooting in the dark because they are not being given the information.  My colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and I always encourage our constituents to report every crime.  How can we adequately say we need more resources in rural areas if we are not proving the crimes are being committed?  It is the same issue with local authorities.  How can Kerry County Council put in applications for funding for an accident prone spot unless we are reporting when a car hits the ditch or when two cars collide because of a dangerous camber on a road?  How can we adequately seek funding unless the incidents are being reported?  It was a unanimous decision of the Rural Independent Group to use our very valuable Private Members' time to discuss this issue on behalf of the people who send us up here.  We are very proud to be here to talk up for people, whether they are from Valentia Island, north Kerry, south Kerry or west Kerry.  My job is to be here to support them.  We are out every night of the week.<\/p><p>We are meeting people who are afraid inside their own homes.  There was a time when if someone inside in a house heard a rattle in the yard or a car or somebody coming, he would have a smile on his face wondering who was coming and was there some bit of gossip, some bit of a racket, some bit of a story that he would be told that night or what bit of entertainment was coming.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500056#DDD00200","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547592600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>A bit of comhluadar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500057#EEE00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1547592600,"counter":564,"content":"<p>It could be somebody calling that would be delighted to see him.  We are at the stage now that if there are people outside in the yard making noise, the people inside are afraid and thinking \"oh my goodness, who is this?\", \"who is making that noise outside?\"; older and more vulnerable people, in particular, wonder if it is an unwelcome person coming that they are afraid of.  When our people get older, they should be given more respect every day by all of us because we adore them.  We should be so glad to have them, those we have lost and the people who are left, that we want to hold onto them for as long as possible.  We want their time on this earth to be happy, safe and comfortable with no stress or duress, especially at the end of their days.<\/p>  <p>  I want to change the argument a little bit now in that we are not just concentrating 100% on rural areas.  What about the people living in our larger towns who, when they lock the door, do not want to hear anybody coming because they are afraid of who is coming?  They could be living where there are people to the left and right of them and across the road but they are still afraid because of nasty things that have happened in their localities.  This is where the Minister of State and his Government have such a part to play.  When people get caught having broken into the homes of or hurt or threatened violence on older people, for God's sake, the punishments are not half enough for that type of crime.  I unfortunately can remember one instance where two elderly brothers were held up.  The two of them are gone to their eternal reward now.  One of them was a bigger man and the other was a smaller man.  The bigger man was tied to a chair and the people who went into his house late at night beat him continually until the smaller man was made tell where they had the little couple of pounds saved in their house.  Those two people, I am sad to say, never again slept a night inside in their house, their own house where they had grown up from two small boys.  They were farming people and they lived all their lives there until they were hunted out of their house by thugs, by the scum of society that unfortunately were never caught for that crime and never spent one hour behind bars for what they did to those two lovely men.  It is things like this that upset every person and not just politicians.  We have seen it happening where elderly ladies are inside in their houses and where people break in and demand money with menace or steal their goods.  That should not be tolerated in the Ireland we are living in today.  Whatever about any other type of thing that will happen, where older people are hurt or threatened and when these people are caught we must look at the sentencing and the punishment.  There is no dread in these people.  It is the same for people who are pushing drugs.  There is no deterrent because they are not afraid.<\/p>  <p>  I said it earlier on the Plinth when Deputy Mattie McGrath organised a press conference to highlight what we were doing here today.  I thanked them very much and said I did not care whether they were Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, or the Labour Party.  I thanked every one of the Deputies who were here after the awful shooting of Veronica Guerin, when every Deputy came in here and threw off their political colours and put their shoulder to the wheel and changed laws immediately.  They brought in the Criminal Assets Bureau, one of the most successful and useful tools that we had in tackling organised crime.  Unfortunately it is not enough.  Drugs are still coming into this country but when we look at the vast coastline that we have and when the very small amount of policing that is put into our coastline it is no wonder the drugs are coming in.  I compliment the politicians of that time and the general public that supported them in ensuring that more stringent rules were put in place.  A lot of those bully boys were hunted down.  For the smart big men with the big swaggers on them when they were going around thinking that they could kill a journalist like that in broad daylight, not far from here, the smile was put on the other side of those little worms' faces when they were hunted down in their big fancy places out in Spain and dragged back and taken before the courts.  The dirty little horrible people that they were, they were put into jail and they got a long time.  They saw that their assets were stripped and taken from them and sold off to respectable people.  The only thing I can say is to hell with them and they may rot in hell along with the others who are after our older people at present because we have no sympathy whatsoever for them.<\/p>  <p>  I thank my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group.  The one thing I am disappointed with is that the Government is not supporting the motion in its entirety.  Coming along tonight and putting forward an amendment is only messing with it and the Government is not giving it the serious consideration we believe it deserves.  We are not coming here tonight in a political or adversarial way.  All we are saying is for God's sake, there are a lot of things wrong and we want them to be addressed.  We want to work with the Government on this, not against it, but unfortunately it is going against us by bringing forward a counter-motion.  As far as I can see it is only doing it for the sake of it.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the garda&iacute; in County Kerry on the sterling work they are doing with limited resources.  It is right to say they are being put on the wrong track because all they are being told now from on high is bag people and to give their time to that instead of to fighting rural crime, which is what we want them to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500057#EEE00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1547592600,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1547592600,"counter":566,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 17 January 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011500057#EEE00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1547592600,"counter":567,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.58 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 January 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
