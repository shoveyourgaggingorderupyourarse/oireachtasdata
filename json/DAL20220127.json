For example, the Almac group, the global pharmaceutical organisation headquartered in Craigavon, announced the creation of 1,000 new jobs in Northern Ireland.  Almac has consistently highlighted its unique, unfettered and flexible access to the UK, Europe and beyond under the protocol, referring to this as &ldquo;the Almac advantage&rdquo;.  Ardagh Metal Packaging announced plans to build a new state-of-the-art &euro;200 million beverage can plant in Belfast to service the growing needs of customers in Ireland, the UK and Europe.  Deli Lites, a Warrenpoint-based food producer, has reportedly won a number of accounts previously serviced by Great Britain competitors and, in October, announced 45 new jobs in its Milltown industrial estate factory as part of a Stg&pound;4.3 million investment.

We expect a significant increase in passport applications.  There are questions coming up that will allow me to address what we are doing in response, which is a dramatic increase in staff numbers in the Passport Office.<\/p>  <p>  Passport Service operations were severely disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic throughout 2020 and 2021, as were many Government services.  Despite necessary public health restrictions, the Passport Service maintained operations, with staff working onsite throughout the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service has put in place several measures to meet the demand anticipated this year including the following.  First, there is the assignment of additional permanent and temporary officers on a continuous basis to the Passport Office.  My Department has conducted a major recruitment drive in recent months and I expect that, by the end of January, staffing numbers will be at approximately 777, which is a 70% increase on June of last year.  Additional staff will continue to be assigned to the Passport Office throughout February and March.  The new Passport Office in Swords is now operational and can accommodate 140 staff.  Second, the Passport Service is engaged in intensive training of staff to ensure they have adequate resources to process complex applications.  Third, the Passport Service is continually looking at ways to improve processing times.  A particular improvement that is currently being rolled out and will be of interest to the Deputy is a change to the document management process that reduces the turnaround time when additional documents need to be submitted by the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the simplification of the process, the Passport Service continually works to streamline the application process.  Comprehensive information is available on all aspects of the application process on my Department&rsquo;s website and the Passport Service continually reviews these instructions in order to make them more accessible.  In addition, there are over 60 staff on the customer service team dedicated to answering applicants' questions by phone and webchat.  This number will increase as additional staff are assigned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700006#D00600","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I hear the reply but there are huge issues with people getting their passports on time, especially children's passports, both first-time applications and renewals.

The problem is that the extra or missing information is not sought until too near the date when the application was supposed to be granted.  That seems to be where the problem is.  The applications should be looked at from the start, when they are submitted, and the information should be asked for then.  There is something wrong.

First-time applications, particularly for children, take longer to process because of security issues.  We must ensure we address fraud, especially for first-time applicants.

This process culminated on 13 October 2021 with the presentation of a comprehensive package of proposals aimed at providing a credible and durable solution to the genuine issues on the ground in Northern Ireland.  The package makes proposals around issues of customs checks and sanitary and phytosanitary issues designed to facilitate the flow of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It also sets out proposals around strengthening Northern Irish involvement in the governance of the protocol.<\/p>  <p>  On 17 December 2021, the Commission followed up its October package with new legislative proposals that ensure the continued long-term supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and that further support supply lines in Ireland, Cyprus and Malta.

It respects the fine balance at the heart of the protocol: protecting the Good Friday Agreement, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time protecting EU consumers and the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market.  The proposals form the basis of the Commission&rsquo;s discussions with the UK Government, an approach that has the strong support of all member states, confirmed again this week.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I, along with other Ministers, regularly discuss the protocol in contacts with UK counterparts, our EU partners, stakeholders across Northern Ireland and key figures in the US Administration and Congress.

When I was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, she was my counterpart in the UK.  She is a very able minister.  She has held many portfolios.  She is someone who has a reputation for being a dealmaker and a can-do minister and she is now bringing that energy to this portfolio.  We met in early January and spoke at length about the need for an agreement.  I think she wants to find an agreement.  Certainly, the European side does as well.<\/p>  <p>  The issues around the protocol have been dragging on for far too long.  They are contributing to a very polarised atmosphere in Northern Ireland, which is both unwelcome and unhelpful in the build-up to elections in May.  Therefore, we all have an obligation to try to settle the outstanding issues.  The point I made very clearly, to Liz Truss and publicly, is the EU is not in the space of renegotiating the protocol and writing a new one.  However, it is in the space of trying to offer the maximum flexibility possible in terms of how the existing agreement, which is international law, can be implemented in a way that works for everybody.  That is what Vice-President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and his team have been trying to do with their proposals before Christmas, which were very substantial proposals in the effort to reduce checks on goods coming from GB into Northern Ireland and remaining there in sense of being purchased and consumed there.  It is the belief of the EU that, by co-operation, we could reduce checks on those products from a sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, perspective by up to 80% and could halve the checks burden linked to customs.  The EU has said it would like that to be the basis now for further discussion with respect to how that could be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to give an indication to the House that these issues will be easily resolved.  There is still a big gap between both sides.  Even though the conversations have been much more personal and warmer in many ways with Liz Truss now in charge on the British side, the issues themselves, in the sense of actual solutions on the table, are still very difficult.  She certainly has not softened the UK Government's position on the key issues, even though there is much more personal engagement now in an effort to try to find a way forward.<\/p>  <p>  As a final point, time is important here.

The strategic compass provides for greater work in the area of capability development as well as further investment in innovative technologies.  From the Irish perspective, we consider effective capabilities as key to an effective CSDP.  In practical terms, the strengthening of our capabilities will help improve the EU&rsquo;s ability to undertake peacekeeping and crisis management tasks as outlined in the Treaty on European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, different member states bring different perspectives to bear in discussions on security and defence.  Ireland&rsquo;s position continues to be recognised by our fellow member states and we remain clear that our active participation in CSDP does not prejudice the specific character of our security and defence policy or our obligations.  Within the EU, defence and security are a national competence and this includes national spending on defence and security.  This means that any decision, including any deepening of EU co-operation, any increase to national spending on defence and security or strengthening of the EU as a defence sector, will require unanimity.

That is exactly the approach we are now bringing to these discussions on the strategic compass and the future of defence and security issues.  We will continue to advocate on that.

The Minister's Cabinet colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made comments yesterday about the potential closure of Cathal Brugha Barracks and a feasibility study, of which he already knows the outcome, that will see the closure of the barracks and the development of up to 1,000 residential units in their place.  That has sent out a negative message to the Defence Forces, which are on their knees and concerned about their future and viability at a time we are talking about the closure of barracks.  Does the Minister think the timing of that intervention by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was helpful?  What kind of message did it send to the Defence Forces?

I thank the members of the review group for agreeing to undertake this significant piece of work.  The independent review is seen as a critical and vital next step to ensure the workplace for serving members of the Defence Forces is safe, where there is zero tolerance of unacceptable behaviour and where we learn from historical experiences.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have engaged extensively in recent months with the Women of Honour group and other stakeholders, including both serving and former members of the Defence Forces; the representative associations; PDFORRA; the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO; the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA; and a second group representing former members.  These engagements have brought serious issues to my attention, which indicate that it is not just an historic issue, unfortunately.  Incidents of alleged unacceptable behaviour are continuing to occur.  Current and former members of the Defence Forces have been clear that the culture that is pervading and the application of those policies, systems and procedures for dealing with unacceptable behaviour have not and are not serving all Defence Forces personnel as well as they should be.  A further round of engagement with stakeholders took place on Tuesday afternoon last when I provided an update to stakeholders on the Government decision to proceed with the independent review.  This was the seventh meeting at senior level that has been held with the Women of Honour group since last September, three of which I attended personally.<\/p>  <p>  Current and former members of the Defence Forces have welcomed the review.

That was most welcome for those who had such negative experiences.  After that documentary, the Minister told me that \"real change\" would be delivered and that there were \"too many stories in this space that are not historic but current\".

It should be noted, however, that the number of personnel stationed at a particular location will frequently vary on an ongoing basis as it is a normal operational feature for there to be a constant flow-through of personnel into and out of military installations.<\/p>  <p>  The rolling Defence Forces build infrastructure programme provides a blueprint for investment in Defence Forces built infrastructure over a five-year timeframe and is designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities of the Defence Forces.

Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act,1923, as amended, provides that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAny compensation which may be received from or on behalf of the person alleged to be responsible for the act which caused the wounding [&hellip;] may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension, allowance or gratuity which might be awarded under this Act to or in respect of such person.

Even though cases have been referred back to the courts on the basis of the situation, this issue prevails.  It is totally outrageous that an award made by the courts is arbitrarily undermined, questioned and turned on its head by a decision, enabled by this Act, that part of the award made by the courts be recovered when the member of the Defence Forces is at a more vulnerable stage, that is, when in receipt of his or her military pension.

It is provided for under legislation and is done on foot of a bona fide decision by the Minister after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the individual case.  The person or his or her solicitor is advised of the statutory provisions and of the potential implications of his or her application.  Representations are invited regarding the person's circumstances, details of the compensation actually received and whether there are any special or extenuating circumstances involved.  On receipt of representations, cases are submitted to the Minister for decision, setting out the relevant facts of the case, including details of the representations made and an actuarial assessment in pension cases.  The actuarial assessment, which is carried out by an actuary based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, translates the compensation into an annuity value based upon various assumptions, including the date the money was received and the life expectancy of the individual.  Full account is then taken of representations made and the actuarial assessment before a final decision is made by the Minister.  There are no plans to discontinue the application of this statutory provision at this time.  There is a process where cases are looked at on an individual basis.

It has caused severe hardship to an awful lot of people.  The Department is effectively stating again and again that these people should not really have had an award in the first place and that it has the right to second-guess the courts and decide of its own accord that it will take back the equivalent value through a reduced pension in the future.

The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to prevent double compensation in respect of the same disablement.  That is what it is specifically trying to do.  Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the Department of Defence but compensation received from any other source is, of course, not excluded.  If somebody takes a civil case against the Department for injuries or disablement linked to their time in the Defence Forces, that is factored in in the context of compensation they may have been previously granted as part of a pension entitlement.  This provision is about trying to ensure there is not double compensation as a result of that.  That is the purpose of the section.

There are several Deputies here so I hope the Acting Chairman will give me some latitude when answering these questions.<\/p>  <p>  As of 31 December 2021, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 8,468 personnel, or 89% of the agreed establishment of 9,500.  While the Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining, the agreed strength of each branch of the Defence Forces, there are a number of factors, many of which are hard to predict, that will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.  In addition to a range of measures already undertaken to address the staffing issues, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which is currently being finalised, will also address this matter directly.<\/p>  <p>  As regards current recruitment initiatives, general service recruitment is ongoing and resulted in 576 personnel being inducted in 2021.  The level of turnover in the Defence Forces in 2021 was 7.89%, which includes those in training.  It is worth noting that the average turnover rate for general service recruits who do not complete training, for a variety of reasons, has been approximately 30% over the past number of years.  On the question raised by Deputy O'Callaghan, some 31% of commissioned officers have been inducted in the past five years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to ongoing recruitment, the scope of direct entry competitions, along with the terms and conditions, continues to be expanded and revised to improve intake.  The re-entry campaign for former members of the Permanent Defence Force continues.  The service commitment schemes in both the Air Corps and Naval Service and a special Naval Service tax credit for seagoing personnel are examples of targeted retention measures that I have introduced.<\/p> <p>There has been significant progress on pay, arising out of increases due from recent pay agreements, the most recent of which was a 1% increase on annualised salaries or &euro;500, whichever is the greater, on 1 October last year, with further increases to follow.<\/p> <p> Additionally, the Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC, report on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces made a range of recommendations with a view to addressing recruitment and retention issues.  These have been progressed through a series of projects.  While the 2022 recruitment plan is not yet finalised, the Defence Forces remain committed to optimising the number of personnel inducted.<\/p> <p> I am confident that along with all other initiatives under way, the pay benefits delivered by the public service pay agreements, in tandem with the implementation of the PSPC recommendations, will improve recruitment and retention challenges currently experienced by the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, the Commission on the Defence Forces is finalising its work with a view to completing the report as soon as possible.  The commission's report, when submitted, will be fully considered at that point.  There is, as one would expect, a very strong emphasis on recruitment, retention and HR within the Defence Forces in its terms of reference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700016#O01700","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643282400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answer.  Recruitment and retention are considerably important issues in the Defence Forces.  The focus of my question was to try to identify the proportion of commissioned officers who have more than five years' experience.  The Minister was at the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, conference last year and he probably heard its general secretary state that 24% of personnel in the Defence Forces had less than five years' experience but 35% of officers had less than five years' service.<\/p>  <p>  This is linked to the question of recruitment and retention and it is important we try to ensure that we retain experienced officers within the Defence Forces.  Experience matters a great deal, especially in areas such as defence of the country.  I am not suggesting that inexperienced people do not have an important role to play, but it is important to have that body of experience among commissioned officers in the ranks of the Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister whether any other options are available to ensure we can retain those commissioned officers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700017#P00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1643282400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>The Deputy highlighted an important area.  The way in which we solve the recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces will not simply be through a large intake in a very short space of time, because that has consequences from the perspective of training, command and control, experience and so on.  That is why we have an ongoing discussion with the Defence Forces and the Chief of Staff and his team, on how we can maximise the number of people coming in each year and, at the same time, ensure we have appropriate training procedures to ensure we maintain the skill sets and leadership we need within the Defence Forces to deliver on what is asked of them.<\/p>  <p>  The figure I gave was that 31%, rather than 35%, of commissioned officers have been inducted in the past five years.  Either way, it is approximately one in three officers and we need to make sure we hold on to the experience in the Defence Forces, where possible.  The direction of travel the commission report will provide in terms of certainty, ambition and resources may well, I hope, encourage many people to stay in the Defence Forces for longer and, in doing so, hold on to that very important experience.<\/p>  <p>  We have very significant skill sets within the Defence Forces.  Sometimes those skill sets are targeted from outside and people are headhunted out of the Defence Forces, be they pilots, engineers, cybersecurity experts or drivers.  We need to try to make sure that what drives people to join the Defence Forces remains burning in them in terms of their willingness to stay and serve their country.

My question was on when we will meet 9,500 target strength in the Permanent Defence Force.  I completely agree with the Minister about the synergies in terms of private sector employment people can take up after serving in the Defence Forces.  People have an opportunity to serve their country, train and perhaps educate themselves and then go on into the private sector to contribute to their country in different ways.  That model always worked and it provides us with a strong skill set, especially in the tech and communications sectors.  However, the difficulty now is that what might have been a stint of ten or 15 years, or even longer, in the Defence Forces before going into a senior, management, engineering or technical role in one of those organisations has become a few years, with people being moved on before they have had the opportunity to contribute to the country.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence visited Haulbowline recently and heard first-hand the experience of many being recruited into the private sector and leaving, after having been trained up and invested in.

This independent review is seen as a critical and vital next step to ensure the workplace for serving members of the Defence Forces is safe, where there is zero tolerance of unacceptable behaviour and where we learn from historical experience.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have engaged extensively in recent months with the Women of Honour group and with other stakeholders, including both serving and former members of the Defence Forces, the representative associations, PDFORRA, RACO, and the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, and with a second group representing former members.<\/p>  <p>  These engagements have brought serious issues to my attention, which indicate it is not just an historic issue we are dealing with.  Incidents of alleged unacceptable behaviour are continuing to occur.  Current and former members of the Defence Forces have been clear that the culture that is pervading and the application of those policies, systems and procedures for dealing with unacceptable behaviour have not and are not serving all Defence Forces personnel well.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent engagement with stakeholders took place on Tuesday afternoon last where I provided an update to stakeholders on the Government decision to proceed with the independent review.  This was the seventh meeting, as I said earlier, at senior level that has been held with the Women of Honour group since last September, three of which I personally attended.<\/p>  <p>  Current and former members of the Defence Forces have welcomed the review, and while I acknowledge the disappointment expressed by the Women of Honour group, which has been seeking a commission of inquiry, I am strongly aware of the need for immediacy of action to ensure the safety of serving Defence Forces personnel.<\/p>  <p>  I want to be clear this does not preclude Government from considering further bodies of work that may be necessary.  The review group has been specifically asked to advise on whether further work is required to examine issues of an historical nature and to make any recommendations regarding how this might be pursued.<\/p>  <p>  The review group will provide me with an interim report in six months.  A final report is expected within nine months.  I will bring the final review report to Government, which may consider any further bodies of work that might be necessary, taking into account the findings of the independent review group.  Thereafter, I intend to make the final review report public.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the Secretary General and Chief of Staff to ensure every member of the Defence Forces can carry out his or her duties in a safe and respectful workplace based on dignity, equality and zero tolerance for any kind of unacceptable behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Having spoken to the chair of this review group who is a former High Court judge, I can assure Deputy Carroll MacNeill she will be insisting on full co-operation and I expect that will very much be in the report if she is not getting that co-operation.

The aim of the strategy is to provide a co-ordinated and effective mental health and support system for the personnel of the Defence Forces through the adoption of a series of measures between 2020 and 2023.  Eight supporting objectives - governance, resilience, suicide, stigma, critical incident stress management, a comprehensive approach, military families and a model for clinical support - have been identified as essential components of the strategy to support the principal aim.

They should be troubling for all of us.  Anybody following this story will know how distressing the details are and how devastating this must be for those children and their families who were so let down by the State.  Not only were they let down by the State, but they were harmed by the State.  Forty-six young people suffered significant harm, with a further 200 put at significant risk.  This harm ranged from extreme tiredness to high blood pressure, excessive weight gain and the production of breast milk.  Hundreds of children were misdiagnosed.  They were put on a dangerous combination of medication.  They were left to their own devices with a serious lack of follow-ups or checks about their medications.  One family told a colleague of mine that they were so concerned about the changes in their child's behaviour and appearance that they challenged the doctor, only for the doctor to threaten to report them to Tusla.  That is disgraceful.<\/p>  <p>  Failures in clinical governance and oversight have had real consequences for the health and well-being of these children.  Those consequences will last for a long time.  There was no consultant psychiatrist to provide clinical oversight.  As soon as a locum consultant, Dr. Sharma, was appointed, he saw the problems immediately.  He must be credited for the fast, decisive action that he took as a whistleblower.  The treatment that he received as a whistleblower needs to be investigated.  He claims that he was asked to take time off and reassigned from his clinical role to administrative duties.  He resigned because he felt his position was undermined and that needs to be examined.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that there will be audits of adherence to clinical guidelines and prescription practices.  My colleague Deputy Ward and Sinn F&eacute;in have called on the Government to do this since March of last year.  It has belatedly agreed to do this in the last week.  That is not enough.  It is only three years since three consultant psychiatrists resigned from CAMHS in Waterford and Wexford because of how poor and unsafe the conditions were due to understaffing.  Yesterday, we learned that more than 50 children were inappropriately placed in adult psychiatric units over the last two years.  They were units that were unfit and unsafe for young people.  It is not just one person or one area.  This is a systemic failure for our young people and patients in many areas across the State.  It goes back to understaffing and under-resourcing and substantial vacancies in consultant and nursing posts.  This is not the story of today or yesterday.  One in five consultant psychiatrist posts is either vacant or filled on a temporary basis.  Some of these posts have been vacant for years and years.<\/p>  <p>  This issue has plagued our mental health services for the best part of a decade.  In that time, the T&aacute;naiste has been Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, and Minister for Health, and throughout that time, he has sat at the Cabinet table.  There needs to be a step change from the Government, not more apologies.  We want action and for the system to be fixed.  What will the T&aacute;naiste do to ensure that child and adolescent mental health services are fit for purpose?  Will he ensure that the review that has been commissioned will look not only at the guidelines for prescription practices but also at the capacity and gaps in the service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700021#T00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1643284800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Speaking as a public representative but also as a doctor, I am disturbed and worried by what I have read and heard about what happened with psychiatric services for children in Kerry.  I extend my sympathies to the children who have been affected and to their families.  What it appears has happened is very serious, including misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of psychiatric conditions, with children being put on medicines inappropriately and those medicines not being monitored appropriately.  These are basic failures of medical care that simply cannot be defended.  They should not have happened and should have been identified and acted on much sooner than they were.  The most important thing that we can do as a State and health service is to make sure we put in place the services and supports that the children and families need so that we can, if at all possible, rectify and remedy the harm that was done.  That will range from good quality psychiatric care for the children who need it to other supports for families to help them manage and deal with what has happened.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report has been sent to the garda&iacute;, who may have a role in this, and also to the Medical Council.  Ultimately, only the Medical Council has the authority to sanction medical practitioners, if that is appropriate.  As the Deputy knows as a Member of this D&aacute;il, having been part of many budget debates, the budget for mental health is now more than &euro;1 billion a year.  It has increased dramatically in recent years, by 20% or 30% in the last few years alone.  Money and resources do not always solve problems on their own.  It can be very difficult to fill consultant posts, even when we are willing to offer a contract worth over &euro;200,000 a year, which is the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's own party has been involved in running the health services in Northern Ireland for over 20 years.  He will be aware of the difficulties that arise with recruiting specialist staff, not just in this jurisdiction, but also in Northern Ireland and indeed globally.<\/p>  <p>  My thoughts are with the families and children affected by this.  To learn of the systemic failings in their care is devastating.  I can only imagine how distressing and upsetting it is for the families involved.  An integral part of this process was open disclosure in action.  Open disclosure has happened on this occasion in a way that is perhaps better than in the past.  One of the first things that was done was to provide 240 young people identified as having had deficits in their care, and their families, with meetings.  The HSE apologised to each individual at these meetings, and also in writing, for any harm caused.  It is clear from the review that there were significant failings in the care provided to children and young people at multiple levels of the system.  There were also failings of clinical oversight.<\/p> <p>The report has made findings in regard to these and there are recommendations to improve services.  The HSE has considered the report locally and nationally and has accepted all of its recommendations.  Work is under way to implement it.  That will be monitored by the Government.  Among the recommendations identified are an assessment of reconfiguration of the service and a full nationwide audit of compliance with CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams to make sure that similar problems are not happening in other parts of the country, which I know people will be concerned about.  As Deputy Doherty mentioned, a prescribing audit will be conducted for each of the 72 CAMHS teams nationally.  There are 72 CAMHS teams across the country and there will be a prescribing audit in each case to see if similar issues might have arisen in other parts of the country.  We do not believe that is the case but we want to assure ourselves that it is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700021#T00600","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643285400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>As I mentioned, this is not the story of one location, one doctor, one problem or one scandal.

He could have given the same script, speech or response three years ago when a psychiatrist resigned from the south east because it was unsafe and unsound in terms of CAMHS.

This has been condemned by the Ombudsman for Children but there is no action.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue in terms of the contract but the Government created a two-tier contract.  Pay cuts were made that have not been reversed.  Will the review include an examination of capacity issues?  There are capacity issues in the south east, in the north west and right across the State.  There are 3,065 children on CAMHS waiting lists.  More than 800 of those children have been waiting for six months and over 300 of them have been waiting for a year.

In the past 20 years, his party has been in government on this island as long as my party has been.  His party has co-chaired a government that is in charge of health services in Northern Ireland which consistently perform inferiorly to our health services here in terms of patient outcomes.  If Deputy Doherty is holding me responsible for any clinical failures in the past ten or 20 years here in this State, then surely his party is responsible for the failures that have occurred at a clinical level north of the Border.  Sinn F&eacute;in cannot have one standard for us but no standards for itself.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to capacity issues, it is accepted that we have capacity constraints, not just in our mental health services but in our health services generally.

It was heartbreaking to listen to.  The raw honesty meant it was something that one just had to listen to.  He spoke of how his son lost his personality and lost his smile.  It was one of those moments when one had to not just stop and listen, but also digest.  Collectively, we all have to digest what has happened here.  Imagine being in the room when Jason's father and sister were told this news and Jason's first response was to ask if it meant he was going to die.  We have to deal with this issue.<\/p>  <p>  What really shook me when Maurice O'Connell was telling his story was that there was an implication in the report that this was not catastrophic.  Sure, Jason did not lose a leg or an arm but I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that this is catastrophic for these children.  We all have to accept that.  To say the community in south Kerry is shocked, appalled and worried is an understatement.  I know a little bit about that, as the T&aacute;naiste is well aware, because I have a lot of extended family down there.  Deputy Griffin, who is behind the T&aacute;naiste, knows that as well.

There is deep shock at what has happened and concern as to whether people can trust the service.<\/p>  <p>  The real issue, in the context of the audit that will be carried out, is that people who have the resources can go outside the public system and pay for second opinions but the majority of people cannot.  In my experience, CAMHS has been very much impenetrable and lacking in scrutiny.  There are some very good people in the service but there are silos in operation.  This is not due to just one rogue operator but to systemic failure over many years for which we are all guilty, every one of us.  We are going to have to deal with this in a certain way.

I am a politician and a medical doctor.  I have come across, as have all of us in this House, a number of examples of failings in care and failures in our health service to provide the standard of care that we would expect for ourselves and our families.  This is very much at the more severe end, in my view.  What happened here is hard to accept.  It is hard to accept that it happened in our country, and that there were huge failures of this nature involving children, in particular.  Maybe it should it not, but it makes it feel worse that children who were supposed to be helped were harmed.  There was overdiagnosis and there were incorrect diagnoses.  Children were put on the wrong medicines and left on them for too long, and those medicines were not properly monitored.  That just should not happen and it should have been detected and identified much earlier.<\/p>  <p>  It is very disturbing that we find ourselves talking about this and more particularly, that those families are experiencing what they are experiencing at the moment.  I do not think any of us can begin to contemplate how they must feel and how worried they must be.  The most important thing that we must try to do is to put this right.  That means making sure the families and children affected receive the services and supports they need.  The HSE needs to be forthcoming and generous in that regard.  There will not be any financial barrier from the Government when it comes to providing them with the services and supports they need.  We have done that in previous instances, like with CervicalCheck, for example, where packages of support were put in place for families and patients and that needs to be done now.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the detail of the review and how that is going to work, the Cabinet has not yet had a chance to discuss this.  We will discuss it on Tuesday and I know the Minister of State will provide more information on how that is going to operate as soon as she has it.  I am sure it is absolutely the case that it will be necessary to provide financial compensation to many of the families affected by this.  These are clear failings in care.  This was care that was clearly not up to basic professional standards.<\/p> <p>I have absolutely no doubt that families will bring cases forward, they will be assessed and compensation payments will need to be made.  The Deputy knows from his experiences, as I do from mine, that this is a lot more complicated than it seems because every case is individual.

According to the report, \"The service has not implemented many of the recommendations of the CAMHS Standard Operating Procedure 2015 or the subsequent CAMHS Operational Guideline 2019.\"  Why?

The Stardust fire is embedded in the memories not only of the people of Dublin, but the collective memory of the nation.  There was no one untouched by the fire, from Cork to Donegal, from Sligo to Louth.  Everyone knew someone who was at the Stardust nightclub on that terrible Valentine&rsquo;s night in 1981.<\/p>  <p>  It is incredible that 41 years on from the disaster, the survivors and families are still waiting for justice to this day.  They are still waiting for the opening of a fair and transparent inquest into how their loved ones died.  It has been accepted that previous inquests and inquiries were flawed and left pertinent questions unanswered.  The likes of John and Christine Keegan are no longer with us and will never see justice.  They lost two daughters in the Stardust fire, but their daughter Antoinette, who survived the fire, continues to seek justice.<\/p>  <p>  Maurice and Phyllis McHugh, who lost their only daughter, are still waiting for justice, as are so many other families that lost loved ones.  It is a principle of law that justice delayed is justice denied.  After a wait of 41 years, there can be no doubt that justice continues to be denied to the survivors and families that lost loved ones in the Stardust fire.  One of the more recent delays relates to the State's inability to identify an appropriate setting for the inquest.  In a city with a multitude of venues to choose from, such a reason for delay is difficult to accept.  I am also led to believe that matters pertaining to the transparency of the process are also causing delays.<\/p>  <p>  I am led to believe there was a proposal that the Garda would choose the jury for the inquest.  This has been dropped after family objections.  The issue that now exists is that the members of the jury will not be paid for their service.  This is a major problem as the inquest is expected to last months.  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to work with relevant Departments to identify funding to pay an inquest jury for a few months.  It is the least that the State can do considering the unnecessary trauma we have put the survivors and families of the victims through.<\/p>  <p>  On the night of 14 June 2017 in London, England, a horrific fire at a block of apartments killed 72 people.  Within two years of that date, a coroner&rsquo;s inquest had been completed, a Commons select committee hearing on the disaster was completed, the first phase of a two-phase inquiry was completed, and the second and final phase of the inquiry is under way despite delays as a result of Covid-19.  All these processes have found significant culpability by public bodies, and there is little criticism of the process.  Compare that to the Stardust fire inquiries here: there is no comparison.  There can be little doubt that the British Government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire was respectful and delivered truth and justice.  It did not shirk from seeking out those responsible.  They were not compromised by uncomfortable truths.  We all know that a proper and transparent inquest into the Stardust nightclub fire will reveal facts that will discomfort elements of the political establishment in this country.<\/p>  <p>  When the findings are compared to previous flawed inquiries, questions will be asked, but that is no reason to deny the survivors and families of the victims justice after 40 years.  This cannot continue any longer.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste for the sake of the survivors and families of victims of the Stardust nightclub fire, to make a commitment to the House that the inquiry into Stardust will be delayed no more.  Will the T&aacute;naiste assure both this House and the nation that the continued trauma caused to the survivors and families by delay after delay, excuse after excuse, will come to an end?  Will he do all in his power to bring about a just and timely commencement of the inquiry without further delay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700023#V00600","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1643286000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I wish to extend once again my sympathies and condolences to the families affected by the Stardust tragedy and all who have followed this issue down the years.  The decision to carry out these inquests was made by the Attorney General in the last Government, S&eacute;amus Woulfe, who acceded to the request by the families that the matter should be reopened and that inquests should be held.  I led that Government at the time and very much agreed with the decision he made.  That was the first time in a very long time that a Government had responded to the request by families that it be done.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed as a Government to ensuring that the Stardust inquest continues in a safe and suitable environment in 2022.  This might be made more simple in the coming weeks because of the easing of the public health restrictions.  There are plans to secure a new venue for the inquests to be continued by the Dublin coroner when the contract on the bespoke courtroom in the RDS expires in February.  The matter is actively being worked on with the assistance of the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Government intends that the situation will be resolved as soon as possible.  To date, nine pre-inquest hearings have been completed and the tenth is expected to take place on 2 February.<\/p>  <p>  The Stardust fire was a national tragedy that has left a particular legacy of pain for many people in north Dublin.  I sympathise greatly with the families of the 48 young people tragically killed in the fire.  As the Deputy will be aware, the conduct of inquests is independent and has to be independent of the Government.  It is entirely a matter for the senior Dublin coroner, Dr. Myra Cullinane.  Her independence in relation to such matters is set out in the Coroners Acts and the Government cannot interfere with her work.  Dr. Cullinane has begun her work and nine pre-inquest hearings have been completed to date, the ninth having taken place on 19 January, and the tenth scheduled for 2 February.  The Department of Justice has also developed a website for the inquest, assigned additional staff to the office of the Dublin coroner and facilitated the appointment of legal and expert guidance to support the coroner in her work.<\/p>  <p>  During 2021, a bespoke courtroom was built in the RDS to facilitate the inquests.  That contract will expire soon.  We recognise that this is a very sensitive situation and want to assure the families that we are committed to ensuring a new venue is in place to permit the inquest to be continued by the coroner.

I do not have a problem with it where gas is concerned.  However, the fact is we are relying on gas coming from Russia and it is like a tap at the moment, in that it can be turned up or down at any stage.  US President Joe Biden announced yesterday they were going to do all in their power to ensure Europe was going to be okay and bring in liquefied natural gas, LNG.  Ironically enough, Ireland as a country and the Government have decided that they are going to block a proposed LNG terminal.  Yesterday, I listened in astonishment to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, speaking on the radio about offshore wind.  While I have no problem with offshore wind, at the moment it produces 1% of our energy.  With the best will in the world it is nine or ten years away.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that in March 2020 a litre of green diesel for a tractor cost between 41 cent and 42 cent for the farming community, the contractors who do the work and indeed the builders around the country who work machines for building houses.  Yesterday, it cost between 92 cent and 94 cent in bulk.  For the people who drive to work every day, white diesel today costs &euro;1.68 and petrol &euro;1.78.  These are people who, as the T&aacute;naiste has said before, get up early in the morning and go to work.  I fully agree with looking after the people who are on low incomes, such as those on the fuel allowance, and there has been much talk of that.  However, what is this Government's plan?  I do not mean eight years down the line when we get the offshore turbines.  It is not going to happen tomorrow.  What is our plan for the next three to six months for the farmer whose fertiliser has now gone from &euro;350 or &euro;400 depending on the type to &euro;870 or &euro;970, again dependent on type?  What is going to happen the contractor who cuts the silage for the farmer with the Government putting in another carbon tax in May on green diesel?  Bear in mind white diesel in 2020 was &euro;1.20.  Green diesel is going to be &euro;1, from what we can see, over the coming weeks.  What is going to happen to the people who get up early in the mooring and drive to work, bearing in mind that we have not the facility for the LNG and that we basically brought in legislation in the previous D&aacute;il that said there would be no more exploration?  If the EU puts gas under the green energy banner, will there be exploration then?  Will the legislation be changed so Ireland can do that?  Are we going to put in the LNG stations so we can take it in?

Ireland does not use very much Russian gas.  Pretty much half our gas comes from our own supplies in the Corrib gas field and the other half comes from Britain.  Most of that either comes from Britain, Norway or Qatar.  The gas comes from Qatar on ships to LNG terminals in Britain and then comes across the pipelines into Ireland.  Thus, while we do not have an LNG terminal, we use LNG.  It just comes in from Britain rather than coming into one of our ports.  While any potential reduction or cut off in Russian gas would not directly hit supplies here, there would of course be a knock-on effect because if the supply goes down globally, the price will go up globally.<\/p>  <p>  On LNG, I understand there is a planning application in from a private company, New Fortress Energy, to build an LNG terminal in north Kerry.  The Government is not supporting that project because we believe the future is in renewable energy and hydrogen but we are not going to block it either.  There is a planning process and if the company gets planning permission and can finance its project then it will be able to proceed.  It is not the case the Government is blocking it but we have decided not to support it actively because we do not think long-term 30- or 40-year investments in fossil fuels of this nature make sense.  The same thing applies to exploration.  There are already many existing licences and those licences stand.  People can use them.  If more gas is discovered as a consequence of exploration on foot of those licences that gas will be brought ashore.  We do not think it makes sense to issue new licences that would not be acted on for decades, perhaps, because we do not want to be taking that gas out in 30 or 40 years' time when we will have the alternative sources of energy we aim to have.<\/p>  <p>  On the general issue of fuel prices and the cost of living, everyone in Government appreciates the cost of living is rising and that we are seeing levels of inflation at 5% and 6%, which we have not seen in 20 years.  We used to see them a lot but we have not for about 20 years and that is creating a real squeeze.  It is really affecting family budgets, creating a real squeeze for many families, increasing business costs and also having a significant impact on people on low incomes who, if they have to choose to spend more on petrol, diesel or energy, then have to choose to spend less on things like groceries, for example.  That has a real impact.  That is why I was an early advocate, as far back as last June, of ensuring we had a welfare, pensions and tax package in the last budget.  The best way to help people with the cost of living is to increase their incomes, increase their take-home pay and give them the discretion as to how they spend their money.  That is why I signed off on that increase in the minimum wage.  It is why pay is being increased in the public service.  It is why we had a welfare, pensions and tax package which many people actually opposed at the time.  We appreciate we need to do more.  One part of that is the energy credit that is being worked on at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700024#W00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1643286600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>It might be worthwhile for the T&aacute;naiste to go back to his Department to look at the amount of gas we are getting from the UK or from Scotland for the simple reason that England, if you read the statistics and the facts, is in a slight bit of bother in relation to it, even though it has its own.<\/p>  <p>  On the second part of the T&aacute;naiste's answer, yes, there were social welfare increases and, yes, there were tax breaks and changes to the minimum wage but the reality of it is that at the moment the general household will probably be down &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 between driving to work, maybe doing a bit of farming and buying fertiliser.

Quite simply, it is fair to say we are failing as a nation to address the scourge of human trafficking.<\/p><p>If we look at the Trafficking in Persons, TIP, Report produced by the US State Department,124 countries are ranked higher than us, that is, doing more than we are in this regard.  In June 2020, we fell to the tier 2 watchlist.  In June 2021, we were still on the tier 2 watchlist.  After two years on the tier 2 watchlist, there is an automatic falling to tier 3, which brings with it all sorts of consequences for our State with regard to our relationship with America.  Really, however, this is not about self-interest.  Behind the TIP Report are a huge number of vulnerable victims whom we are ultimately failing.<\/p><p>If we look at the expos&eacute; by both <i>The Guardian<\/i>and the International Transport Workers Federation of the fishing industry, we see the brutal conditions to which victims of trafficking and labour exploitation are often exposed.  There is a major issue of sexual exploitation and forced work in this country.<\/p><p>The Amnesty International report released the other day showed exactly the dangers to which those people in forced sex work positions are exposed.  The Global Slavery Index estimates there are 8,000 victims of trafficking in Ireland, but in 2020 we identified only 38.  It was the fourth year in a row where the number of victims of trafficking we identified had fallen.  Our response to trafficking and our ability to identify victims of it is getting worse.<\/p><p>Until 2021, there were no successful prosecutions with regard to human trafficking.  We need to change the way in which we engage with the recognition of victims and how we provide support to give them the safety to come out and be able to talk about their experiences.  We must support and make it easier for them to do that.<\/p><p>My Bill introduces an early identification system that is much broader than the current system, which only allows for the Garda.  It includes social workers, support workers, NGOs and trade unions.  These are people who will be dealing more directly with the victims of trafficking and who can contribute to their early identification.  It includes a system of supports for victims so they are not left abandoned and alone.  It includes issues around immunity from prosecution, which is an essential element, particularly if someone is being trafficked here and forced to engage in criminal behaviour.  The immunity is needed for such a person to be able to escape the situation he or she is in.  It also includes the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to child victims so that our focus on the most vulnerable victims of trafficking is improved.<\/p><p>I have been working on this Bill for some time.  In recent months, the Government announced its intention to review the referral mechanism.  Since that intention was announced last year, we have had no further details.  It is not just about the referral mechanism.  It is about supports in and around that, for example, as I mentioned earlier, guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>supports for victims and the issue of immunity.  These are all the essential elements of responding to human trafficking and our better support of victims.<\/p><p>There have been efforts at awareness campaigns but we need more than awareness campaigns.  We need to review and reform the structure around the identification of victims and the supports they get so that it is easier for them to be identified and to seek and be given help.  That is the reason I move this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700028#AA00700","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1643289000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700028#AA00800","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1643289000,"counter":336,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700028#AA00900","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643289000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1643289000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700028#AA01100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1643289000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700028#AA01200","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643289000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643289000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 1.55 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan: Statements","time":1643289600,"counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700029#EE00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1643289600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Tos&oacute;imid le r&aacute;itis agus ceisteanna agus freagra&iacute; faoin bplean n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta leathanbhanda.

Within the contract, there is provision for early termination on both sides, and there are details around that.  At this stage, we have no reason to expect that NBI will do anything other than continue to deliver the contract in full within the seven years for the maximum amount of money that was agreed.  The figure of &euro;2.1 billion is a maximum payment rather than a fixed payment.<\/p>  <p>  There are milestone payments.  The structure of the payments within this contract has been carefully detailed.  The contractor is paid for the work that is done as we go along.  For each number of homes connected, it receives a particular bonus.  If it does not connect the homes, it does not receive any money.  That is the structure of the contract.  It is not such that the contractor will continue to receive payments month on month or year on year without delivering on its contract.  Its payments are strictly linked.<\/p>  <p>  There has been an impact from Covid-19.  It has slowed the contractor down.  It has made it several months later than it should be.  However, that is not the entire story.  Part of the problem is the contractor's fault.  Part of the delay comes simply from the natural things that happen within the roll-out of a large contract, whereby there will be a period of time where you are developing momentum and becoming more skilled.  I would expect that at least a portion of the delays are the fault of NBI.  It may believe it is the fault of its subcontractors and may try to attribute blame, but that does not excuse it because it is not in a position to abdicate its responsibility.  It must take responsibility, even in a situation where it has delegated authority for some of its functions.

My concerns are slightly more micro than the business model.  There is a community in east Mayo that is very entrepreneurial but also has many families living in it.  Within this community there are three home-grown companies that export internationally.  We have been working with NBI for some time to try to get a sense of when a fibre connection will go into these companies and into the community.  This community recently lost all its banking services so we are told to do that online as well as access all Government services through <i>gov.ie<\/i>.  NBI came back and told us it will be done between January 2025 and December 2026.  That is not a window; that is a conservatory.  That shows a lack of ambition.<\/p><p>I am concerned we are coming up to the last week of January and we do not have a sense of what connections will happen in 2022.  The Covid excuse has to finish now.  NBI keeps telling us it is working on the ground and we keep getting emails saying it is in our area, but the reality for this community is that jobs could be lost.  One company wants to invest in an enterprise resource planning, ERP, system, which is a state-of-the-art technical system, and has a major investment plan but cannot do that because it cannot even get an interaction with National Broadband Ireland about its service.  The complaint of this community is replicated across Mayo.  Businesses are struggling nationwide.  There is also an issue whereby, because this community is in an NBI area, even though there is an Eir cable going through the community and along the road, it cannot be connected because NBI might get to it in a two-year window between 2025 and 2026.  What urgency is there?  In the context of the Government's plans around remote broadband hubs and remote working, has the Minister of State engaged with NBI about putting more urgency into this delivery?  Instead of getting so much spin and so much material, can we start to challenge NBI on what it is delivering on the ground?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700030#FF00600","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1643289900,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I recognise there is huge and growing demand for fibre broadband across Ireland, much more than there was two years ago due to the pandemic.

A proportion of those homes are due to be connected in years 6 and 7, that is, 2025 and 2026.  I can understand that people will be disappointed if they are in an area that is due in 2025 or 2026.  That is not true of the whole of Mayo.  A total of 11,373 homes have been surveyed in Mayo already and 4,033 are under construction, so they will have their service within a matter of months.  Mayo is not one single deployment area but multiple deployment areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what I can do to liaise with NBI.  I am taking a very hands-on approach.  I have been in nearly every county in Ireland in the past year.  I have met the chief executive of NBI, Peter Hendrick, on many occasions.  I also attended the two most recent board meetings of NBI.  I facilitated a meeting between NBI and Eir's chief executive and chair to ensure I understood what communications there were between the main subcontractor and the contractor itself.  I am examining everything we can do to accelerate the project.  My absolute focus is on getting the volume of connections up to a point where the project is back on track.  It is not okay that we were six months behind after the pandemic and then more months behind because of other delays, or that we announced a number at one point and then had to announce a smaller number within two months.  That is going to inspire pessimism in people but I am optimistic.  This happens with projects.  There is sometimes a valley of doom period where you are very optimistic at the start but then people start to lose faith because they come across all the real-world problems, such as blocked ducts, phone lines that are down, and rivers and railway lines that have to be crossed.  We will overcome that, we will accelerate, rejoin and get every home in Ireland connected to fibre-optic broadband.

That is absolutely a fear with any infrastructure project.  That is probably the idea that those who drafted or agreed the contract had in mind to use a private company to subcontract it out so that the risk would be transferred.  The company only receives money when it does things.  There were some subsidy payments for setting up the network originally and for various milestones met and now they only get money when they connect homes.  That is how the risk is reduced.  They have a big incentive to connect as many homes as possible.  When they connect a home they get a subsidy payment but they also get payment for anybody who connects to the network - they get a revenue stream.  They have an incentive, not only to get the fibre to go past people's homes but also to get them to take up the service.<\/p>  <p>  We have paid out &euro;177.5 million in subsidy so far.  The maximum subsidy we have agreed to pay out is &euro;2.1 billion.  The Deputy can see that is the proportion spent so far.  We have another &euro;480 million in contingency funds, which was in the budget but not in the contract.  The company has no entitlement to that but the Government has that in its budget if it needs to find some other way if it comes across unforeseen problems or for some reason it needs extra money on the project.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked whether the investors are in this for the long haul.  NBI can decide that it wants to bring in new investors with the consent of the Minister.

In the cul-de-sac where I live, there are 40 homes and, during the pandemic, only two of us, namely, a nurse and I, were going into work.  The rest all worked from home.  Many of them will continue doing so, and rightly so because it is a great option for them.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we have seen the impact on the strength of the connection.  When between 60 and 80 people in a small cul-de-sac are all online at the same time, there will be a drain.  This is an area with nominally strong coverage but the issue will become a phenomenon.  We want people to work remotely and from home, not just outside Dublin but in suburban Dublin in particular.  What efforts can be made to partner more effectively with the commercial providers to ensure those gaps will be filled?  There is a cul-de-sac in Ballinteer where the connection is perfectly fine for houses on one side of the road, while on the other side, there is zero chance of making any calls with video and so on, something that is increasingly important to so many people working in a range of areas for global employers.

Moreover, there is a limit to how much money can be paid out under that compensation scheme for encroachment.<\/p>  <p>  I would prefer homes to receive two options of broadband.

It just does not make sense to me.

I wish to raise two items, one in regard to the deployment areas and the second in regard to delivery of service.  There is a situation just outside Castlebar where some premises are in a precarious position, with some townlands ready to go live, whereas, just across the road, there are house owners who have been informed it will be 2025 or 2026 before they get connected.  My understanding is that the roll-out would be very much based on a hub and spoke model, with the roll-out progressing outwards from the urban areas.  In this case, it certainly does not feel like a hub and spoke model.<\/p>  <p>  In Breaffy, which is on the outskirts of Castlebar, there are 77 premises ready for pre-order and another 27 premises which have surveys pending, along with another segment of 118 premises.  It appears there are three separate deployment areas in the one townland and all moving at different paces.  One can imagine the frustration when people talk to their neighbours in regard to who is connected and who is not.  It is similar in other villages and townlands.  In Manulla, for example, there are 257 premises where it seems nothing will happen any time soon and surveys are still pending.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to get the Minister of State's understanding on this issue because we constantly hear the beat of the drum about the NBI website in terms of people entering their Eircode and looking for more information.  It infuriates people when they cannot even get access to the website.  I ask that we address the issue around the deployment areas, which is an important one.<\/p>  <p>  Second, on the delivery element, there is the issue of annoyance for people around the pace and the resistance of NBI to either provide information or even to engage with public representatives.  I put in a request to NBI on 7 December in regard to County Mayo and it was 27 January before I got a response, even excluding the two weeks at Christmas.  However, I did get the information eventually and I want to put that on the record of the House.<\/p>  <p>  The information related to the 37,758 premises covered under the contract.  It is a significant amount of work and it is the third-largest customer base for NBI after Cork and Galway.  Of that, 3,348 are currently available for pre-order, which is roughly 9% of the plan.  They are located on the outskirts of Ballina and Castlebar, with 1,464 for Ballina and 1,884 for Castlebar.  In Mayo, there are 696 with the network built or in progress, which is 1.8% overall.  There are 3,726 premises that have their engineering surveys under way, which is 10.1% of the planned intervention.  Over 6,442 premises have their engineering survey planned, which is 17% of the planned interventions.  Although I am running out of speaking time, I want to put this information on the record of the House.  That leaves over 22,564 premises out of the 36,758 with the engineering survey pending.<\/p> <p>How will efforts be significantly ramped up to get a large proportion of premises surveyed?

That is a consequence of the design.  Part of the design is that construction happens in every county simultaneously.  That was a political decision at the start.  From an engineering point of view, one might have started in one place and gone outwards, but it was decided that construction would happen everywhere for equity.  How do we speed it up?  Do we need more resources?  I visited the headquarters of KN Network Services and asked if it wanted the Government to be involved in training more people for installation.  I have spoken to all the different commercial providers, to the subcontractors of NBI, and to NBI.  There are problems getting staff and training people in every sector of the economy.

Most citizens feel that they are being bled, as if they are some kind of gombeens, for more than &euro;3 billion of taxpayers' money through a series of convoluted company and corporate structures that hoodwink us into believing that, somehow, this will be done quickly and efficiently.  In 2010, the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced the roll-out of a broadband plan with great aplomb.

The contract was agreed in 2019, a year before I took office, and it is my role as Minister of State to implement what is in the contract.  The benefits of the contract are huge and very ambitious.  They are no less than to bring fibre-optic broadband to every home, farm and business premises in the entire country.  We know from the past two years that this is like providing an extremely basic utility that allows rural villages and towns to be revitalised, to become vibrant again and to bring jobs into them in a way that we had never considered previously.  In the past, if we wanted to bring jobs or study places into a village or a town, we had to think about building a factory.  Now, people are returning to their home towns, working there, bringing money there, and returning to their family locations because of fibre-optic broadband.<\/p>  <p>  Some 55,000 families in Ireland can now apply for fibre-optic broadband in the intervention area.  Deputy Catherine Murphy tells me that another 45,000 can get fibre-optic broadband from Eir in that area too.

It is interesting that much of the information about corporate structures of this project was not known to us.  We now know that there is a network of at least 13 companies across Ireland, Luxembourg and the US.  We know that David McCourt's firm only owns approximately 10% of NBI despite all these convoluted corporate structures.  The map of the structures for the plan and the companies that are in it puts the London Underground in the ha'penny place.  I do not see how the Minister of State can understand it or grasp it.

It is a basic service that allows for a better quality of life.  That is why I am happy to stand over it.  Regarding investors and the complex structure, the financial structure of the company has not changed since the contract was signed.  It is a matter of public record.  It is right that people examine it and ask questions and query it, but the main investors continue to be Granahan McCourt, Tetrad Corporation, Oak Hill Advisors, Twin Point Capital and shareholders from the management team of NBI.

It is large, seven-year contract but it is my understanding that the majority of connections will be made within the first five years.  The contract was signed in 2019 but we have had Covid for the past two years, which has been very disruptive.  That said, a lot of people realised during Covid how important it is to have a proper broadband connection in their homes.  They could see it first-hand when they could not work from home because they did not have broadband.  It created huge problems.

I ask for detailed information to be provided, even if that meant that people were being told they would be connected in 2024, 2025 or 2026.

The company does not really know what is going to be in a duct underground until it opens it up.  NBI has said that it has found that the ducts are in worse condition than expected, based on its initial survey of sections of the network and that many ducts are blocked.  Eir has had a large number of owners over a relatively short period.  Some of those owners were short term and they did not invest for the long term and as a result, the Eir network requires a lot of investment.  The company is committed to that.

Let us call a spade a spade here.  It is time for Eir to wake up and smell the roses.  It must come to the table because it is getting a hell of a lot of money out of this contract.  It must make sure that it does not put any impediments in the way of progress and, indeed, remove any impediments that do exist.<\/p>  <p>  When Eir was setting out to provide broadband connections to houses in rural Ireland, it connected in circles but left large pockets unconnected, where 100 m would have made the difference between connecting houses and not connecting them.  That is the way Eir left it and that is why we have a national broadband plan.  That is why the State has to do this.  We need to be a bit more forthright and rather than just talking to Eir, we need to point out that it has a responsibility to the people of Ireland to make sure that its infrastructure is right.  It is getting a hell of a lot of money out of this contract.

It is very important that people in rural Ireland are given assurances that there will be no impediments to progress.  If ducts have collapsed, they must be fixed.  Surveys were done two years ago.  NBI personnel were out in their vans, assessing the quality of the infrastructure.  We need to move fast to remove any impediments that exist.  There must also be a better working arrangement between Eir and NBI to relieve any blockages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700036#MM00500","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1643293500,"counter":424,"content":"<p>The Deputy has identified a key difference between the national broadband plan and the commercial delivery of connectivity, which is the reason the NBP was developed.  When commercial providers such as Siro, Eir, or Virgin, for example, go around the country to connect homes, they connect the low-hanging fruit, the commercially-viable and easy-to-access homes.  Once they meet something that makes connection not worth it such as a railway line, a river or some other obstacle, they just go up another road instead.  As the Deputy said, this has meant that lots of people all over the country were left out.  NBI does not have that option.  This is a universal service and NBI has to connect every home in the deployment area to get the payment.  The threshold is 100%, which makes it much harder.  The cost is much higher than the cost per home of the delivery of the previous commercial providers.  That is the essential difference between commercial and non-commercial provision.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy pointed out that a large proportion of the subvention money is to go to Eir as a subcontractor but that money will go out over 25 years.  NBI will take in revenue by way of charges on people who have connected to the network.<\/p>  <p>The major part of the income from NBI will not be from the State but from the people who are being provided with a service.  The company will use that money to pay Eir for the rental of its poles and ducts over a period of 25 years.  It is giving Eir a long-term future for its rural broadband network.  All the unblocking of ducts, putting up new poles and replacing old ones is investment and strengthening its network.  From Eir's perspective, this also makes sense.  We need to ensure that these incentives are properly aligned.  Eir gets a long-term future for its rural network and, at the same, time people living in rural Ireland are able to get fibre-optic broadband through NBI.  That is the alignment of the two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700036#MM00600","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643294100,"counter":426,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned other providers and low-lying fruit.

I understand that the Starlink service is able to operate without a licence at the moment and is now deploying, and that people can opt for it.  It is expensive.  It is many times the cost of getting a fibre-optic broadband connection, which is typically &euro;100 for connection and then &euro;35 a month whereas a low-earth orbit satellite might cost &euro;500 upfront and &euro;100 a month.

It is something that I became interested in from a community and voluntary perspective before I entered politics.  We brought wireless-operated broadband to Goleen in Mizen Head, the last parish in Ireland, 15 or 16 years ago.  We know some little thing about it; I am not trying to say that I am an expert.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that it is moving quickly.  I think it is moving at snail's pace.  The delivery of broadband in west Cork in places such as Innishannon, which is very close to Cork city, as is Kilmacsimon, Bandon, Bantry, Coomhola, Clonakilty, Timoleague; I could go on naming them forever.  People are coming to me from areas where there are maybe 20 or 25 houses who cannot get connected to the fibre-optic cable that is there.<\/p>  <p>  The issue I want to focus on is the wireless operators.  The Minister of State said he was very optimistic; I said I am not.  He said he was looking at every solution.  Has he sat down and spoken to the wireless operators who can immediately provide broadband to the areas that he might be looking to provide broadband to in five years?  He should forget about five years.  I have been asking for people to get broadband for ten years.  It is not happening.  We hear four years, five or six years and I feel like it the time is getting longer every time we sit down around the table.  These are the same communities that were promised this eight years ago.  Let me take Baltimore.  DigitalForge, Fasttrack Broadband and similar companies in west Cork were able to provide wireless broadband to places such as Baltimore.  When Eir came to town with fibre, no one wanted to leave DigitalForge.  They had a private operator and if there was ever a problem, they could pick up the phone and it was resolved straight away.  It can offer something between 70 or 100 Mbs or maybe for a business it can offer more on a wireless setting.  That can be offered anywhere in rural Ireland but they need to be funded.  <\/p>  <p>  Has the Minister of State opened communication with them?  From what I can tell, we will be left with 5% of houses in rural Ireland that will not get a fibre connection.  Who is going to connect them?  The other problem is that the wireless operator is out there working his butt off trying to survive.  He is providing the service to the town so that he can give broadband to the rural communities.  The wireless operators are coming in and taking the rich pickings in the town.  They are pulling all the town customers away from them.  My worry is that they will pull the plug and in a year or two, many rural communities that had broadband will no longer have it because the wireless operator has been taken out.<\/p> <p>Has the Minister of State put in protections to ensure those rural communities will continue to be connected?  Has he sat down with the wireless operators since he came into office?  What solutions does he have at present that he can tell us about?  I have only two minutes left so I would appreciate it if he could answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700037#NN00800","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643294700,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I take his point about wireless operators.  I have spoken to some such operators, but now that he says it, I could speak to more.  It is a good point.  Typically in rural Ireland, broadband is provided by a fixed wireless operator.  Somebody erects a mast and it covers the valley.  When I stayed in Ballydehob, I was able to get a perfectly good service from a wireless operator, so I understand.  The idea with NBI is that when fibre comes to the area, the wireless operator can write to all their customers and say it is switching them over to fibre and it can take a payment as a reseller for the fibre in that area.  Any of the wireless operator's customers who want to switch can do so and anyone who wants to continue can do that.  I think the point the Deputy is making is that somebody might turn off their wireless service.  Is that what he was saying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700038#OO00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1643294700,"counter":435,"content":"<p>The whole point is that, first, it does not look like the Minister of State has engaged properly with them.  I respect that since he has plenty of time to do that in the days and hours ahead.  The bottom line is we need to support the existing wireless operators.  It was the same with previous Ministers.  Nobody seems to care about this.  The existing wireless operator can offer broadband down in the valley that nobody else will be able to offer for the next five years.  He can put a base station at the top of the hill and it will reflect.  That is why the Minister of State got broadband when he was in Ballydehob.  I live in Schull, which is the town next to it.  This is what DigitalForge and others have been doing out there.  They have been providing broadband years and years ahead.  What are we doing?  We will tell the rest of the country to hang on for five years because the fibre will be coming and if it does they can tie into the fibre.  Forget the fibre.  For many people wireless is the way forward at present.<\/p>  <p>  I need the Minister of State to talk to the wireless operators and find that solution.  He needs to find that solution for the people who, five years down the line, are not going to be connected and who cannot come home and work and cannot come home and live.

It is our window to the world of work, of education, of health, of leisure and just general family catch-up. <\/blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately, this highlights again the big urban-rural divide.  We have parts of Ireland that still have no broadband connection.  A recent survey conducted by <i>switcher.ie<\/i>found towns and cities have broadband speeds up to 36 times faster than some rural parts of Ireland.  We are currently waiting for 2 million premises to be connected to the NBI network and 18% of Irish homes still have no network.  If we can look at broadband as a way of dispersing masses to less-populated areas, this would make many rural towns and villages more sustainable.<\/p><p>I am just going to roll back to when we were talking about front-line workers and providers who protected us through Covid-19.  I received another email during the week from concerned businesses based in a business park in Kilmallock.  Among these is Irema, which supplied masks to the health service throughout Ireland.  It supplied masks to everyone to try to protect us.  Irema does not have broadband.  It is a massive employer in Kilmallock yet it does not have broadband.  When we asked the company to step up to the plate to help and protect us, it did so.  It asked the Government to give it broadband.  There are other firms in that area.  An Post is in the same business park.  Dansko Foods has invested in the same business park and it does not have broadband.  If you go to the other side of Kilmallock, Keltec Engineering does not have broadband.  I can see that within 100 yards there is broadband.  When these firms enquire about it, they are given phone numbers and told they will have it by 2025 or 2026.  It is 100 yards away.  I am in construction all my life.  If you gave a person a shovel he or she would have it dug in a month, so I could do it in a digger within a day.

It means that as things change and the roll-out progresses, if it is found that something will be later or earlier, that person will get an email stating that his or her connection date has changed, been revised and the revised connection date.

I know many of the contractors - not the main contractors or the subcontractor - but a lot of the ordinary hedge-cutting contractors that do the different types of work related to broadband provision.  I can tell the Minister of State what is going on out there because seemingly people do not realise it.  When it comes to hedge cutting, the minimum is being done and there will be problems in a year or two.  The way it was measured with Eir, which will not throw money at you, the surveying that was done was unbelievable.  I do not know where it got some of the engineers that did the surveying, but the hedge cutting that is going on and the way it is being priced means that contractors are walking away from it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State does not see this, but for the ordinary people who are doing the work out there on the ground there are savage problems that are not being recognised.  It is about time that the Department officials went out to talk to the ordinary Joe Soap, not the guys in the suits who are going around bluffing, and some other word I would use - BS - to people, but the guys who are out there doing the work.  They have done it for years with the likes of Eir and, as I said, Eir would not throw money at you, no way.  I would never say that, but as bad as it was, it was cutting.  There are certain heights even under the line now; that is the way it has gone.  If a hedge-cutting contractor misses a piece, or if he or she only does a certain piece, then that contractor does not get paid for that.  The way it is being done is absolutely horrendous because down the road a machine will have to be put in again to cut it.<\/p>  <p>  I am taking up Deputy Harkin's time, but I ask the Minister of State to try to get someone to talk to the ordinary people who are doing the work on the ground.  I understand about the blockages and everything.  Contractors should be permitted by councils - they should not have to get licences and all that.  I ask the Minister of State to go out to look at that.

That would be mid-2024.  If we talk about 90%, Leitrim County Council has confirmed that more than 90% of Leitrim properties requiring intervention in the national broadband plan will not be connected until 2025 or 2026.  I looked at the figures for Sligo and saw that by the end of this year it will be approximately 16% and at the end of 2023 it will be about one third, but for 2025 to 2026, 60% of all premises will still not be connected.  I have listened to the debate and I heard the Minister of State saying that people would like broadband tomorrow.

I thank the D&aacute;il for the invitation to address it on the roll-out of the historic national broadband plan.  I reaffirm to the House that this plan remains a top priority for the Government.  I am sure that this House strongly supports the overarching objective of the programme to deliver a high-speed broadband fibre network to more than 554,000 premises, 1.1 million people, over 100,000 farms and non-farm businesses and some 679 schools.  The national broadband plan high-speed broadband map is available on the Department's website at <i>broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.  The amber area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP, State-led intervention.<\/p><p>The NBP contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland in November 2019 to ensure that 100% of the premises in the State have access to reliable, high-quality, high-speed broadband.<\/p> <p>It will offer users a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500 Mbps from the outset, and with higher speeds available to businesses.  This plan is the largest infrastructure project in rural Ireland since rural electrification.  It spans 96% of Ireland's land mass and it will bring high-speed broadband to 69% of Ireland's total number of farms.  It will deliver fast reliable broadband through laying 140,000 km of fibre cable, utilising more than 1.5 million poles and more than 15,000 km of underground duct networks.<br\/><br\/>I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying and e-health and, more recently, staying in touch with family members during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The pandemic has caused profound socioeconomic change and has brought to the fore the central role digital connectivity and technology can play in transforming the way we work and connect with each other.  The pandemic has highlighted, now more than ever, the importance of current and future connectivity needs, not only in city centres but also across our suburbs, towns and rural communities.  Ireland will be a world leader in fibre broadband roll-out by 2026.<br\/><br\/>A key principle of the national broadband plan is to support and stimulate commercial investment.  Since the publication of the NBP strategy in 2012, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested in excess of &euro;3.3 billion in upgrading and modernising networks that support the provision of high-speed broadband and mobile telecommunications services.  Extensive investment plans are in place by a range of operators in commercial areas.  Eir has stated it will roll out fibre to the home to a further 1.6 million premises in urban areas, bringing its overall fibre to the home deployment to approximately 1.9 million premises.  Meanwhile, SIRO is completing the first phase of its fibre deployment and to date has passed more than 400,000 premises with gigabit services.  It has recently announced plans to extend that network to an additional 320,000 premises.  Virgin Media Ireland has also recently announced a &euro;200 million upgrade of its network to full fibre to the more than 1 million premises the company covers over the next three years.  Many other network operators and telecommunications service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.<br\/><br\/>Today, more than 2.4 million or 77% of premises in Ireland can access commercially available high-speed broadband services of more than 30 Mbps.  In the 2021 digital economy and society index, DESI, for the 27 EU countries, Ireland performed well.  It ranked fifth with a score of 60.3, which is well above the EU average of 50.7.  NBI will address the remaining premises through the national broadband plan State intervention.  As recently as six years ago, Ireland had a fibre to the home, FTTH, network of less than 1% of the 1.7 million broadband subscriptions.  Latest figures from the ComReg report for quarter 3 of 2021 show that fibre to the home subscriptions are now at 340,000 or 20% of the 1.7 million subscriptions, and growing.  This upward trajectory has been achieved through a combination of commercial investment and State intervention.<br\/><br\/>Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on the delivery of the new high-speed fibre broadband network under the national broadband plan.  NBI commenced connections to the new fibre network in January 2021, which is just 12 months ago.  As of today, more than 54,000 premises are available for order and pre-order for high-speed fibre broadband across 21 counties, including Carlow, Clare, Cavan, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.  NBI has advised that in excess of 154,000 premises are constructed or under construction, demonstrating that the project is reaching scale.  More than 5,400 premises have been connected as of 14 January and this figure is increasing weekly.  To date, the level of connections is in line with projections and in some areas it is exceeding expectations.<br\/><br\/>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network, resulting in delays in the delivery of aspects of the programme.  Impacts include challenges with the mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations and supply chain, as well as logistical delays, both nationally and internationally.  In addition, there have been challenges with the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with onboarding and training people.  Like all of us, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid-19 or may have had to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact.  This impact continues to be felt due to the current more contagious Omicron variant.<br\/><br\/>With a project of the scale of the NBP, it can be difficult for media commentary to communicate fully the scale of activity or work completed in terms of delivery of the NBP.  I will share with Deputies some details of what has been achieved against the backdrop of challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic to date.  Some 6 million metres of cable have been installed; 25,000 telegraph poles have been remediated or newly installed; 152,000 premises have been submitted to Open Eir for the &quot;make ready&quot; programme; 250 section 254 applications have been submitted across all 31 local authorities, with 154 approved; 38 deployment area designs have been approved by the Department; more than 150,000 premises in 45 deployment areas are either under build or build-completed across 26 counties; six deployment areas are now fully build-completed, with four more deployment areas nearing completion; three island deployment areas with build are under way; 26 local exchanges with Nokia equipment have been installed and are ready for network connectivity; 54,000 premises are available to order or pre-order across 21 counties, as well as three islands off the coast of Donegal; 34,417 premises are available to order by 31 January 2022; 7,355 orders have been received by retail service providers; 5,477 connections have been completed across 11 counties, with 1,300 connections made in December 2021 alone; 453 broadband connection points have been installed; and 50 retail service providers, RSPs, have been contracted, with 34 of those onboarded.  The ongoing investment in the roll-out is also creating employment opportunities.  Some 292 direct employees and 911 indirect employees working with build and design contractors are now employed on foot of the NBP investment, with this number rising weekly as construction activity ramps up.<br\/><br\/>Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the NBP.  They are located in areas of community importance, allowing local residents to quickly get free public access to high-speed broadband in advance of fibre deployment under the national broadband plan.  BCPs are a key support for promoting balanced regional development as part of a sustainable and equitable post-pandemic recovery and will enable rural communities to avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy.  BCPs have been developed to become digitally enabled community assets.  Activities currently under way include the establishment of remote working facilities at a significant number of locations, remote e-health consultation booth pilot projects, digital skills training for children and young people, and a national BCP film festival that will be screened at BCPs.<br\/><br\/>As of 14 January, some 453 BCP sites in total have been installed by NBI and 255 of the publicly available sites are now connected with high-speed broadband service through a service provider contract with Vodafone.  As part of this initiative, primary school BCPs are also being provided with high-speed broadband for educational use through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Education.  To date, 185 schools have been installed, out of the total of 453 BCP sites, with high-speed broadband for educational access and 99 schools are now connected.  An acceleration of this aspect of the national broadband plan will see some 679 schools connected to high-speed broadband well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  That is every primary school in the country.<br\/><br\/>The House will be aware of recent commentary on the ownership structure of NBI and parliamentary questions answered by me on this issue in the D&aacute;il in December.  I can confirm the ownership structure of NBI remains as advised to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications at contract award in November 2019 and at the effective date of the contract on 9 January 2020.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has rights of consent under the project agreement in respect of changes in ownership, and NBI must notify the Minister in advance of any such event arising.  There have been no subsequent notifications of changes to ownership or control.<br\/><br\/>It is usual with large-scale projects of this nature that the investors' investment in the project is structured through tiered holding companies.  NBI applies the highest standards to its corporate governance and the structures adopted by it are typical of investments in critical infrastructure not only in Ireland but globally where investors of international reach and scale are involved.  As the roll-out progresses, I will ensure Members of the House are kept up to date.  The Department will continue to arrange Oireachtas stakeholder information sessions for Deputies and Senators, of which, I am pleased to note, 21 sessions were facilitated in the past six months.<br\/><br\/>Citizens can also obtain information on specific areas in the intervention area through the NBI website.  This site provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register its interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website,\u00a0.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates relating to their own premises as works commence.  Furthermore, NBI has a dedicated email address,\u00a0<i>reps@nbi.ie<\/i>, which can be used by Oireachtas Members for specific queries.  NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.<br\/><br\/>The national broadband plan will deliver high-speed broadband to every premises in Ireland.  The Government remains committed to the speedy and effective roll-out of high-speed broadband that is future-proofed for the next 25 years and beyond.<\/p> <p>It is frustrating for everyone that the early stages of the network build have faced challenges.  I am disappointed that the programme is behind schedule but I assure my colleagues that I am determined, as is everyone working on this in the Department, to continue to drive an acceleration of the network build programme with the aim of getting it back on track.  <\/p> <p> The ambition of Ireland's NBP is an exemplar.  The Government investment in the NBP, along with the investment by commercial operators in their fibre build programmes, will mean that before the end of this decade Ireland will be the leader in the EU in fibre to the home connectivity.  The NBP will ensure that every home, business and farm in the State has access to high-speed broadband connectivity.  The NBP will transform where people choose to live and how we work.  The short-term challenges of the network build will be overcome and the long-term impact of this programme will be truly life-changing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700039#PP02400","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643296500,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his remarks in respect of this issue.  Broadband is one of the key pieces of infrastructure, particularly for all of rural Ireland and indeed for a lot of urban Ireland as well.  We always come across people who tell us this is not just a rural problem.  There are many areas of the country, even in towns and larger towns, that have difficulties getting stable broadband connection.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the pandemic has brought challenges for all of us.  I respect and understand the effect it has had on getting work done, delivery times and all of that.  However, most of us would also accept that there were delays to the roll-out anyway, even without Covid-19.  There were serious issues and problems there anyway.  The national broadband roll-out has been slow and difficult.  It has not been delivered to the standard the vast majority of the public expected up to now.  That is something we need to acknowledge.  We need to do something about it to ensure people get the broadband delivery they require.<\/p>  <p>  If one has adequate broadband, particularly fibre broadband, one is in the centre of the commercial world no matter where one is.  That is the difference it makes for an awful lot of people, particularly those who have become accustomed to the concept of working from home or a hybrid model of work.  Adequate broadband is essential for that.  I live in a rural area in the rural constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  I could mention multiple areas where there are issues.  The previous question-and-answer session included Deputies referring to their little towns and areas and the problems they have had.  There are many small issues in small areas.  Consider a company that employs eight people in a town where the broadband comes to a certain point, 200 m away from where the company is based, and it cannot find anyone to bring it that extra couple of hundred yards up the road.  The owners of that company would feel frustrated, annoyed and betrayed by a system that cannot do that for them.  When that is multiplied by the hundreds of people around the country who have had similar experiences, it creates a problem for the Government.  The impression people have is that the Government is letting them down and not delivering for them.  That needs to be acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  I also took note of what Deputy Michael Collins said about the many providers, including satellite providers and providers putting up a mast on a hill and delivering a service.  Without those providers, an awful lot of rural areas would be completely lost.  One of the fears of many rural communities is that as fibre broadband is rolled out to the more populated areas, those companies that were providing services to both more populated and less populated areas will simply withdraw the service and the less populated areas will be left without any service at all.  That needs to be examined closely.  I heard the comments the Minister of State made earlier to the effect that he will engage with those providers.  That engagement needs to happen as quickly as possible to ensure we now have full delivery of broadband to every house we can possibly reach in the country.  In areas that have access now, we must ensure they maintain it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700041#RR00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1643296500,"counter":488,"content":"<p>The delivery of high-speed broadband is crucial to our ability to grow the economy, particularly in the context of regional development.  As a Deputy who represents a rural constituency, I know the lack of broadband connectivity is having negative impacts on the ability of rural communities to remain sustainable.  The work of NBI is vital.  It was reported recently that NBI is once again going to miss its target for access to high-speed Internet for homes and businesses.  The target was 60,000.  It had been revised down from an original target of 115,000.  The likely output is going to be in the region of 35,000 to 40,000, which is approximately one third of the original target.  There are perhaps multiple reasons for that.  What is more important is what is planned to bring the roll-out back on track, including a timeframe for when it will be back on track.<\/p>  <p>  On the most recent occasion representatives of NBI appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in September last year, they reported they were six months behind in their work.  Has that been extended?  It will have a knock-on effect on targets for the coming year.  What is the plan to tackle that?  NBI also reported it was having licensing issues with a number of local authorities.  Is that still causing problems and delays?<\/p>  <p>  The NBI website now has a portal which maps out the different stages each area is at in the process of rolling out high-speed Internet across each county, including roll-out to houses and businesses that can now order or pre-order broadband and areas that are survey pending.  Roll-out to some areas will only happen in 2025 or 2026.  Quite a lot of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which includes north Meath, is survey pending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700041#RR00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1643296500,"counter":489,"content":"<p>On a point of order, there is no Minister on the other side of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700041#RR00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1643296500,"counter":490,"content":"<p>There is a Minister.

There are a number of small gaps in rural areas around Shercock and Virginia, to name but two.  An extremely large part of west Cavan is not covered by the map.  I was recently contacted by a man from Ballyconnell who told me he has two daughters who were doing college exams in the first week of January.  They were doing those exams online and when they were submitting their papers, the Internet dropped for one of the daughters.  She got it back up and running and submitted her paper with three minutes to spare.  That sort of thing is putting considerable stress on people.<\/p>  <p>  There is also massive frustration and, at times, anger in rural Ireland when people see that their neighbour across the road or a short distance up the road has broadband and they do not.  People have told me there is high-speed fibre broadband a quarter of a mile up the road from their home and a quarter of a mile down the road from their home and the two or three houses in the middle are left with none.  Those people have no reception whatsoever.  They are annoyed.  The frustration and anger is worse when such people see that according to the NDP, there is nothing planned for the area in which they live.

I recently contacted Eir about River Towers, an apartment block on Lee Road in Cork city that is waiting for a fibre to the home connection.  Eir informed me it could not give me a date for delivery but that it will be done by 2026, which is four years from now.  That is astounding.  In Cork city, the second city in this State, there is an apartment block without fibre high-speed broadband.  Eir could not give me a date for connection because of ComReg's decision D10\/18.  I think it is fair to say that when ComReg came up with these decisions, we were not in the same space or time as we are now.  We are now reliant on broadband to allow people to work from home or engage in education, as my colleague, Deputy Tully, said.  Will the Minister of State instruct ComReg to look at that and review it, given the impact the lack of broadband has on jobs and people's ability to work from home and move employment?  There also needs to be an investigation into whether a compromise can be found to allow people to get a timeline for delivery so they know they will be waiting for six months or a year.  Four years is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Not having access to high-speed broadband has a considerable impact on people's lives.  It limits job opportunities, isolates people from family members who are abroad and reduces their entertainment possibilities.  In particular, during the pandemic, we found out how important broadband is for students, whether in primary school, secondary school or third level.  That is why broadband is vital and needs to be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  From household security systems to baby monitors, so much technology now relies on a high-speed Internet connection and yet many of my constituents are being told they are going to have to wait until 2026 to have proper Internet in their homes.  It is 2022.  People cannot use Zoom for work, education or involvement in community groups and services.  The NBP is failing people.  They are so frustrated.  I have heard other Deputies talking about the lack of high-speed Internet in their own constituencies.<\/p> <p>This is not just a rural Ireland problem; it is a national problem.  We can have an apartment block in the city without broadband.  There are many other areas.  In Clogheen and Kerry Pike, which are 2 km from Apple, one of the biggest computer companies in the world, there are areas with no Internet coverage or limited coverage.  The town of Blarney, which is 6 km from Cork city, is the same, as are Watergrasshill, Donoughmore, upper Glanmire and Whitechurch.  I have a list of areas in my constituency that either have no broadband connection, or parts of those areas have no broadband connection.<\/p> <p> I am asking the Minister of State about this because the current system for the provision of broadband and Internet connections is failing people.  Something needs to be done.  I ask him to speak to ComReg to see whether we can give people proper timelines.  It is all about information.  This is the information age and we cannot give people the information they need.

There are huge challenges, however.  Like my colleague from Cork North-Central, I want to convey my concerns about the constituency.  Cork is the second biggest city in the country and huge areas now are on the schedule for 2025-26.  That is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  We also have a problem whereby Eir is providing broadband on one side of the road and people on the other side cannot get access to it.  I know of one case - one of many - where the pole that the cable is attached to is on the entrance to a particular house.  Eir will not provide the broadband to that house yet it will take it 200 yards down the road and provide it to another house.  That is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I wish to raise relates to area hubs.  We have rolled out these hubs in quite a number of places in my area, including Courtbrack and Whitechurch.  We need hubs in other areas, in particular where there will be a delay in the roll-out of broadband from house to house.  We need hubs in communities.  I have raised three specific areas with Cork County Council and the various authorities: Glenville, Inniscarra community centre and Mourneabbey.  These are areas in which a huge number of houses do not have access to broadband.  In Inniscarra, for instance, there are more than 900 children in primary school yet huge sections of that parish do not have access to broadband.  If 900 children are in primary school, another 900 children from that area are either in college or secondary school.  We have no broadband in quite a number of parts of that parish.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be far more proactive with the providers where broadband is in the boundary zone.  Why are we applying the rules strictly to the boundary when houses are within a very short distance of where the supply is going?  It is something we need to resolve very fast.  Many things have changed over the Covid-19 period.  It has created huge problems for people and huge difficulties for families.  It is now accepted that more people will be working from home.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue I wish to raise is in relation to new housing estates.  We are not applying adequate pressure with regard to new housing estates being built.  One cannot build an estate unless one has a road, a water supply and a sewerage connection yet we will not make it a condition that an estate must also have a broadband connection.  The delay in getting broadband into new housing estates is not good enough.  We should have it far faster.  It should be there the day the keys are handed over to the purchaser.  People should not have to wait 12, 18 or 24 months to get a broadband connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700042#SS00200","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1643297100,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on broadband.  The issue is that broadband is the great enabler for rural Ireland.  In many of the debates we had a number of years ago, we looked at broadband to try to have connectivity within rural Ireland.  In the intervening two years, Covid-19 has shown us what rural Ireland can do.  Despite the protests of the policymakers that we should all be living centrally in smaller units, Covid-19 has shown us the benefits of our rural communities.  We should take that on board.  That has been a great lesson for us over the last two years.  By taking it on board, we must make sure the broadband issue is taken more seriously.<\/p>  <p>  In his opening remarks, the Minister of State lamented the delays that are taking place with regard to the roll-out of broadband.  It is hugely frustrating in one instance but it also hugely wrongs the entire island and all parts of this State to say that we are not taking this plan by the scruff of the neck and making sure it is happening and will happen on time.  There is nothing more fundamental than the broadband plan.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last two years, we have seen that whether people are working for State companies, employed by the State directly, employed by multinationals or working for any other number of companies, they have been working from home from the most remote areas.  In the earlier period of the lockdown in March, April and May 2020, connectivity and wireless broadband was being looked at, particularly in my area, which is a very rural community.  People were making alternative arrangements to the NBP.  It is almost as if the providers of wireless broadband have gone beyond and filled a vacancy the State has been neglecting by not rolling it out fast enough.<\/p>  <p>  We are where we are now.  We have a delay in the system but we also need to look at the challenges.  Previous speakers spoke about the inflexibility within the contracts both to Eir and the NBP.  Flexibility needs to be brought in it.  Many contributors have asked for that, not only in this debate today but in debates going back over time.  I have certainly asked for it in terms of being able to name a raft of places right across my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen it with the development of community organisations and groups.  Even as late as yesterday, somebody spoke to me about accessing broadband in Aubane, Ballydaly and Glash.  In Glash and Aubane, schoolhouses that were closed in the late 1960s and early 1970s have become community hubs but they also have broadband connectivity.  People are using them because they are for the community but they also have the broadband that is necessary for people to carry out their work.  We must also make sure that is one step.  We must make sure that any new hubs that are going to be developed in villages and towns where funding is going to come from various government organisations to do the physical construction have top-quality fibre broadband and everything going for them.<\/p>  <p>  While Covid-19 has shown us what can be done in rural communities, broadband is the great enabler or leveller to ensure we have everything.  As I have said in many debates, broadband is as crucial as electricity, running water or the telephone in the late 1970s or early 1980s.  It is not being taken with the same seriousness as I would like it to be, however.  We should not be debating this again.  We should be saying that the broadband plan has started and is happening rather than saying there are delays in it.  It is totally unacceptable that there are delays.  What are the delays in the plan doing?  They are affecting decisions families are making in terms of working from home and engaging with their employers.  We will be debating the new working from home Bill in a week or so but the great enabler is broadband.<\/p> <p>We should not be saying \"well, if we had a proper broadband service\".  It should be there regardless of whether one is in the most remote part of Ireland or in the city centres.  Like water, telephone connections and electricity, broadband should be an essential part of our living today in every place.  We have debated mobile phone coverage many times.  Mobile phone coverage has been disappearing, rather than improving, over the years.  I do not see the powers that be, such as ComReg and others, that are charged with making the necessary interventions on behalf of the State, taking it as urgently as they should.  They should do so as a matter of grave urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700042#SS00300","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643297700,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Martin Browne, who will be followed by Deputy Catherine Murphy.

We all agree that it should be in new housing estates, but the Government needs to start building those houses first.<\/p>  <p>  This week, the T&aacute;naiste outlined the 13 reasons employers will be able to refuse requests to work from home.  A company will be able to do so if it has concerns regarding the Internet connectivity of the proposed remote working location.  Maybe the T&aacute;naiste should reword this to reflect the reality of the situation for a number of people who have been in contact with me.  Maybe he should include a proviso that employees should refer their requests for home working to NBI, given that the slow pace of the NBI roll-out is leaving many people without options for their work.  One man who was offered a job opportunity had to meet a requirement that his Internet connection must have a minimum 20 Mbps download speed and a minimum 10 Mbps upload speed.  When he checked his connection, he found he had nowhere near this level.  When he checked with his provider, he was told that the infrastructure was not in place.  When I inquired on his behalf, I was told that while there is no high-speed broadband at his premises at the minute, as it stands it should be connected up with a full fibre to the home connection by NBI at some stage between May and July of this year.  That is real good for him.  If the T&aacute;naiste is happy to put job prospects into the hands of NBI, he will encounter some very real problems.<\/p>  <p>  There are also issues of crossover with companies such as Eir.  A constituent contacted Eir at the end of last year when a salesman told him that fibre broadband under the NBI scheme was available to his home.  When he contacted Eir, they signed him up for an installation.  When the day arrived, they advised the customer that there was a porting issue at their end and that it got cancelled in error.  They therefore arranged another date.  The day before that date, he was told that they could not install it because the infrastructure is not in place for fibre broadband in his area.  Since then, Eir and NBI have been telling the customer that it is the fault of the other.  While this kind of problem with Eir is no surprise, it is an unacceptable way to deal with a customer and with the roll-out of a service.  <\/p>  <p>  I also have concerns for our farming community.  More and more farmers are reliant on broadband to effectively manage and resource their farms.  Indeed, at the agriculture committee, we heard of the importance of data collection and analysis, which will help to vastly improve environmental management, such as fertiliser spreading, organic manure management and crop harvesting.  There is a bit of a road to go in relation to this at the moment.  There has been a lack of clarity on the number of farms that have been connected, apart from NBI saying its ambition is to connect 54,000 farms to high-speed broadband.  If our farmers are being required to adhere to increasingly technical demands, and if we are to have the capacity to use the technological advances that have been made in recent times, the roll-out of high-speed broadband is crucial for them.  While I appreciate that some progress has been made in Tipperary, there are entire counties that have been left out altogether.  In the last six months, 28 national schools have gone live and 168 schools are now ready to connect through a retail service provider.  Some 99 of those are live out a total of 679 national schools in the intervention area.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Government agreed to a remedial plan that involved reducing the number of houses and businesses passed by the end of the year to 60,000.  I understand that the number achieved was well below that.  Given the significant amount of public money that has been pumped into the NBP, as well as all we have heard about the contract concerns - my colleague Deputy Stanley had warned about this - there needs to be greater regulation of public procurement spending on a range of capital projects about which there are questions regarding spiralling costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700043#TT00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1643297700,"counter":499,"content":"<p>There has been quite a bit of media coverage around the NBP in recent months, particularly before Christmas.  It has mainly focused on missed targets, on how very little of the investors&rsquo; own money has gone into the NBP, on how it is funded, on the complicated corporate structure and so on.  The big takeaway was about the expectation that &euro;175 million in equity was to be put in by those who won the tender.  We were told that this had been promised.  The expectation was that this equity would be put in but in fact, there has been an equity investment of just &euro;98 million so far.  That usually means the purchase of shares.  In effect, this boils down to the fact that just &euro;2 million of their own money has been put into what is the largest contract in the history of the State.  That was not my expectation.  I do not think that anybody else had that expectation either.  In essence, the money in entails lots of high-cost loans and at best no equity, while the money out entails fees and interest from those loans.  The Minister of State has just confirmed that was exactly what was expected by those who signed the contract.  It is certainly not what was conveyed here in the D&aacute;il.  A contribution of &euro;223 million, which was the total amount via loans and not share purchase, was touted prior to the contract being awarded.  The figure so far is &euro;98 million.<\/p>  <p>  I want to move on.  Of the &euro;38 million in fees paid to investors - and this has to do with when the contract was awarded - &euro;32.7 million was paid to NBI Bidco LLC, which was controlled by Granahan McCourt.  It was set up just a week before the contract was signed.  Even if it had been permitted to recoup the cost of the bid, how was it that a company which was set up a week beforehand got to claim that money?  They clearly had not incurred such a cost.  I would like a response to that, even if it is later on in writing.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and NBI insist that Granahan McCourt controls NBI and that control is determined by voting rights.  This may be true, but the contract itself states that control is determined according to who has the necessary voting rights, holds the necessary investment or is entitled to the necessary percentage of dividends.  The threshold for control is set at 30% of the contract.  While Mr. McCourt may well have 30% of the voting rights of NBI, as the Department claims, he certainly does not own 30% of the shares.  That has been clearly demonstrated by the way this is funded.  Does he actually control NBI?  If so, and if it is only based on voting rights, why does the contract suggest otherwise?  I refer the Minister of State to page 42 of the definitions in relation to that.  Why was a multimillion euro State contract given to Mr. McCourt, whose private investment firm, Granahan McCourt Capital LLC, owns just 2.7% of NBI?  Just &euro;54,674 of the money Granahan McCourt Capital LLC invested was by way of buying shares, whereas 99.1% was via debt.  I am still not satisfied with the responses that we have heard in that regard today.<\/p>  <p>  What does the contract say about the investors' obligations when it comes to capitalising NBI?  Does it allow shareholders to provide capital in the form of loans at 12% compound interest?  Is that the kind of thing that is specified?  I have asked for it to be published to the greatest degree possible, and ideally the whole lot of it.  The Minister of State has said he is looking into that at the moment.  However, it is important that we can see just exactly what was signed up to, so that we can evaluate that ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the key issue is whether the consortium can crash out at any time.  If so, what does that look like?  What do they take with them?<\/p> <p>What is the potential risk to the State?  We need a response to that.  I would be very happy to get that answer in writing because there are a lot of things to be caught up on after this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700043#TT00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643298300,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I want to talk about the lack of broadband in Mayo.

Not one home has been connected yet.  We have asked for details about the contract, such as whether there will be penalties for targets not being met or what will happen.  It reminds me of the JobPath situation and the sell-off of Eircom.  People want to know that they and their money are protected but they also want to know when they will be connected.  That is not happening at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  Third level students are trying to study from home.  We are creating such inequality through all of this and it is so unjust, particularly in rural Ireland and the west, which needs investment.  We are continuously promised jam tomorrow and told that everything will be alright next month or the month after but we are not getting anything.  I have a leaving certificate student in my house and when he switches one thing on I have to switch off another.  We cannot work like that.  So many Government essential services are delivered online at the moment, and rightly so because efficiencies can be achieved there, but the inequality that is built in by not having proper broadband connectivity is just not right.  There is a lack of transparency around what is going to happen and this House deserves to know what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the equity, we were told in the first instance what the company that was granted the contract would be investing in it and then we found out that was not true at all.  We do not know what to believe at this stage but we want broadband.  There are people with disabilities who are at home and who need connectivity because they are socially and economically excluded from society.  Target after target is not being met and we are not given an explanation for that.  We were told for a while, as we were with many other services, that this was because of Covid but I do not accept that.  This should not have been delayed with Covid because it was considered an essential service.  We in Mayo have absolutely no confidence that the targets will be reached and we are running out of patience and out of road.  We have certainly run out of broadband and connectivity.  The Minister of State informed us that the investors have already extracted millions to cover their own costs incurred during the bidding phase.  That is just not right.  There is still not a single home connected in Mayo.  I talk about Mayo but this affects so many other counties as well.  It is disingenuous for the Government to claim that the equity investment that was to be put in by the investors can mean equity or debt financing.  People want a return for the money.  They want fairness, justice and value for money.  They are certainly not getting this with regard to broadband in Mayo.

Subsequent to some further information that was brought to our attention today, there are some issues I want to highlight.  The Government put a strong focus on rolling out broadband services to areas of the country that had a severe lack of any type of infrastructure around broadband.  Community centres, with which the Minister of State would be familiar, primary schools and even some parish halls have been chosen as suitable locations for these facilities.  An issue with these facilities was brought to my attention recently.  I found it quite entertaining but it is a very valid point.  In order to access these services people must receive a text message from a mobile phone provider but not only do many of these areas not have high-speed broadband access, they also do not have phone reception.  It makes it impossible to access those services.  I said this to the representatives from NBI.  It is important that it looks at incorporating this into the national broadband plan.  That is something I would like the Minister of State to look at.  Multiple millions of euro have been invested to make this happen and it was supported by many Ministers.  The former Minister, Deputy Naughten, who is in the Chamber, did a lot of work in this area, as did the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys.  I compliment her on her very hard and diligent work to make this happen.  That is welcome.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could take that point away.  There are so many potential solutions that could be brought forward to deal with that area but all of this work is fruitless unless that reception issue can be addressed and solved.  It would be a very poor investment from the State's point of view if people could not access these services.<\/p>  <p>  My other point relates to rural businesses, such as those outside towns in rural constituencies like my own in Cork East.  The M9 and the Cork to Dublin motorway are vital links for these businesses.  They have attracted a lot of logistics companies into the area that require heavy goods transfers and other services so it is optimal for them to be located beside a motorway.  Another problem we have is that we cannot get high-speed broadband in areas like Rathcormac.  I do not mean to be too parochial in the House but that issue needs to be identified.  We are very lucky that we have these sources of employment.  In some cases the employers are hiring in excess of 100 employees.  I come from Youghal.  There is no private employer or business in Youghal town with over 100 people working in it at the moment and that is an issue we need to address.  There are rural villages near the motorway with large businesses operating in them but they cannot get Internet and there is a two or three year wait.  I do not need to harp on about how important access to high-speed broadband is but this is a State-led emergency intervention.  In 2022, we need to look at ramping up that intervention and if private businesses of a sizeable scale want to sit down and consult NBI on the matter, that is something we as a Government should facilitate.<\/p>  <p>  We all know how important high-speed broadband has been throughout the pandemic.  I live in a secluded rural area and, unfortunately, we do not yet have a high-speed connection to our own home.  We are in the same boat as many others and are relying on satellite broadband connections.  The Government should also explore the expansion of that solution as part of NBI's work.  While satellites do not provide the most stable connection, they are a short-term solution that provide additional high-speed broadband.  That is one area that has to be incorporated into the plan.  Satellites could also address phone connectivity issues.  The ESB networks have a role to play in that regard and that is not being looked at as strongly as it could be.  We could lose our electric line network for the provision of limited facilities to improve rural 4G services.  There are swathes of the countryside where there is no coverage, no matter where you go in Ireland.  Even driving on the motorways between our major cities, there are serious blackspots where there is no phone reception.  That is a very important part of any business in today's world and its importance will continue to grow.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh said something that hit home for me.  She stated that there will be a significant wait, well into the mid 2020s, before a lot of rural areas receive any degree of connection.  What concerns me, and I am right to be concerned about this, is what new technologies will be available when we reach that stage and whether this represents value for the State.  It is important that we have an honest and frank conversation in a year's time with regard to that issue.  I will leave the rest of my time to my colleague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700044#UU00500","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1643298900,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thought I had an eight-minute slot.

I was struggling to make it here in time when the Government missed the last slot.  I mentioned some of this earlier, but another Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is present.  The goals of the national broadband plan are laudable and, we in People Before Profit believe, essential for rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of the services to more than 500,000 addresses is not only vital for businesses; it is vital for ordinary households and schools, etc.,  in an evermore online world where high-speed internet access is not some kind of a luxury but a bare minimum needed to participate fully in this society.  It becomes even more essential for access to State services and more essential still in a coronavirus-ridden world for remote learning and working.  There is no doubt about its importance.<\/p>  <p>  However laudable the goals, the current plan, for historical reasons, falls on every metric.  We have been repeatedly told this is essential infrastructure and must be provided by means of massive taxpayer subsidies of &euro;3 billion, but even the most risky gambler probably would not bet that the figure will not rise, as has happened in other outsourced national projects.  The primary justification is the lack of State telecommunications infrastructure, but that is the result of a Government decision.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, in 1999, committed to privatising Telecom &Eacute;ireann and the absolutely disastrous outcome of that decision is well known in this House.<\/p>  <p>  Our national communications infrastructure was repeatedly bought and sold, including by many of the big business names in Ireland.  At every stage, the company was loaded with debt and sweated for every cent that could be extracted, starving the company of needed infrastructural investment and leaving it incapable of anything like the services required, because it simply could not generate the necessary profits for whomever or whatever entity happened to own it at the time.  Fintan O'Toole famously said at the time that the assets and equity funds of that company were \"passed around [from Billy to Jack] like a joint at a student party\".  However, the decision to privatise Telecom &Eacute;ireann did not happen in a vacuum.  It has been part of a deep ideology of outsourcing essential services for State functions to the private sector and it always has dire outcomes for those of us who rely on those services and for every person and taxpayer in the country, as the costs always spiral.  Private entities involved must have their profits protected, regardless of the cost to the State, or the level of service provided.<\/p>  <p>  The list of failures is probably too long to go into here, but I will mention a few: public-private partnerships on toll roads; school buildings that are faulty and on which we pay more and more to have them sorted out; the national convention centre; the national children's hospital; and the cervical check programme.  Even with the history of a great number of observers of this plan having very serious concerns about it from the outset, it has developed in an even worse fashion than most of us had feared.  We now have a &euro;3 billion plan over 25 years, the infrastructure of which we will not own at the end.<\/p>  <p>  As if all of this was not bad enough, recent revelations on the financial structures and entities behind the NBI show us the company created a plan with a network of at least 13 different companies throughout Ireland, Luxembourg and America.  In fact, we now know that David McCourt's firm only owns approximately 10% of NBI, despite contrived corporate structures that seem to indicate he has a controlling stake.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone paying attention to the housing crisis, which all of us have been, knows the Oak Hill Advisors vulture fund has specialised in discounting bad loans to sweat borrowers and underline assets for cash.  In the previous D&aacute;il, Fianna F&aacute;il famously called for the nationalisation of the broadband plan, but it is silent on that issue now.  However, I echo that call, on behalf of People Before Profit, for any essential infrastructure in this State not to be outsourced like the list of those I have mentioned, and this outsourcing programme is a disaster.  Not only is it a disaster, but those who are given the responsibility to oversee the funding, ownership and control of the company is Ernst &amp;amp; Young.  It did a great job on the banks when it audited Anglo Irish Bank and if that is what we are relying on, then God help Ireland, because we are heading down a disastrous road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700045#VV00500","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1643298900,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I looked at NBI's website earlier this week and the statistics on it are underwhelming.  Almost 300,000 premises have been surveyed; 250,000 completed; more than 150,000 premises are under construction or constructed; and 55,000 premises are available for order.  Apparently, 450 BCPs have been installed.  However, we have learned from \"Prime Time\" in the past month or so that there are just 3,335 homes connected throughout the State.  Progress has been painfully slow.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a lady last week who had been searching for months for a rental property in the south Kildare area within her budget, which is a hard find.  She finally found a home in the Lackagh area, but was unable to move in because the Internet speed was measured at 1.9 Mbps.  The lady works from home for a large multinational company and needs a good connection to save a 90-mile round-trip commute to Dublin.  The expected connection date for the premises is - wait for it - December 2026.<\/p>  <p>  Rural dwellers cannot put their lives on hold for the next five years.  The Government needs to get the finger out and take urgent action.  Decent Internet speed is not just about streaming movies, although in many parts of County Kildare and Portarlington, County Laois, where trips to the cinema are difficult to make if one does not drive, entertainment is a relevant factor.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses struggle to complete payroll, students struggle to submit assignments and community groups struggle to connect with their members due to poor broadband speeds.  I had an email from a rural school last week that had recently taken delivery of a number of Chromebooks, due to its own fundraising, which is another story in itself.  However, it is unable to use them due to the poor Internet speed in the area.  Staff have also undertaken considerable upskilling to ensure the pupils' development of digital skills and literacy are enhanced and the school sourced Internet safety books for staff, parents and pupils from Barnardos.<\/p>  <p>  It has done everything possible to ensure its pupils are supported.  Unfortunately, it is let down time and again by its poor quality Internet connection.  I have written to the Minister for Education on this and I am still waiting on a reply.  The maximum speed available for the connection appears to be approximately 7 Mbps.  If one teacher streams video content to his or her classroom, this has a detrimental impact on the ability of other classes to use the Internet.  This is not acceptable in this day and age.<\/p>  <p>  Schools must be prioritised for connection to high-speed broadband.<\/p> <p>There is an increased use of Google Classroom and Apps such as Aladdin and Seesaw in our schools.  This is a welcome development but can cause untold heartbreak for rural families who struggle to go online.  In many parts of south Kildare, as the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, and Portarlington, we have a digital divide where rural dwellers are left behind and the Government is washing its hands of them.  Sinn F&eacute;in did not favour the current set-up with the national broadband roll-out.  At the time, we proposed using ESB Networks or another State agency with a track record in delivering large-scale infrastructure projects.  Instead the Government, not surprisingly, chose the privatisation route, which is not delivering on its targets, will not be in public ownership and is removed from accountability that would have existed if Sinn F&eacute;in was in government.  It is not good enough and it needs to change now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700045#VV00600","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643299500,"counter":512,"content":"<p>As the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, as a member of the Business Committee I supported the taking of the questions and answers session earlier in the debate on the structure and roll-out of the NBP.  I also called for it in the House before Christmas, as Members are genuinely concerned by what the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, called earlier, \"a complex corporate structure\".  We have heard of references to holding companies, entities and subcontractors.  It is mesmerising.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that the Minister of the day was kept at arm's length from the procurement process, which meant that the Minister had no knowledge of this structure.  The Department itself was responsible for the governance of the national broadband plan and departmental officials need to be brought before the relevant committees to answer questions on these particular issues.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister, it was always my intention to publish the contract and only exclude the bare minimum and I believe that has not yet been fulfilled.  While all of this is important, the primary focus of questions that I have been receiving as a public representative is when people will get access to the broadband network.<\/p>  <p>  While I was blamed for being too attentive to the project, the present Government ignored this project for the past two years.  It has, at least in part, contributed to the current slippage with the project now running 12 months behind target despite the commitments in the programme for Government to fast-track the project.  The Government made that promise to fast-track the project and then it sat on its hands.  The Government has tried to pass off these delays as due to Covid  In September, the Oireachtas was given a revised target of passing 60,000 premises by the end of the year and instead they passed only 35,000 by 1 January, a slippage of 25,000 premises in only 107 days.  In reality, this means that 100,000 fewer homes will have access to the high-speed broadband at the end of this year than was planned when the contract was signed in November 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I have put on the D&aacute;il and the committee record where, I believe, the Government has failed but, to the credit of the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, he has been prepared to listen to suggestions and to act upon them.  I want to acknowledge that and put forward some constructive suggestions.  I was on the ground in Blessington looking at the build-out and it was clear that there were substantial challenges with the condition of the existing network.  This was known for many months.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, before Christmas, sat down with the chief executives of both Eir and NBI to help address these delays but with the clear issues on the condition of the existing network, one has to ask the question as to why we had to wait 25 months into the contract for that meeting to take place.  I want to know, on foot of this particular meeting, what is now being done by Eir to resolve these particular issues.  I also want to know if the issue of the quality of the surveying came up in those discussions because I understand that some of the drawings that the NBI build contractors received had no bearing whatsoever to the existing infrastructure that was on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to be honest with people.  Everyone cannot be connected at the start of the build programme.  That is why, as Minister, I insisted on the roll-out of the broadband connection points providing high-speed BCPs in rural communities, which has now morphed into digital hubs providing hot-desking facilities across this country.  The vast majority of the population today now have access to one of these within 30 minutes of them and that is a positive development.  This project has now been expanded to include all primary schools and several marts, which is also very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government to ensure that everyone has access to a provisional date for connection to this network right across the 227 deployment areas.  Even if at this stage it is only a list of how NBI will progress through each of those 227 deployment areas, it at least gives an indication to people.  This would not only bring clarity to families and business, but also to alternative wireless providers who can focus their marketing and deployment on those homes that are later in the build programmes.<\/p>  <p>  As NBI delivers fibre broadband to homes, families will come off these wireless services.  Companies, such as Eurona Brisknet in County Roscommon, are pre-selling fibre connections.  When people are connected, they are moving that equipment to more isolated homes providing them with a broadband service allowing them to work from home and gain some of the benefit of the connections that have taken place.  The reality is there will be only a short window for a return on this supplementary deployment and we need the local authorities and State bodies to provide temporary sites free of charge to allow them to expand their reach.  This is a cost-effective way to extend the benefit of the early deployment areas to homes that will be waiting a number of years for a fibre connection.  There is no point spending another 25 months thinking about this.  There are proactive wireless companies, such as Eurona Brisknet, that are willing to embrace this model if the State meets them halfway.  It should not be forgotten that I released the 5G network specifically to support the roll-out by companies, such as Imagine, of their next generation wireless service.  These companies need to be supported in expanding their reach to more isolated rural homes, especially as capacity and existing equipment becomes available, and they need access to the NBI backhaul.  Let us at least have one constructive outcome from today's debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700046#WW00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1643299500,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Now we go to a Government slot where Deputy Alan Farrell is sharing with Deputy Murnane O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700046#WW00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1643299500,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thought I was taking the slot of Deputy Matthews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700046#WW00400","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1643299500,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Deputy Matthews had a short slot.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  I appreciate the opportunity to address this.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, probably will not mind me making this point that this is not the national rural broadband plan; it is the national broadband plan.  I say that because 13,000 homes in Dublin are to be included in the roll-out by NBI.  It is important to say that, as a representative of the largest of those constituencies in Dublin, the vast majority of those 13,000 are probably in my constituency.  On that basis, it is important to talk about what this is rather than what it is not and about the fact that we are here because of what I submit to be a disastrous policy decision made more than 20 years ago to privatise the entire telecommunications network, including the lines.  That policy, of course, has had disastrous consequences in the sense that it was left to private enterprise to invest and it did not invest in the more difficult areas, particularly in my constituency where people live in rural environments west of the M1 motorway but also in some of the suburban towns in the northern end of the constituency.  For instance, I got an email only this week from NBI outlining 2,400 homes that will be provided with high-speed broadband up to 500 Mbps in the next year or two.  This is real progress.  While, of course, I am a little upset by the fact that there has been significant delays to the development of the NBI plan because of Covid, I am also a realist.  I appreciate that people were in lockdown and, therefore, there was automatic slippage.<\/p> <p>This is not an opportunity to ask a question of the Minister of State but it is something for the officials to note.  Can we make up time, and if so, how much can we make up in the coming years?  There is significant work, not limited to communities such as those in Skerries, Balbriggan, Balrothery and Man O'War.  There has been significant progress in regard to connections to local sporting organisations such as Man O'War GFC, some of our cultural sites such as Newbridge House and Farm, and a number of other GAA clubs such as Fingal Ravens GFC.  That is an opportunity for us to ensure the digital hubs are there for people who might be waiting a little longer to get themselves connected to high-speed broadband.<\/p> <p> Of course, as has been mentioned by many Deputies, there are obvious societal benefits, in respect not just of education but also of working from home, which we are encouraging and now legislating for and which is a welcome development.  The more people who have high-speed broadband, the more services that can be provided, such as e-health, which is another reasonable way for people to cut their carbon emissions along with working from home, whereby they do not have to travel or take up space, whether on a commuter train, a bus or in their car, emitting unnecessary carbon emissions.  That they can work from home has a real benefit.  It also has an economic benefit because those who stay in the rural community will shop there.  Rather than buy a roll in the city, they stay local, which is good.<\/p> <p> I am encouraged by the gathering of pace of the national broadband plan, Covid delays notwithstanding.  Communities throughout the country will benefit from this.  I mentioned the fact we are here because of a disastrous policy decision, but we have undone that policy decision by bringing forward the national broadband plan and ensuring communities are connected both in rural Ireland and in my constituency, which I do not think any of my rural colleagues would accept is rural Ireland.

It was 2013, one year after the national broadband plan was originally published, in August 2012, and two years after the publication of the next generation broadband task force report in 2011, yet he we are, at the start of 2022, more than one decade after that report was published, and many parts of both rural and urban Ireland are still without access to basic infrastructure, namely, high-speed fibre connections.  That is incredible.<\/p>  <p>  Several Government Deputies have argued this project is gathering pace.  What do they mean exactly by \"gathering pace\"?  I quoted an announcement as far back as 2013, and here we are in 2022.  It is shameful and there is no excuse for such a delay.  It has certainly hampered businesses.  I have heard directly from many small employers, one of which, in Rosenallis, County Laois, has 30 employees.  He cannot get high-speed broadband in the area and was told it will take a number of years.  If that is how employers are treated, it is no wonder we do not have enough jobs or enough job creation in rural Ireland.  We are being let down by this so-called plan.  It is not a good plan and it is not credible.  It is not credible to leave people waiting years for such basic infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  We in the Rural Independent Group have sought a briefing with National Broadband Ireland to discuss the many issues and to ask the questions that need to be asked because we need proper constructive engagement and firm commitments we can stand over.  To expect Deputies to tell their constituents they must wait until 2025 or 2026 for basic infrastructure such as national broadband just does not cut it.  It is not acceptable in the least.  So much for gathering pace.  I do not call it \"gathering pace\" if we have to wait that long.  Surely something can be done here, given that in all our communities, areas and employers are affected.  Businesses throughout the country are affected.  It will hamper our chances of bringing in foreign direct investment or of encouraging local enterprises to set up in a particular area or community.  Not having this infrastructure in place is holding back our local economy and holding back potential.  There is something radically wrong, and we all need to ask questions about the national broadband plan.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of my constituency, Laois-Offaly, National Broadband Ireland has confirmed to me that, while areas in Offaly such as those in and around Clonygowan are within its intervention area, the anticipated connection date is between January 2025 and December 2026.<\/p> <p>As I said before, that is totally unacceptable, particularly when the Government is talking about legislation allowing people to work from home and we are hearing this sort of spin.  How can people work from home if they do not have basic broadband?  It is certainly going to put paid to that notion for many families, who will just not be able to do it and will have no option but to commute.  Even if their employer is willing to let them work from home, it cannot happen unless the infrastructure is there.<\/p> <p> There is too much delay and there is acceptance around that from the Government, which is very concerning.  I would have thought the Government would be more critically evaluating the whole process and asking the questions, as elected representatives.  I believe that is the proper way to pursue the issue.<\/p> <p> It is a long time since the report of the task force I mentioned, some 15 years.  I have serious concerns with regard to the cost of the project.  This is comparable to the National Children's Hospital, given it is &euro;2.1 billion.  That is very concerning and we need to ask questions, as public representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700047#XX00300","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643300700,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I apologise.

I am not sure how I can do justice to this topic in five minutes.   I welcome it.  However, in a sense, we are putting the cart before the horse.  At the moment, there is a committee meeting going on, or it has just finished, where the CEO and the committee are teasing out very important issues, and the Committee of Public Accounts is due to have an appearance by the CEO on 10 February.  I would have thought that, rather than speaking in a vacuum today, some of the issues we highlighted would be crystallised and we would have a better chance at that stage.<\/p>  <p>  On this page I have in front of me, I have a list of various places ar fud Conamara, inar cuireadh in i&uacute;l dom nach bhfuil an c&oacute;ras ag feidhmi&uacute; agus go bhfuil muintir na h&aacute;ite th&iacute;os &oacute; thaobh easpa leathanbhanda.  While I will not read out personal things, I want to refer to the information on the page.  At Pairc L&aacute;ir, An Spide&aacute;l, four people are trying to work from home in an amber area, the time spent will be two to four years and Sky does not provide a service.  At Loch&aacute;n Beag, it is in an amber area situated on a link road between two complete access fibre ribbons, but they cannot get it.  At Knock South, Inverin, five people are working from there, just off the R336, where fibre runs.  I could go on.<\/p>  <p>  We spend our time taking these representations.  I appreciate the Minister of State who was present earlier, Deputy Ossian Smyth, has taken a hands-on approach, as I am sure has the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon.  This begs questions as to why a busy Minister has to take such a hands-on approach when there are all of the officials to run what should be an open and accountable contract without all of this extra effort.  I would love to know the price of that.  We spend our time putting in representations and fighting to move people along the colour board from blue to amber, and then fighting within that amber to see what year it will be.  I will leave that point and use my time to deal with other issues.<\/p>  <p>  I never thought I would stand here and agree with Deputy Alan Farrell.  I absolutely agree with him when he belatedly said that, unfortunately, it was an absolute disaster when Telecom &Eacute;ireann was privatised by flotation back in 1999, given what happened after that.  It was a major mistake.  We are now investing somewhere between &euro;2.1 billion and &euro;3 billion and, even in itself, that uncertainty is unhelpful.  While it was clarified as &euro;2.1 billion in a contract, it is a lot more than that.  There is a huge effort from the Department to monitor a contract that we have not seen because, despite the fact the former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, said it would be published almost in full, we have not seen it.  We are here getting reassurances and talking around in circles, trying to find out how this contract is being implemented and find out about the person fronting it, who appears to have only a 10% share, and all of the other myriad companies behind it.  However, let us not bother our little minds about that because it is all too complex for us.  It is ironic we are talking about communications and broadband, and facilitating easier communication, while all of the time we are obfuscating, confusing and hiding communication, and making it impossible for ourselves, because we are just ordinary Deputies, to read stuff and ask appropriate questions.  It is not possible and the Minister of State knows that.  Over and over again, we see various examples of different organisations where the governance has utterly failed - everything from the children's hospital, which had an outside board attached to it to monitor what was going on, to yesterday's terrible report on CAMHS in County Kerry.  All of the time, it is governance failing.  What do we do?  We sign a contract that is too complex for the ordinary Deputy to understand.<\/p>  <p>  Belatedly, we then put in a public service director, or whatever the correct title is.  She was put in almost a year later.  What is the role of that woman?  Has she come back and reported to the Government in regard to various issues?  What issues have arisen?  I understand the problem with a public director is that his or her duty is to the company, so what is the point of having a public director?  I happened to be at one or two meetings initially, when my colleague Deputy Pringle was not available.  I asked this very question in regard to the role of a public director and what was going to happen but we have heard nothing since in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We are here today, looking at something like this, without any connection to the other companies on the ground.  We have all met them.  We have been overwhelmed with representations from companies on the ground, so we can do it but we are not being facilitated.  We have an awful lot of complaints about Eir and we have to continuously pressurise it so that people come off the amber because Eir has finally facilitated them.<\/p>  <p>  My time is up and I have not even approached the issue.  While I am not complaining, this is no way to bring openness and accountability to a contract like this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700048#YY01100","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1643300700,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions throughout what has been a very important process, not just the statements in the last hour or so but the questions and answers with the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, prior to that.  I thank the House on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, for the invitation to address the House on the roll-out of the national broadband plan and for the views expressed by the various Members throughout this discussion on the matter, which is one of absolute national importance.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's earlier contribution made a reference that I have made myself on a number of occasions, and many in this House have also acknowledged that the scale of what we are doing here has never been reached in terms of infrastructure roll-out since the electrification of Ireland.  There are a lot of good analogies in that space.  Obviously, it is a mammoth undertaking and, in that regard, it was always going to face challenges, some of them unforeseen, such as Covid, which I will touch on shortly regarding the steps that are being taken to respond to that.  In terms of the net benefit for companies, individuals, farms, schools and all the other premises that have been connected, during the electrification of Ireland at that time, people thought that was simply to bring light into a house and no one could ever have envisaged all the different uses and different appliances we would end up plugging in and using electricity for now.<\/p> <p>Similarly, we cannot even envisage the myriad uses there will be for a high-speed network and the smart lives we will be able to live in our homes in the future.  That is why this is the right thing to do.  Questions have been raised about the cost of this.  Fine Gael was criticised in the previous Government for driving on with this.  We have been vindicated by the fact the overall NBP is critical.  It is the right thing to do.  It is a very ambitious approach by this Government and the previous Government to be world leaders in the reach we will have throughout our country.<\/p> <p> As the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, said earlier, I confirm to the House the NBP remains a top priority of the Government for those reasons.  At the centre of this plan is the delivery of high-speed broadband for the citizens of Ireland, both from a value for money and a delivery of critical infrastructure perspective.  It is a vital utility necessary for the continued economic and social development of our country.  Balanced regional development is so important to us.  That is why no home has been left behind and everybody in all parts will be covered, both urban and rural, and those in between on the edges of places who do not have that access.  We will not have any digital divide in this country because of the NBP.  That is an important result that will be achieved by the end of this.<\/p> <p> It is clear from the contributions Deputies have made today that this House shares the Government's strong desire to ensure high-speed broadband and a future-proofed network are delivered throughout Ireland as soon as possible.  While substantial progress has been made to date, complications such as Covid have impacted on the delivery of the fibre network, resulting in delays to the delivery of aspects of the programme.<\/p> <p> The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the contract.  The focus for 2022 is to continue to develop momentum in the build, to catch up on the delays experienced, and to plan for acceleration, which everybody in this House wants.  We know that from our individual roles in each of our constituencies.  I am all too aware that we in Kildare we are inundated, as much as everyone in this House is, with calls about frustrations.  The point was raised earlier that a person can be just down the road from somebody, that the infrastructure is so close, and they ask if they cannot get it connected quicker.  We all want this to happen as quickly as possible.  The Government is working in a co-ordinated fashion.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is leading the charge in its engagement with NBI to do that, to develop momentum in the build, to catch up on delays that were experienced last year, and to plan for acceleration.  Final targets for 2022 will be agreed shortly.  Transparency and openness have been raised.  Those targets will be clear to everybody.  That will give us a real sense of the momentum we are looking to build.<\/p> <p> Both the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, are equally keen to see broadband delivered to all citizens as soon as possible, as are all of us in government and in this House.  The progression of the roll-out by NBI, in tandem with increased commercial investment by operators such as Eir, SIRO and Virgin Media, is the best means of achieving this.  We will continue to work together to deliver for the people of Ireland a broadband plan that will future-proof our country, both economically and societally.  It is critical to balanced regional development and to all aspects of our lives.  It continues to be a top priority of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700048#YY01200","speaker":"1586","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1643301300,"counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700049#ZZ00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1643301300,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Colm Burke - to discuss the need for a peer review system for psychiatrists in the Irish mental health services; (2) Deputy Brendan Griffin - the review of south Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS; (3) Deputy Gary Gannon - to discuss the lack of affordable medicine for pregnant people suffering with hyperemesis in Ireland; (4) Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor - to discuss an update on public transport facilities in County Carlow; (5) Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh - to discuss the failure of Department of Housing to share plans with the Moore Street Advisory Group to pay &euro;1.5 million to the street traders; (6) Deputies Bernard J.

I believe this is important legislation for reforming and modernising how we govern the higher education sector.  It needs to be seen alongside a broader programme of reform of the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, student grant scheme, reducing the cost of education, making sure there is education for all, and creating a unified, integrated third level system across apprenticeships, further education and training, and higher education.  As we invest more and more in higher education, it is important we have modern governance structures in place and oversight and accountability mechanisms that recognise the autonomy of institutions but also the public policy concerns and views this House and the people will have in ensuring we have a modern, fit for purpose, agile, flexible, higher education system that can deliver educationally and deliver the skills our country requires now and in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I began last night to outline the sections of the Bill.  I got as far as section 34.  Sections 35 and 36 provide for the preparation by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in consultation with the Minister, of a performance framework for the higher education and research system and the agreement by the HEA of performance agreements with designated institutions of higher education that are in accordance with the performance framework.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 37 to 42, inclusive, provide that grants may be issued by the HEA to higher education institutions or other bodies or persons which provide services consistent with the functions of the HEA.  The HEA shall prepare and establish a framework, with the approval of the Minister, for the allocation of funding.  Funding to bodies shall be made in accordance with such conditions of funding as specified by the chief executive officer of the HEA.  The chief executive officer of the HEA may request and use the information provided by other bodies to establish if an education provider meets the criteria, terms and conditions of the funding framework and ensure a funded body is compliant on an ongoing basis with the conditions of funding.  The chief executive officer may review compliance with conditions of funding by a funded body and may, following this review and consultation with the funded body, issue appropriate directions in writing regarding continued compliance with the conditions of funding.  The chief executive officer may impose remedial or other measures on the funded body for non-compliance with conditions of funding.  The body may appeal against the decision of the chief executive officer to impose remedial or other measures.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 43 to 45, inclusive, provide for formal engagement between students and designated institutions of higher education, including the provision of training for students participating as members of the governing body of a designated institution of higher education.  There is also provision for the HEA to engage with and seek views from representatives of students, including representatives of students in priority groups, on issues of relevance at a national level to the experience of students participating in higher education.  These sections also provide for the HEA to undertake, in partnership with other bodies, a student survey at least every two years in respect of undergraduate students and postgraduate students.<\/p>  <p>  Section 46 provides that the HEA shall prepare and submit to the Minister for approval a draft strategic action plan providing for equity of access, participation and promotion of success for a period of up to seven years.  Each designated institution of higher education is required to report annually to the HEA on the implementation of the plan.<\/p> <p>Section 47 provides that the HEA will promote and support designated institutions of higher education in the development and provision of lifelong and flexible learning.  Sections 48 to 52 provide for the collection and sharing of personal and non-personal data from designated institutions of higher education and funded bodies subject to the data protection regulation, the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019.  There is also provision for the HEA to carry out studies and research on any issue related to its functions.<\/p> <p> Sections 53 to 60 provide for the designation of higher education providers as designated institutions of higher education.  Universities, institutes of technology, technological universities, the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, and education providers which have received a university authorisation order under the Universities Act 1997 are automatically classified as designated institutions of higher education for the purposes of this Bill.  Other higher education providers may be designated by ministerial order as designated institutions of higher education under the Act if, following an application for designation, they meet certain conditions following an assessment process undertaken by the HEA.  The conditions of designation will be made by regulation by the Minister in consultation with the HEA and the designated institutions of higher education will be required to comply on an ongoing basis with these conditions.  The HEA may undertake reviews of compliance and the Minister may make an order revoking the designation if a designated institution of higher education is not complying with the conditions for designation or where a designated institution of higher education has made an application for the revoking of the designation order itself.  A designated institution of higher education may use the title \"Designated Institution of Higher Education\" to describe itself and it precludes a body which is not a designated institution of higher education from using that title.<\/p> <p> Sections 61 to 63 provide that a designated institution which is not already obligated by sectoral legislation to do so, shall prepare a strategic development plan and an equality statement and provide them to the HEA and shall keep all proper and usual accounts.  Sections 64 to 69 provide that the chief executive officer, CEO, may request the governing body of a designated institution of higher education to undertake a review where there are concerns about the governance or performance of a designated institution of its functions or responsibilities and to provide a report of the matter to the CEO.  The CEO may make a determination for action following consideration of a report under section 64 if he or she is not satisfied that concerns regarding the performance by the designated institution of higher education have been adequately addressed and resolved, or if the designated institution of higher education concerned does not undertake a review or prepare and submit a report to the CEO.  The determination may include all or any of the following actions: the provision of assistance to the institution concerned; the imposition of remedial measures as respects the institution concerned; the provision of information to such other bodies as the CEO considers appropriate; or the undertaking of a review of the institution concerned with the approval of the board.<\/p> <p> Sections 70 to 72 provides for an appeals process.  Appeals can be made under sections: 42(6) in relation to the imposition of remedial measures following review of compliance with conditions of funding; 54(12) regarding a refusal to make a designation order in respect of a higher education provider; 59(13) in relation to the revocation of a designation order in respect of a higher education provider; or 65(4) regarding the imposition of remedial measures following the review and report by a designated institution of higher education.<\/p> <p> Sections 73 to 118 relate to amendments to the sectoral legislation including the Universities Act 1997, the Technological Universities Act 2018, the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992, the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act 1994 and the National College of Art and Design Act 1971.  These amendments include the reform of the governing authorities or bodies of universities, technological universities and institutes of technology to provide that they shall consist of 17 members appointed by the governing authority or body, comprising one external chairperson, two students, one chief officer, five internal members other than the chief officer, three external members nominated by the Minister, and five external members, other than the chairperson.  These sections also contain a provision that the governing authority of Trinity College Dublin shall comprise of 17 members and up to an additional five fellows and the amendment of the Trinity College Supplemental Letters Patent of 1911, as amended by the Trinity College Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Act 2000, to be in accordance with the provisions of the Universities Act 1997.  Other amendments provide that the chairperson of the governing authority of a university shall be appointed by a majority vote of not less than two-thirds and that the chairperson is an external member of the governing authority.  That is an important change.  These sections also provide for additional functions for the governing authorities or bodies to ensure good governance practice and the insertion of new sections to provide that the governing authority or body can carry out a review of a matter if it has concerns regarding the governance or performance of the functions or responsibilities of the higher education institutions.  Another important provision is that the governing authority or body shall, with the approval of the Minister, determine the transitional arrangements and procedures to be put in place to ensure that the new governing authorities or bodies comply with the new provisions for governing authorities or bodies within 12 months.  The Bill provides for consultation by the governing authority or body on the preparation of the strategic development plan.  It also includes provisions for consultation by the governing authority or body on the preparation of the equality policy and provisions for members of the governing authority or body other than an ex officio member who is an employee of the higher education institutions to receive remuneration subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Other amendments to the National College of Art and Design Act 1971 to modernise the legislation include the provision of an academic council and academic freedom of the governing authority and the academic staff of the college.<\/p> <p> Sections 119 to 124 provide for minor amendments to the Student Support Act 2011, the Industrial Training Act 1967, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.  Sections 125 to 128 provide for the publication by the HEA of the names of the designated institutions of higher education, the preparation or adoption and issuing of guidelines, codes or policies to designated institutions of higher education by the HEA, the methods of sending a notice and consequential amendments of enactments in Schedule 4.<\/p> <p> Schedule 1 provides the enactments to be repealed by this Act including the entirety of the Higher Education Authority Act 1971.  Schedule 2 provides detailed regulations regarding the operation of the board of the HEA.  Schedule 3 provides the detail regarding the making of a scheme amending the existing superannuation schemes of the HEA made under Section 15 of the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 while schedule 4 provides a detailed list of amendments to other enactments, primarily definitions to ensure compatibility with this legislation.<\/p> <p> To summarise, this is genuinely the most significant legislative reform of the third level education system since the 1971 Act establishing the HEA.  The world has changed an awful lot since 1971, as has higher education.  As far as I remember, when these Houses passed the Higher Education Authority Bill in 1971 there were around 20,000 students in full-time higher education in Ireland.  Thanks to huge societal progress in our country, economic progress and policies pursued by this Oireachtas through successive Governments, we now have a student population that is well above 200,000 and approaching 250,000.  The world has changed, the education system has changed and the level of funding and investment from the taxpayer has changed.  Education in and of itself has changed and it is important that the legislative framework changes as well.  The aim of this Bill is to set up a modern system for future students, staff and governing authorities of higher education institutions and with this we will drive forward higher performance, accountability and overall improvements in our higher education system.  This education tries to ensure that we absolutely respect the autonomy of our higher education institutions but that we also help them to make sure that their own internal governance is fit for purpose.  It is not acceptable in the twenty first century, and I am not sure it was acceptable in the twentieth century, to have boards that are not chaired by external members.  We cannot have a scenario where the chief executive is also the chair of the board.  We have to get real here and modernise.  We must recognise that we need boards based on competencies and skill sets.  I pay huge tribute to all who have served and who currently serve on governing authorities.  They do so without remuneration and they do so driven by the public good.  I thank them all for their service.  This legislation is about recognising that we need smaller boards, with more external appointees and an external chairperson and that the HEA, the Minister and the Department must be clear in relation to the setting of overall higher education policy in our country.  <\/p> <p> There is no doubt that higher education system is a key plank of our country's future, our people's prosperity.  It is also a driver of equality and cultural change and integral to our national economic and social sustainability.  It is essential that we bring a clear, specific and respectful definition to the relationship between higher education institutions and the State.  This legislation is a crucial part of the Government's reform agenda for the higher education system but it is just one part.  Others include a sustainable funding model, changes around student accommodation, reform of the SUSI grant, the delivery of the technological universities and the expansion of the apprenticeship programme.  This is a jigsaw and these are all important parts of forming that picture.  As we look to drive our ambitions forward, we are seeking to ensure that the fundamental building blocks of governance and funding are firmly in place.  I genuinely look forward to working with Members on all sides of this House on this legislation as it goes through the various stages.  I hope we can work together to tease through issues and to make sure we produce the best possible law.  I look forward to engaging in that spirit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643301900,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  As he knows, Sinn F&eacute;in supports legislative reform in higher education to clarify the role of the HEA, to increase inclusion and access and to ensure proper governance and accountability.  I acknowledge that the Minister and his Department have taken on board a number of recommendations - some, but not all - that Sinn F&eacute;in put forward during pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>They included issues around the role of the HEA in promoting the Irish language, increasing North-South co-operation, increasing the number of board members and the removal of the limit on the number of members on the academic councils.  I welcome the inclusion of student representation on the board of the HEA.  I call on the Minister to take on board the committee recommendation that trade union representation should be included on the board of the HEA.  <\/p> <p> Similarly, I welcome the inclusion of the specific role of the HEA in promoting cross-border co-operation in higher education.  The education committee also specifically called for a role for the HEA in promoting cross-border student enrolment.  I welcome that the Bill now makes specific reference to the role of the HEA in promoting the Irish language.  I assume that was an oversight in the general scheme and I am glad it is now included.  That said, the role given to the HEA in promoting the Irish language is weaker in this Bill than in the 1971 Act that it will replace and in the Universities Act 1997.  I believe it should be strengthened.<\/p> <p> Despite these changes in the general scheme, there is still substantial room for improvement in the Bill.  We will continue to work constructively with the Minister to try to get the Bill where it needs to be.  As things stand, I am not satisfied that the Minister has struck the right balance between the autonomy for the institutions of higher education and the governing oversight.  I have engaged extensively with the sector over recent months and the management of every institution accepts the need for the highest standards and for transparency and accountability of public finances.  That is without exception and it is beyond question.  The Minister will always have my support and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support for any policy that achieves that.  However, there are many proposals in the Bill which reduce the autonomy of institutions of higher education without any clear relationship with transparency and accountability.  I have yet to see or hear a convincing justification for dictating such rigid governance structures such as the mandatory 17-member limit on the governing bodies.  These are all unpaid positions.  Every governing body has its own unique make-up and tradition.  Slashing the numbers allowed on the board seems mistaken.  It is a decision that colleges are more than capable of making, as long as they meet certain standards of competency and external representation.  The substantial reduction in size will put more strain on members and will reduce representation on the board of different institutions and the wider communities.  The removal of the broader representation on the governing bodies will be a real loss.  It is unfair to say that the legislation will move the sector to a competency-based governance model.  Governing bodies are currently made up of members of academic and non-academic staff, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, alumni, local authority nominees, trade union representatives, employers organisations and others.  As recently as 2018, a Fine Gael Government passed legislation on technological universities that stipulated a 22-person governing body or 26 in certain cases.  A few short years later, that has been reduced even further without any clear explanation of its merits.  We need to have further discussions on that<\/p> <p> It is claimed that this Bill will promote a student-focused system.  However it seems that because of the reforms to governing bodies, students will have less representation on governing bodies in all higher education institutions.  The Minister needs to clarify the potential impact this could have on the representation of undergraduate and postgraduate students on the governing bodies, on the representation of academic and non-academic staff and on trade union representation.<\/p> <p> Governing boards benefit and are strengthened by external membership.  However, this legislation mandates a majority of external members without clear justification or explanation.  How strong could the justification possibly be given that board exemptions have been granted for Trinity College Dublin?  I have no issue with TCD being shown flexibility to reflect its unique governance structure but I believe that different models can be equally successfully provided for.  Certain safeguards are in place to ensure good governance, transparency and accountability.  TCD is not the only college with its own unique history and governance structure.  I think of the newly formed Atlantic technological university that will soon make Castlebar a university town and I look forward to that.  This multi-campus technological university involves thousands of students spread across locations in Castlebar, Galway city, Killybegs, Letterfrack, Letterkenny, Mountbellew and Sligo.  The geographical spread and multi-campus nature of this university will mean it is very distinct from most other colleges, yet it is being given no flexibility to anyone, whether student, parent, academic, staff or otherwise.  This looks unfair and elitist.  The Minister should look again at the rigid and overly prescriptive governance structures and find a fair approach that can be applied to everyone without damaging the unique characteristics, and the differentiated missions of the different institutions.<\/p> <p> A stated purpose of the Bill is to clarify the role of the HEA.  The Bill seems to strengthen the HEA in some ways, yet in others it seems to be reduced to a regulator rather than a strong independent authority capable of advocating for the needs of the sector.  The HEA should have a role in ensuring that the sector is adequately resourced.  Under the Bill as it stands, I believe it is not possible to do that.  As it currently stands, the  HEA no longer has any role as a voice for the sector.  A clear example of this is the fact that the CEO of the HEA will be specifically prohibited from commenting on policy.  The Bill states that the director \"shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy\".  I know this is not the first Bill to put this limit on this CEO of a State agency but that does not mean we should just accept it as the right way to go.  I would like the Minister to explain why this is necessary.  This fundamentally means that the HEA will be incapable of advocating for the sector and challenging the Government.<\/p> <p> The Bill grants sole powers of review to the HEA CEO and empowers the CEO to make a determination whether further action is necessary following a review.  The right of the HEA to appeal decisions must be robust enough to provide higher education institutions with assurances that they can challenge decisions.  In the heads of the Bill published last summer, all determinations of actions could be appealed whereas the Bill now allows only for a right of appeal against remedial measures.  On top of this, an appeal does not put a stay on the implementation of the measure determined by the CEO.  An appeals framework of this nature was not contemplated by the heads of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will be prepared to work with the Opposition and the sector to amend this section.<\/p> <p> I have met with most third level colleges in the State over the last 12 months and all of them were more than happy to be held to the highest standards of accountability as recipients of public funding.  That said, there was also a great deal of concern about the watering down of institutional autonomy.  Good governance and accountability can be ensured without sacrificing the autonomy of our third level institutions.  The greatest testament to the governance of higher education is that these institutions have managed to maintain the performance of the system over the last ten years.  We have seen over a decade of austerity in the higher education sector.  Fundamentally governance is not the main issue facing the sector.  Legislative reform will be of limited value unless it is accompanied by a sustainable funding model.  The Minister acknowledges that.  He did so when he acknowledged that even though the numbers have increased, that has not been underpinned by funding in the way it needs to be.  During that time, there has been a piecemeal privatisation and deep commercialisation of public third level education.  Today, most universities have a majority of revenue coming from sources other than the State.  Some of that is positive, such as winning competitive research funding or attracting more international students.  However, it has been driven out of necessity due to what the Irish Universities Association has labelled as state divestment from third level education.  That should concern us all.  The ethos and the focus of these centres of education and research have been shifted towards commercial considerations and huge amounts of time and energy are spent operating on a commercial basis.  This is energy that would be better spent on education and research.  I do not blame the individual institutions.  This has been explicit policy of successive Governments.<\/p> <p> I will work with the Minister on this legislation.  We want to make it as good as we possibly can.  We are rectifying legislation that is 50 years old.   We have a duty and responsibility to do that and I look forward to working with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700050#AAA00200","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643303100,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It is very welcome to have a Bill that overhauls the higher education system.  I support many of the provisions in the Bill.  I wish to raise a number of issues in relation to the south east.  I am sure the Minister expects that from colleagues across the State where new institutes of technology are being put in place.<\/p>  <p>  I begin with a number of points on the autonomy piece, which is really important.  I sat on the Committee of Public Accounts for several years and I fully agree we need to have real transparency and accountability regarding the higher education system and higher education institutions.  In my time on that committee I saw that there are many areas where that is not in place.  One of those areas is intellectual property rights when spin-out companies emerge from institutes of technology and universities, and conflicts of interest may have to be managed.  It is a really important area because I support innovation and spin-out companies, but it is about getting the process right and we need to see reform there.  I have a concern about autonomy and the limitation of the board of either a university or an institute of technology.  I refer to the fact that even if a higher education institution wants to increase the membership of the board, it will not be able to do so.  That seems problematic to me but maybe the Minister will be able to set out the rationale.<\/p>  <p>  I have a number of questions.  I would love to be able to give the Minister time to respond from my own time but I do not think it is possible.  I will pose the questions anyway and he might be able to come back to me.  First of all, there is obviously much excitement about the possibility that on 1 May this year, the south east will have a university for the first time, if that designation date happens.  I have a question on the process and whether any additional clarity is being sought by the institutions in Carlow or Waterford on that process and criteria.  Is it the case that the process is still on track?  Are we still looking at 1 May for designation?  I see the Minister is in agreement.  If that is the case, it is really good news.<\/p>  <p>  The second question relates to clarity on the funding commitments for Waterford specifically.  The Minister might remember there was a meeting of Oireachtas Members from across the south east.  One of the commitments that was given was there would be very substantial funding committed to the south east.  This applied especially to Waterford in order that the footprint of the campus be expanded.  We have not seen that yet.  There has not been any announcement.  There has been discussion and dialogue with developers, landowners and so on but that has been going on for a long time now and we need to bring clarity to it.  As we approach 1 May, the goodwill demonstrated by the Minister needs to be translated into real action.  There is also the appointment of a new chairperson.  When is that likely to happen?  Unfortunately, the Minister cannot come back in as the rules do not allow it.  If they did I would certainly give him the minute and a half I have left to respond.  He might come back to me in writing, if he can, on those matters.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, it might be no harm and a good opportunity for the Minister if he were to brief Oireachtas Members from the south east again over the next of weeks on where we are with this process, to assure us we are on track for 1 May and to update us on the financial commitments that were given.  This will ensure we can hit the ground running and have a first-class university for the south east.  It is timely that this Bill is happening now and we are going to see a new legal framework put in place for higher education institutions at a time when the south east is going to see, we hope, a university on 1 May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700052#CCC00100","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1643303100,"counter":542,"content":"<p>We are on track for 1 May and I commit to that meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700052#CCC00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1643303100,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700052#CCC00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1643303100,"counter":544,"content":"<p>This important Bill reflects the importance of higher education across the State, including in my own constituency through Maynooth University, which is in my home town.  Higher education matters to all of us.  It is encouraging to see the Minister has taken on board some of the suggestions from pre-legislative scrutiny, including ramping up North-South co-operation and a role for the HEA in promoting an Ghaeilge.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in feel the Bill could be a bit stronger on that, as Deputy Conway-Walsh has outlined.  It is welcome and positive, however.  On the North-South issue, we still want to see specific roles for the HEA in student enrolment.  It is absolutely vital.  We are also glad to see the Minister will no longer appoint the majority of board members to higher education institutions.  That is very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  However, despite all the talk and all the Bills, we will never get to where we really need to be without adequate funding.  I tell the Minister funding is where it is at.  I am asking him to put the Government's money where its mouth is by publishing the Cassells report's economic findings and removing higher education from the brutality of austerity.  We have now had at least two generations of students go through the system with it in the grip of austerity.  We really need to do much better for them and by them.  It goes without saying that Sinn F&eacute;in is hugely ambitious in higher education, for all our people and what they can achieve within it.  That is very much on display in the North.  I know there was a lot of chagrin from some of the sectarian Northern commentariat but we see the importance of higher education.  We want and need to see many more places available to prospective students so we can have more thinkers, more professionals and more well-paid jobs for all our workers across society.  As a new Deputy, I often find that we are delighted when a new post is created but then we cannot find a qualified person to fill it.  Therefore, we really must make more spaces available.  We are very glad to see that the Bill provides for structured student engagement and for lifelong and flexible learning.  Free secondary education revolutionised life and opportunity in this State for our people and now we need an equal freedom and opportunity when it comes to higher education here.<\/p>  <p>  On freedom and opportunity, I hope the Minister does not mind if I take advantage of this opportunity to ask about the situation at Maynooth University where students have been notified that courses with over 250 students are still to be taught online even though college catering and hospitality are open, as they indeed are across the town.  All the pubs are open in Maynooth.  There are students who have only had a whiff of a lecture hall since they started college and they really need to know why their lectures are online while society has reopened.  I will put down a question to the Minister on that.  It is not just me who is anxious as many of the Maynooth students who have been contacting me are very anxious for a reply as well.<\/p>  <p>  For us in Sinn F&eacute;in, another critical part of higher education is apprenticeships.  While I note there will be an apprenticeship office, it really must deliver.  We will be keeping a close eye on that so it does not become a vehicle to dismantle the craft apprentice model because it is very important.  I know from my constituents in Kildare North that there are many bright, talented young people in secondary school and some of them are bored stiff with it.  Sometimes they are made to feel kind of useless because they think in a different way and have a different kind of talent.  School is not for everybody and nor is third level, in the form of the traditional college.  For some of these kids, every day is torture.  They are dying to get out and start an apprenticeship that reflects their talent and career ambition.  They have so much to offer their community and our economy and when it comes to higher education it is important they are not left behind.<\/p>  <p>  Before I finish, I am also anxious that there be more trade union representation on the HEA board.  Equally, I would like to see the Bill give the HEA an explicit mandate to protect the public nature of public education, especially as it provides such a clear pathway for private colleges to become designated as higher education institutions and potentially be funded in the same way as public colleges.  Like housing, education is a civil right.  It is not a privilege, a commodity for profit or just something to be consumed.  It is therefore critical that the public nature of third level education be considered sacrosanct.  I ask that those points be taken on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700052#CCC00400","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1643303100,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak for the Labour Party on this important Bill.  I am grateful to my colleague Senator Hoey, who is our spokesperson on higher education, for giving me the benefit of her insights.  Obviously, I too have a strong interest in this area, having served a number of terms as a Senator for Dublin University.<\/p> <p>I am also very proud of my long association with the law school in Trinity College where for many years I taught and carried out research and administration, which is an important part of any academic job.  I am passionate about higher education and teaching.  I miss my students and the role of an academic.  It is a job that many people go to with a real vocation for teaching and engaging with students.<\/p> <p> It was very appropriate that the Minister started his speech on the Bill by acknowledging the enormous adaptability and significant work that has been put in by staff, students and administrators in third level institutions over the past 22 months in adapting to Covid-19.  We all acknowledge that it has not been easy.  It has been a major burden, especially on students.  All of us have heard from parents and students who have been distressed at the lack of face-to-face interaction, the lack of ability to be present on campuses, the lack of capacity to mix with peers and lecturers, and the major disadvantage they have been placed at as a result.  There has been a detrimental impact on their studies, but also on their personal and social development.  Any of us who are parents, or who know young people who are students, will be well aware of the huge difficulties and problems that has caused for many students and their families.  We also acknowledge and commend the staff who have done their very best in very difficult circumstances to provide high-quality teaching, albeit not face to face but remotely.  It has been very difficult for everyone so it was appropriate that the Minister acknowledged that.  I also want to join him in commending all those engaged in college communities at every level of further and higher education, including universities, colleges and institutes of further education, where we have seen such enormous effort put in to adapt to Covid-19.  It is so good to see campuses coming alive again and to see staff, students, administrators and all the communities on college campuses being able to engage face to face and be present again.<\/p> <p> I will also refer briefly to the gendered impacts of Covid-19 at third level.  This is something many of us will be very conscious of.  I should say that I have had engagement through the Athena Swan programme.  It is a great programme that we have seen being rolled out across the university sector in this country, as it has been elsewhere, which seeks to ensure that women have equal opportunities to men on campuses for promotion, in particular.  We know that Athena Swan has now gone beyond gender.  It is also looking at equality, diversity and inclusion programmes more broadly.  We knew even before Covid-19 that there were real problems with discrimination against women at third level.  Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, who brought a case against the National University of Ireland, Galway, highlighted inbuilt difficulties for women seeking promotion.  I again pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, former Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who brought forward women-only professorships, somewhat controversially, although I defended her very strongly.  The evidence of the need for such professorships was so clear as was the provision of positive action measures at third level to address the inbuilt obstacles facing women in career progression.<\/p> <p> That brings me back to the point about Covid-19.  While gains have been made through those professorships and the Athena Swan programme, with Covid we have unfortunately seen a particularly detrimental impact on women academics whose research output - numerous studies have shown this - has suffered more than that of male colleagues.  Across all professions and careers, women have borne the disproportionate burden of home schooling to the detriment of career progression.  In any debate on third level and the updating of its governance models, let us focus on the need to ensure we have not rowed back on progress made in addressing gender inequality.  Figures on women in professorship positions at higher levels are still very skewed against them.  We have seen, very happily, a woman provost elected in Trinity College Dublin and women are now heading up other higher education institutions.  It is great to see that progress being made, but we are all very conscious that there is still a lot to be done to ensure we do not have gender inequality in third level.<\/p> <p> There are clearly other issues around diversity, especially in respect of economic disadvantage and class bias, which is something I have worked on in Trinity's law school scholarship programme.  We have got a very strong model with the Trinity access programme, as have other universities and colleges, in trying to address the problem of inbuilt lower levels of progression to third level from students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  That is something that has to be addressed.  I do not think any debate on third level governance should take place without reference to that.  There are some specific provisions in the Bill where more could be done on diversity.<\/p> <p> A debate is needed on third level governance.  As the Minister said, this legislation seeks to bring the statutory framework for the HEA up to date, given that the current legislation is 50 years old and has been in place since 1971.  We need to acknowledge that despite the need to update that legislation, the higher education sector has played a major role in the development of our society and country.  The contribution made by academics from all colleges and universities to civic engagement and public service has been immense.  We have seen that throughout the pandemic but also long before it.  For that reason, it is critical that this legislation must emphasise the principles of autonomy and academic freedom that have served us so well.  We need to be very clear that in bringing our statutory framework for higher education governance up to date we are not creating more problems, in particular by creating a one-size-fits-all model that is overly bureaucratic and treats all higher education institutions as alike when they are patently not.  It is very good and very positive that the differences are acknowledged in the legislation.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred to the different sectoral Acts.  The universities Act is very different from the legislation under the 2018 Act that set up what are now the technological universities.  Even within the university sector, Trinity College has a very unique governance structure that is acknowledged by the Minister and the legislation.  Concerns around preserving autonomy of institutions must be addressed and brought into the legislation.  There are very legitimate concerns among many of the higher education institutions, universities and colleges about a lack of regard for autonomy and difference and too much centralising of power with the Minister.  Consequently, that could have a detrimental effect on academic freedom and creativity and could see a stifling of the kind of creative endeavour that has brought so much value, not just monetary but social, to our country.  That is very important.<\/p> <p> There is much to welcome in the legislation.  Clearly, the greater emphasis on the role of apprenticeships, and the need to update and modernise governance structures for apprenticeships and training, is very important.  We would all acknowledge that, but it is also valid to speak of particular concerns.  I might go through a few specific ones.  I know we will speak more about them on Committee Stage.  Conradh na Gaeilge has raised concerns about an insufficient emphasis on the Irish language, which is one particular point.  While the provisions in sections 15 and 16 for the composition of the board of the HEA to be gender balanced are welcome, there is still a missed opportunity to create more provisions around recognition of diversity other than gender diversity.  For example, if only one board member has direct experience of conditions for students, that may not be sufficient to represent the experiences of perhaps the most important stakeholders in this sector.  That is crucial.<\/p> <p> We also need to ensure the legislation provides adequately for the views of academic staff, research staff and others to be heard.  Trade union representation is crucial too.  There is a frustration for many in the sector who feel they might be demoted to poorly defined stakeholders and that their concerns might not carry the same weight as others at the table whose voices are more clearly enshrined in the law.  Having due consideration to equality, diversity and inclusion should come through and underlie all the provisions in the legislation, especially those around board membership for the HEA.<\/p> <p> There are also issues around the tone of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700052#CCC00500","speaker":"1698","continuing":true}]
