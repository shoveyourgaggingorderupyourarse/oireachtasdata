He is accompanied by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Farrell.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is minutes.  We are dealing with minutes from a number of previous meetings that have been circulated.  I refer to the minutes of the meetings on 11, 18 and 25 October and on 15 and 22 November.  There is one slight change of wording to be made to the minutes of the meeting on 8 November, as circulated.  I will ask the clerk to the committee to make that one change and re-circulate.  I propose we note the minutes.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  If members have matters arising out of the minutes, they might hold them over until next week as they will have an opportunity to go through them.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  The two items, correspondence Nos. 1771 A and 1772 A, dated 4 November, from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, provide briefing material and an opening statement for today's meeting.  I propose we note and publish those documents.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We also have No. 1777 A, dated 5 November, from the same Department, providing further briefing material for today's meeting.  We have been asked not to publish No. 1777 A and I propose we agree to that request, at least for the moment.  I propose we note No. 1777 A.  It has been circulated to the committee.  Inevitably, it will be discussed here today.  On the question of publication of that document, it may contain confidential, commercially sensitive information.  We can come back to it.  For now, I propose we note, but not publish, it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It seems daft that we can raise anything in a document that we are then not going to publish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#B00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We will discuss with the Department what particular aspect it has an issue with publishing.

We will not publish it at this stage.<\/p><p>The next item of correspondence is in category B - correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to previous Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  There is one item, No. 1703 B, held over from the previous meeting.  It is from the CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, dated 2 November 2018, in relation to a request from the committee for a copy of its report arising from the value for money review of Irish Public Bodies.  The report is subject to a non-disclosure agreement between LGMA, Irish public bodies and PricewaterhouseCoopers dated 2 September 2015.  The CEO has written to Irish Public Bodies, IPB, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, to request their consent for LGMA to release the report to the committee and is awaiting a response.  We will keep the committee updated on that.  For now, I propose we note and publish that response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>Correspondence No. 1753 B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, provides an information note requested by the committee on former Console staff.  This is an important piece of correspondence that we want to deal with, if we can call it up on the screens.  Essentially, we had asked that compensation be made available on an <i>ex-gratia<\/i>basis to staff who were not re-employed.  We included it as a recommendation in a previous periodic report.  We also asked the Minister to examine the matter.  The response is good and I want to put it on the public record.  The HSE states that it understands from Pieta House there were 55 pre-existing employees of Console in 2016.  The HSE confirmed that it offered 52 contracts to staff previously employed by Console.  This comprised ten employees of Console and 42 persons, mainly counsellors, on contracts for services or sessional work with Console.  Pieta House did not offer contracts to three former Console employees, who included the former CEO and two others who decided to seek employment elsewhere.  Of the 52 contracts that were offered by Pieta House, 47 contracts were accepted comprising ten employees and 37 contracts for service sessional work.  Effectively, Pieta House has done as much as the committee was looking for on this.  A couple of people who did not work there, and, obviously, the CEO, were not offered contracts.  They offered contracts to everybody else, most of whom took them up.  As for those who chose to work elsewhere, that is their own affair.  It took a long time to get to that point.  We have been following this for quite a long time.  I acknowledge that it is good to receive that information at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Can I clarify one point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#B00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I think I am right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#B00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Chairman probably is right.

Deputy Connolly has pointed out an obvious issue.  We will ask for clarification on that point.  If it is as it appears, that is great.  If there is a subtle distinction in the letter that the Deputy has spotted, we need to know about it.  We will ask for confirmation of that particular point.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1754 B from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 27 November 2018, providing information notes requested by the committee on a variety of points that we raised with him at the previous meeting.  We will have a second meeting on the housing issue in the new year.  Mr. McCarthy follows up on a number of issues.  These are the new regulations for short-term lettings; transfer of funds; the prevention of emergency accommodation being used for families; differential rents which accrued to local authorities; findings of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive; funding of family hub accommodation; breakdown of housing expenditure in 2017 and 2018; regeneration programme details; projected number of homes that could be accommodated on local authority housing lands and the extent of loans attached; children in emergency accommodation; annual assessment of social housing applications received by each local authority and the targets set; different organisations and capital loan schemes in the context of the amounts outstanding, capital advance leasing facilities etc. and where there is an overlap of functions of agencies; credit policy governing loan approval, with reference to separated couples; and lending arrangements in place for approved housing bodies.<\/p><p>That will be useful feeding into our meeting and report on housing in the new year.  We will certainly note and publish the correspondence for now.  We will hold the matter over for discussion on that day.<\/p><p> There is, however, one issue that is wholly unsatisfactory.  I specifically tabled parliamentary questions asking about the credit policy used by local authorities to determine whether a person is eligible for a loan under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  We all know that approximately 50% of people who apply do not get it.  Many Deputies have raised the matter.  I raised the matter as a Topical Issue and through parliamentary questions.  I was told the matter was confidential and commercially sensitive.  I was told the requested information could not be released and so on.  When the Secretary General was before the committee we asked him for a copy of the document.  If it is the basis on which taxpayers' money is being advanced to people who are purchasing loans, then we are entitled to see the nature of it.<\/p><p> The Secretary General has given us a document.  The reference number is 1754 and it is document number 4 in that group.  I wish to put on record that this document is totally unsatisfactory and I want the public to know the response we got from the Department.  Committee members can bring up the document on their screens.  Pages 1 to 3 are fine.  Then, we get to page 4.  There are already redactions relating to fixed rate loans and variable rate loans.  Two paragraphs are fully redacted.  That is unacceptable from our point of view.  Page 5 seems fine.  Page 6 contains serious redaction and we do not know what it is about.  Those responsible have blanked out page 7 in its entirety.  Page 8 has serious redaction relating to the source of the applicant's equity.  Page 9 has another serious redaction relating to the employed applicants.  There is another serious redaction on page 9 relating to self-employed applicants.  Page 10 seems okay.  They have blanked out pages 11, 12 and 13 entirely.  Page 14 seems okay.  Pages 15, 16 and 17 are fine.  Page 18 is blanked out in its entirety.  Page 19 is substantially redacted and blanked out.  Page 20 is blanked out in the section dealing with exceptions to policy.  People would like to know what the exceptions are.  There is an evaluation report at the end and explanatory notes as well.<\/p><p> Information was sought by the Committee of Public Accounts in the interests of the public from the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government relating to the credit policy for 2018, which is drawn up under SI 25 of 2018.  The response is wholly and totally unacceptable.  We have been told that traditionally the Department does not give people access to credit policies and banks may not make such policy.  However, in this situation what is at issue is public money.  We are going back to ask the Department to reconsider the matter and provide more detail.  We are going back to ask for the full unredacted copy to be supplied to us.<\/p><p> If the Secretary General has issues in that regard he should, in respect of each redaction, give the specific reason he has chosen to redact each sentence as well as the pages that are blank.  Half of the document has been blanked out.  It is no way for an Accounting Officer to treat the Committee of Public Accounts.  I hope he gets that message.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> I am amazed because this is my fourth attempt to see the document.  People will know that, especially with 50% refusal, there is much in the blanked out document that is preventing the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme from achieving what we and the public believe it was meant to achieve in the first place.  Anyway, I have made the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#B01800","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I wish to make one point on the home loan scheme.  I agree with all that you have said, Chairman, in respect of understanding the workings of the scheme.  There are people who have gone through the whole system but still have not been allocated a loan, because the local authority has to negotiate with the Department.  It seems that each local authority has to do it.  We have found this in Kildare and perhaps you find the same in Laois, Chairman.  We find that there many applications to buy coming from other counties.  We might have more because of value or the price of houses.  Anyway, some people have got through the whole system but the money is not available to allow the mortgage to go ahead.  It is inhibiting a good scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#C00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I wish to make a broader point &ndash; I will conclude on this &ndash; on the concept of having a credit policy drafted by the Department to be implemented by 31 different local authorities, 31 different housing officers and all the staff under them.  All those involved have varying levels of training on how to process applications.  Some counties have small numbers while others have big numbers.  The expertise within the local authorities cannot be consistent throughout the country, almost by definition.  I am not calling for the administration to be centralised but we are guaranteed inconsistency in the delivery of the scheme if it is being farmed out to 31 local authorities.  We all know it.  The staff who are administering the scheme were probably in the motor tax office last year, in the planning department the year before and in water services the year before that.  They may not have spent time in the housing or finance department, as the case may be.  We do not necessarily have people with financial competence in the area of granting loans or dealing with applications in the various local authorities.  Consistency is another issue.  I am sorry but committee members can see that I am annoyed by this.

Committee members will see the net need figures.  There is an inset with the information.  The figures on the waiting list have reduced.  The total number of qualified households in 2018 has reduced significantly from 2017.  That should be a good news story but it is important to clarify this.  Let us consider the criteria set out on the page.  Who is left out of the assessment?  Anyone receiving the housing assistance payment is left out of the assessment.  We know the figures for HAP doubled last year and the allocation became &euro;300 million.  The figure for next year will be &euro;431 million.  Those in receipt are in the private market with no security of tenure.  It is costing a fortune in taxpayers' money &ndash; that is why we are mentioning it.  They are excluded completely and so are those in the rental accommodation scheme.  It is the exclusion of people who are still in need.  That is really what is difficult.  They are on a waiting list but when they go into these schemes they are off the waiting list but they are put on a transfer list.<\/p> <p>  I know we abolished limbo, but limbo is alive and well somewhere in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

It does not state how many of the individual cases have been dealt with so far, which is the substantive question that was asked.  A total of 157 cases need to be examined.  We do not have any detailed analysis.  The letter states ongoing detailed analysis is being done.  What detailed analysis?  How many cases have been done?<\/p> <p>  What is more important for me is that it seems to suggest this issue has to do with individuals, that it is being looking at on a case-by-case basis and there is a review of each individual case.  Where is the review of management practices?  Where is the review of HR practices?  These 157 people found themselves on self-employed contracts.  We had a hearing and we heard from RT&Eacute;.  Even one of the RT&Eacute; presenters who had been speaking to staff said these people were not given a choice.  They found themselves on these contracts and not because they wanted them.  This is not about putting the responsibility back on the 157 individuals.  The question is why were they put in that position.  Was it a management practice by RT&Eacute;?  Are HR issues raised here?<\/p> <p>  It is disingenuous, to say the least, to try to suggest in the letter that the issue needs to be resolved by looking at it on an individual case-by-case basis.  Potentially, it was a more systemic managerial issue that led to these people being on these contracts in the first place.  The letter does not give us the information we sought, which is how many of the 157 cases have been dealt with and how many people have been spoken to.  This needs to be done to determine whether they should now be on proper contracts.  Where is the review of the management of RT&Eacute; and its HR processes?  We need to get this.

The complainant believes the committee raised the matter of presidential expenses in order that it would become an issue in the election and be used as a weapon to damage the chances of the incumbent being re-elected.  As Chairman, I reject that entirely.  We will note and publish the item.<\/p><p>We have not been asked by the Committee on Procedure to respond to that letter, but we may choose next week to respond or to note and publish it.  If it identifies the private citizen who has made the complaint about the Committee on Public Accounts we will ensure that his or her name, or any information that could identify him or her, is redacted but I think we should publish the substance of the complaint.  We are big enough to take complaints on the chin and we will not publish them.  People often make remarks that we may or may not agree with.  I will ask the secretariat to scrutinise the letter to ensure there is nothing therein which if published would identify the correspondent.  I would like the substance of the complaint published even though it is not flattering from the committee's point of view.  We may decide to respond or not, as the case may be, next week.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#E02800","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>When the secretariat has had an opportunity to review it we can come back to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#F00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Yes, we will hold it over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#F00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The final paragraph of the letter does not make any sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#F00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Exactly.

We will note and publish this correspondence, which makes for detailed reading in regard to the ETBs.  According to the correspondence, which I read yesterday, the ETBs were established in 2013 and they hope to commence phased implementation of the payroll shared service next year and to commence phased implementation of the financial shared services system in 2020.  Seven years after these organisations were established they are only centralising these services.  They accept that the number of people in the internal audit function, which is based in Cavan, is not sufficient and they had recruited a number of additional staff but three of them left because the amount of time spent travelling from Cavan to Waterford, Wexford and Cork and so on did not suit them.  They now have a minimal staff complement, with three staff on contract from a consultancy company.  They accept that they did not have adequate internal audit facilities available in 2017.  It is a factual letter, setting out the position warts and all, acknowledging failures and the difficulties involved in terms of making improvements.  They also acknowledge how long it has taken to get to this point since the establishment of the ETBs in 2013, which is a lesson we are learning for all new public bodies.  There was a similar issue with the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission.  When a body is being established nobody comprehends there will be an increase in workload.  This is a previous example that also is coming back to haunt us. <\/p><p>The ETBs have appeared before us previously.  They have moved from only one having its accounts for audit within three months of the year-end to all now being on time.  We met four of them recently, when we highlighted this issue extensively.  The ETB network in Ireland has acknowledged the work of the Committee of Public Accounts in putting pressure on the Department of Education and Skills to provide additional resources and so on.  We have achieved a lot in this sector.  <\/p><p>Would Mr. McCarthy like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#F01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544086800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>In regard to the 2017 accounts, a lot of the ETBs are drawing attention to the difficulties around the financial management systems and the inadequacy of internal audit resources.

As the Chairman said, it is good to have that type of information at a co-ordinated level.

Currently, legislation is being drafted to give organisations the statutory powers to establish a board and hire a chief executive, with no detail as to who is to do the job.

This was distributed across six expenditure programmes of varying size.  Figure 1, which will appear on screen, indicates how the expenditure under the Vote was divided between the programmes.  Members may wish to note that, in addition, the Department is responsible for management of the environment fund, which is funded from levies on the landfill of waste and on plastic bag usage and accounted for separately from the Vote. <\/p> <p>  The largest expenditure programme was in relation to broadcasting, accounting for &euro;254 million or more than half of the total spent in 2017.  That programme was substantially funded by television licence fee receipts, which totalled just over &euro;215 million in 2017.  Most of the expenditure under the programme was in the form of grants of almost &euro;185 million to RT&Eacute; and &euro;34 million to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge.  A total of &euro;14 million was paid into the broadcasting fund and just under &euro;12 million was paid to An Post in respect of its costs for collecting television licence fees on behalf of the Department. <\/p> <p>  The Department spent &euro;111 million on the energy programme in 2017, of which &euro;90 million was expended on energy efficiency programmes promoted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  This was a substantial increase from &euro;66 million spent in 2016. <\/p> <p>  The Department spent over &euro;50 million on the environment and waste management programme in 2017, more than half of which went to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition, the Department spent over &euro;33 million on environmental projects and initiatives from the environment fund in 2017. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the communications programme in 2017 was &euro;31.5 million.  This included expenditure on the procurement process for the national broadband plan. <\/p> <p>  The Department spent just over &euro;30 million under the inland fisheries programme, mainly in grant support for Inland Fisheries Ireland.<\/p><p>Finally, almost &euro;25 million was spent on a range of services covered by the natural resources programme.  Nearly 60% of that expenditure related to the specialist functions and services of the Geological Survey of Ireland.  The net expenditure on the Vote was around &euro;32 million less than was provided for in the 2017 Estimate.  The Department got the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;6 million in unspent capital funding to 2018.  The balance of &euro;26 million was due for surrender.<\/p><p> This brief outline of its 2017 expenditure illustrates that the Department funds oversees a broad range of functions, public sector bodies or both, including major commercial State bodies which do not receive ongoing grant funding such as An Post, EirGrid, the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.  Given the scope of the Department&rsquo;s remit, I have included for the committee&rsquo;s information a diagram which aims to summarise the public bodies within the Department&rsquo;s aegis, indicating those which I audit and those which are outside my remit.<\/p><p> A key feature of the Department&rsquo;s remit is the long-term nature of many of the issues for which it takes lead responsibility.  The chapters for consideration today deal with aspects of two such issues, namely, cybersecurity and sustainable energy.<\/p><p> The energy efficiency national fund was established in 2014, using funds of &euro;35 million from the carbon revenue levy, which had been discontinued.  The fund is not accounted for separately but the Department presents a summary of the results for the fund in note 7.2 of the appropriation accounts.  The objectives of the fund are to provide financing to support energy efficiency improvement programmes and measures, as well as to promote the development of a market for energy efficiency improvement measures.<\/p><p> Rather than investing directly in energy efficiency projects, the Department decided to establish a qualifying investor fund, QIF, managed by fund advisers.  The QIF pooled this funding with private sector funds.  The Department committed to investing up to the full fund amount of &euro;35 million in the QIF.  As of March 2018, private investors had committed up to &euro;38.8 million.  At the time of the finalisation of the chapter, the anticipated investment in energy efficiency projects had not been achieved.<\/p><p> It was originally envisaged the QIF would invest in projects from its establishment in May 2014 up to May 2017.  The shareholder agreement made provision for this investment period to be extended to May 2018, of which this was availed.  When the agreed investment period closed, the Department had transferred a total of &euro;14 million to the QIF, including &euro;10.8 million contributed only in May 2018, in anticipation of delivery of projects in planning.<\/p><p> The funds transferred are used to finance energy efficiency projects and to fund the fees and expenses of the QIF.  Based on the State&rsquo;s percentage shareholding in the QIF, the examination estimated that around &euro;2 million of the State&rsquo;s contribution was used to pay fees and expenses.  The value of the State&rsquo;s investment into the future is not known.<\/p><p> The Department has stated there would be no further transfers from the fund to the QIF and that the balance of &euro;21 million remaining in the fund will be transferred to the climate action fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The underspend related primarily to lower than expected expenditure on certain demand-led sustainable energy schemes, the delayed commencement of landfill remediation projects, the national broadband plan, as well as reduced broadcasting expenditure due to lower than forecasted TV licence receipts.  In addition, expenditure of &euro;33 million under the environment fund in 2017 supported further progress in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable development and waste management.<\/p> <p>  The Department has a key policy development and co-ordination role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy.  Ireland's first statutory national mitigation plan, published in July 2017, sets out a whole-of-Government approach to tackling greenhouse gas emissions in key sectors, including electricity generation, transport, agriculture and the built environment.  Ireland&rsquo;s first national adaptation framework, approved by the Government in December 2017, sets out our strategy for adaptation measures to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change, and also to avail of any positive effects which may occur.<\/p> <p>  Using less energy, and using it more efficiently, is the most cost effective and accessible way to take action on climate change.  The Department invested a total of &euro;105 million under its energy programme area in 2017.  Of this, capital expenditure of &euro;80 million supported energy efficiency measures in more than 23,500 homes and 491 public, private and commercial buildings, while also supporting around 2,670 jobs across the country.  In tandem with this, measures aimed at decarbonising electricity generation and promoting the electrification of heat and transport were progressed.  Last year saw the approval of two key support schemes for renewable heat and renewable electricity, respectively, with the latter providing pathways and measures to ensure increased community and citizen participation.  Over 900 new electric vehicles were grant-aided in 2017, as we move forward to ensure all new cars and vans sold will be zero emissions, or zero emissions capable by 2030.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has prepared a chapter with the 2017 appropriation accounts dealing with the national energy efficiency fund.  The fund served to stimulate the market for large scale energy efficiency projects and leverage private investment in this area, at a time when such investment was not evident.  The role of the fund should be seen in the broader context of Exchequer investment in energy efficiency over the past few years.  The greater proportion of the &euro;21 million remaining in this fund will now be diverted to stimulate innovative investments by public and private sector entities under the new climate action fund to further support the decarbonisation effort.  Last week we had the first announcement of seven schemes to be supported by the fund.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;26 million of the Department&rsquo;s allocation was spent on communications, multimedia developments and the information society in 2017.  Within this, expenditure to support digital entrepreneurship and to promote digital inclusion among small businesses and citizens under the national digital strategy amounted to &euro;9.4 million.<\/p> <p>  During 2017, the Department continued to progress the procurement process under the national broadband plan, while commercial investment in high-speed broadband services continued to expand.  Overall, 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in the country had access to quality services at year end.  The overarching policy objective of the plan is to deliver this vital service to the homes, schools, farms and businesses for the 1.1 million people across rural Ireland who will not be provided this service by the commercial sector.  It remains a key priority for the Department.  We have now entered into the final assessment stage of the procurement, with a view to making a recommendation to the Government within the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  In other sectorial areas covered by the Department, funding to support public service broadcasting amounted to &euro;253 million in 2017.  Investment of over &euro;91 million was targeted at the sustainable management of our natural resources and inland fisheries, the protection of our natural environment and the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to assisting the committee members with any questions they may have today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mark Griffin for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#K00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>As I have many questions this morning, I would like fairly short replies.

Of course, I am not saying that is the case or that the witnesses would agree with it because I am just talking about perceptions.  There is a perception problem and it all seems to be a bit of a mess.  Those for whom I have most concern are the people living in rural Ireland who want connectivity.

We had extensive discussions with Eir on its commitment to do so and with the European Commission on the latitude available to the Government not to accept the 300,000 households as part of a separate deployment measure.  The clear response we received from the European Commission was that under state aid rules, where there was a commitment agreement in place, with clear targets and deliverable outcomes and so on, the option was not available to the State to decline it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#W03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I might perhaps come at it from a different philosophical and ideological viewpoint in that I do not think the State should intervene only when the market fails.

Did we arrive at that position because of all of the other decisions that were made, including the taking out of the 300,000 homes and businesses from the original plan, which possibly made it less viable for other bidders?

However, it could not develop a competitive business case to justify continued participation in the national broadband plan.  I cannot say whether that was related to the 300,000 homes and businesses or other things.  Eir withdrew in January 2017.  It raised issues around the complexity of the procurement process for which I make no apologies because when we are talking about the State providing a very substantial subsidy, we must make sure our procurement process is robust and the things we are asking commercial companies to do stand up in terms of the obligation we are imposing on them over a 25-year period.  Eir indicated at the time that it would continue to support the national broadband plan.  We are seeing this in practice in terms of the engagement with the final bidder in terms of the make ready programme.  The question that arises for us in developing a recommendation one way or the other for the Minister and Government is whether it has the technical capacity, whether the business plan stands up, whether it is commercial and whether the bidder will live up to all the contractual obligations that will be imposed.<\/p> <p>  Regarding competitive tension, it is probably worth mentioning that part of the competitive dialogue process is what it is called the ISDA S phase, which is the invitation to submit detailed submissions.

The Department has it.  It has some indication of what it might be but we have no idea how much it will cost in the long run even though it is taxpayers' money.

There is a perception, and I stress that it is only a perception, that the process is contaminated and that the report into this is a whitewash.  Leaving aside this public perception and media or political commentary, many meetings took place between the former Minister and Mr. McCourt.  It was put to Mr. Griffin earlier by Deputy MacSharry that it is reasonable for members of this committee to ask him as the person who ultimately signs the cheque, and he does not know or least we do not know how much he will sign for, whether it was appropriate for the former Minister to have had that level of contact with somebody so closely associated with the only bidder in the game, about which we spoke earlier.  I put this question again to Mr. Griffin because I was not satisfied with the response.  This committee deserves a response to that question.  Mr. Griffin is the Secretary General and the buck stops with him.  Surely when he saw the number of meetings that took place between the former Minister and Mr. McCourt, he would have formed an opinion.

The first round of speakers made their contributions before the break and I have a few other questions to ask.  We are joined for the afternoon session by Mr. James Ryan from the Department of Defence and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, assistant commissioner, security and intelligence, and Mr. Michael Gubbins, Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau.  We will be dealing with the issue of cyber security during the course of the meeting, although not yet.  I advise the new witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by members of the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.<\/p><p>To return to Mr. Griffin, there are a few issues I wish to raise.  I will return to broadband provision, given that it is the topic of the moment, even though there are other issues arising from the full Vote before us.  I have three questions about the appropriation account for the purposes of clarification.  Before the break, we touched on inland fisheries which are dealt with on page 6.  Page 13 has a heading which refers to contingent liabilities.  It states there is potential for financial liabilities to arise in 2018 and subsequent years, depending on the outcome of current pending and possible future EU and other legal actions.  What current cases are referred to?  Is there a list or schedule?  Obviously, Mr. Griffin cannot talk about future cases that have not yet arisen, but perhaps he might tell the committee about current and pending cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#HH00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544086800,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the Department has to deal with a range of court cases at any particular time in which it is either a defendant or a notice party.

We do not have EU infringement cases likely to give rise to a penalty in the short term, but given the level of activity on issues being negotiated at EU level and agreed, directives or regulations which fall to be transposed on certain occasions and EU measures to be implemented, it is something on which we always have to keep a close eye.  We do this as part of the work of the management board and aim to deliver on the objectives of the directive or regulations in transposition or implementation.

The committee will see, in Table 2, a smaller number of sites where the certification of authorisation, COA, is under consideration by the EPA with remediation works programme for 2019.

The point was made earlier, and referenced recently by the head of Vodafone Ireland during its recent 5G trial, about 5G being complementary to high speed broadband.  This is about connectivity not only within one's house or place of work but outside one's door.  The engineers will probably be upset with how I am explaining this but as I see it 5G and fibre are very fast but in terms of any expected roll-out of 5G the capacity and the amount of data are not comparable.  5G can expand out but this would require investment at a level that no commercial player would consider sensible - with more electronics en masse.  The Secretary General mentioned earlier that in the recently published ComReg estimates it would cost &euro;1.8 billion to achieve 99% plus population coverage with 5G.  This would provide a level of service such that a person could watch Netflix, but not if all of his or her neighbours chose to watch Netflix at the same time.  That is the difference between 5G and fibre.  With fibre, one has a dedicated signal.  The two can work together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#MM00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":1168,"content":"<p>Let us park broadband for now.  Mobile phones have been around for 25 years.  This conversation about black spots could and should have been had by the Department 15 years ago.  Some of the black spots identified ten years ago are still black spots today.  I would contend that the principal cause of the problem in regard to mobile phone coverage is the State in allowing companies granted licences to provide less than optimal levels of cover.  If a licence specifies 75% cover, it is not the fault of the company if it only meets that requirement, rather it is the fault of the State for setting the coverage requirement at that level.  If a licence granted today requires an operator to provide only 75% coverage then in 15 years' time there will be lots of people complaining about not having a service.  The reason we do not have the coverage is because the licence does not require it.  If the licence required 100% coverage, that is what we would get.<\/p> <p>  I would like information from the Department on the operators, their licensing arrangements and the percentage of coverage by population and geographically over the lifetime of their renewals.  I believe that when these operators were first granted these licences the percentage of coverage required was higher than is the case in the more recently issued licences.  It could have been 90% but was reduced in new iterations to 80%, 78% and so on.  This enables operators to cherry pick areas geographically.  This was not only aided and abetted by the State but forced on the people by the State by not holding operators to a higher standard from day one.  I accept that the Department is on a learning curve as a result of this failure and that it does not want to be caught with the same problem with broadband but we will come to that in a minute.  Twenty-five years on, there are far too many black spots.  I ask that the Department send to the committee data on the percentage of the population geographically in black spots.  It is all very fine to talk about plans, communications and understanding the problem.  The dogs in the street could have done that a decade ago. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#MM00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544086800,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>As part of the process, we are working with the local authorities to identify infrastructure that can be used to site masts and repeaters.

In other words, is it a population focus or a geographic focus and what are the costs involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#MM00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":1170,"content":"<p>I understand that.

It is not okay to say just because we cannot meet 100% we cannot have a discussion on the issue.  We need to increase the level of coverage.  I ask that the Department forward to the committee data on the renewals.  ComReg is supposed to audit a random number of the masts annually to ensure the level of coverage promised is being met.

In public private partnerships, PPPs, the funding model for the motorways, at the end of what we will call the concession period of 25 years it is up to the company that builds the motorway to give the road back to the State in the same condition it was on the first day.

I am boring myself in saying this.  In Galway we have come full circle.  I hear the Department is looking at the ambassador scheme which was not fully drawn down.  When I look at that, it is difficult not to despair.  We had a pilot recycling scheme in Galway and achieved 70%.  If the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment were to learn anything, it might look at what Galway achieved against the engineers' advice and that of others.  They told us 45%.  There were definitely serious questions about where it was going.  However, it showed that people wanted to recycle and they led the way.  The official response was to privatise.<\/p> <p>  I am reading about an ambassador scheme that is struggling.  Nobody is drawing down the funding.  The local authority had an education liaison officer who worked with the people.  All of this was there.  Here we are in 2018, certainly 15 or 16 years later and the officials are telling us about recycling when we already did it.  A public composting facility was sold off or leased off.  I will not dwell on it, but it is difficult to listen to, especially when the people have led us and shown us what was possible.

Critical systems and infrastructure at risk include those owned and managed by both public and private bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Department is responsible for the development of cybersecurity policy in Ireland, and for co-ordinating emergency responses to any national-level cybersecurity incidents.  The national cybersecurity centre was established within the Department in 2011 to address those responsibilities.  The examination was undertaken to review the progress made since the establishment of the centre.<\/p> <p>  The examination notes that the centre&rsquo;s level of resourcing in its first four years of operation was significantly less than envisaged when the Government was asked to approve the establishment of the centre.  The overall cost attributed to cybersecurity functions is not reported separately in the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account.  As a result, there is a lack of transparency around the availability and use of resources.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, the Department published a national cybersecurity strategy covering the period 2015 to 2017.  Not all of the measures in that strategy were achieved.  There is no national cybersecurity strategic plan currently in place.<\/p> <p>  At the time the strategy was published, it was planned that the overarching governance structure of the centre would be a high-level interdepartmental steering group that would oversee its work.  The Department stated during the examination that the steering group had not met since the strategy was published in 2015.<\/p> <p>  In July 2016, the European Union adopted the directive on security of network and information systems with a view to achieving a common high level of cybersecurity within the EU.  Transposition of the directive into Irish law was achieved in September 2018.  However, a requirement of the directive is to adopt a national strategy that contains elements such as a risk assessment plan, a listing of various stakeholders and a governance framework.  In the absence of a strategy, the Department is not meeting its requirements under the directive.<\/p> <p>  A number of recommendations relating to resourcing, transparency of costs, governance and strategic direction were included in the chapter.  All the recommendations were agreed by the Accounting Officer who will be able to give the committee an update on their implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#XX03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1544086800,"counter":1628,"content":"<p>Mr. Griffin held over a paragraph of his contribution this morning dealing with cybersecurity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018120600002#XX03800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544086800,"counter":1629,"content":"<p>I am happy to have that put on the record rather than reading through it.

For those seven sectors, what we are obliged to do, along with one other national competent authority, is to identify which entities we regard as being important.  We then oblige those entities to meet security standards and to report serious incidents to the NCSC.  That is the OES, or critical infrastructure, area.  The other area is DSPs, or digital service providers.  These are limited to three different sectors, namely, cloud computing, online sales platforms - that is, a platform that sells from A to B - and search engines.  Those platforms have a different set of requirements.  We are not obliged to designate those and, in fact, we cannot designate them.  They are obliged to be self-designating and they are designated by definition in the directive and in our regulations.  They are obliged to meet a set of security standards, not ours but ones that are set broadly in the EU implementing regulation.  They are obliged to report incidents to us and the thresholds for reporting of those incidents are also set in parts 3 and 4 of that same EU implementing regulation.<\/p> <p>  Those are the requirements laid on those entities.  We then have further requirements in terms of reporting to other EU member states and they to us in terms of incidents that are reported to us from both OES and DSPs.  If, for example, an OES has operations in multiple member states and it is affected by an incident here that may have implications elsewhere, which could happen in this State given we have cross-border infrastructure in a number of sectors, we are then obliged to report to that other member state any outage or incident in that sector with regard to a specific OES.  The same applies for DSPs.  If for example, a DSP is based here at the European level and has an outage or incident of a given scale and it reports that incident to us, we are obliged to report to the single points of contact in every other member state which has a population that may be affected by that same incident.<\/p><p>Other states have reporting obligations to us and we have reporting obligations to them.

In financial services and credit institutions - those two out of seven - is that the Central Bank has designated entities where it has said an entity is now an OES but it has disapplied the security measures.

Cormac will make opening remarks on behalf of Pepper.<\/p> <p>  We are here to discuss Project Glenbeigh, which we concluded on this day last week.  In this regard, we recognise that non-performing loan, NPL, transactions attract considerable attention and are of real interest to the committee.  As a result, as soon as we announced the deal last Thursday, Cormac and I wrote to the Chairman to offer to meet with the committee to discuss the transaction.  We have circulated a schematic which details the key elements of the transaction.  As the committee knows, Project Glenbeigh is the second major transaction undertaken by the bank this year to reduce the ratio of NPLs on its balance sheet.  At the start of this year, that ratio stood at approximately 26%.  Together, the transactions will see the ratio fall to below 10%, a significant improvement which will strengthen the bank by enabling it to withstand future economic shock and increase its ability to compete strongly in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  This latest transaction had been signalled by the bank for some time.  When we met with the committee in October, we confirmed we were considering options for a substantial NPL loan portfolio and that we hoped to conclude the transaction within months.  In addition, we told the committee we were examining various capital market options including securitisation.  In the end, we chose securitisation, the option which is particularly suitable in this instance as the portfolio is made up exclusively of borrowers whose loans are non-performing by reference to the guidance and definitions set down by the regulatory authorities but who are meeting the terms of restructuring arrangements which have been agreed between the account holders and the bank.  The customers are engaging, have a proven record of meeting the terms of restructuring agreements and generate a steady stream of cashflow.  <\/p> <p>  In considering options for the portfolio, we had a number of priorities.  First, we wanted to explore all the alternatives for the portfolio.  These included a further loan sale and, as discussed at the bank&rsquo;s last appearance before the committee, to provide for, and then derecognise, the loans.  The loan sale option was discounted due to the characteristics of the portfolio of loans.  The provide-and-derecognise option was discounted due to the high capital cost to the taxpayer and the question marks remaining as to whether derecognition would be forthcoming.  This led us to the preferred alternative of a capital markets solution.<\/p> <p>  Second, we were mindful of our responsibilities to customers whose loans are included in the transaction and, therefore, we wanted to source a capital markets solution that maintained the long-term treatments they had agreed with the bank.  In seeking to keep as many customers in their homes as possible through the crisis, PTSB offered the split mortgage and part capital and interest treatments widely.  By comparison, to our knowledge, Bank of Ireland did not offer the split mortgage treatment at all, while PTSB offered a far greater number of split mortgages than AIB.<\/p><p>According to published accounts, split mortgages only make up 6% of forborne loans at AIB whereas in PTSB it is 24%.  In addition, PTSB has warehoused up to 80% of the debt in some cases.  This is important since, in the SSM's NPL guidance, 20% is the level above which the warehouse and main mortgage are deemed to be connected thereby rendering it a non-performing loan.<\/p><p> We wanted to attract credible investors who will hold the notes issued by the securitisation vehicle for the long term.  We have achieved that by focusing the transaction on loans that are adhering to the terms of restructuring agreements and producing consistent, predictable cash flow.  This makes the securitisation vehicle an attractive proposition for long-term investors.  We wanted to ensure that the restructuring agreements, which had been agreed and overseen by Permanent TSB, would be respected under the securitisation alternative.  We have achieved that by ensuring the agreed restructuring arrangements form part of the terms and conditions of the individual loans that are included in the transaction.  <\/p><p> The bank was advised that it would not be granted NPL derecognition status for these loans if it maintained the servicing relationship.  Therefore, we wanted to ensure the company appointed to service and administer the loans going forward would be credible and respected.  We have achieved that with the appointment of Pepper Ireland.  I will let Mr. Ryan detail Pepper&rsquo;s credentials but we were attracted, in particular, by the fact Pepper is regulated and authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland under the Central Bank Act 1997 as a retail credit firm for the provision of credit and credit servicing activities in Ireland.  The company has been in Ireland since 2012, employs over 380 people in Shannon and Dublin and, including the accounts included in this transaction, manages some &euro;10 billion of Irish residential mortgage loans.  In short, Pepper is a well-established and important part of the financial services infrastructure in Ireland.   <\/p><p> We wanted to ensure the bank&rsquo;s customers understood what was happening with their loans and the implications the securitisation might have.  We have achieved this by writing to all the relevant account-holders outlining answers to common questions, providing additional information online and encouraging customers to contact our support staff to discuss any issues they may have.   <\/p><p> We wanted to ensure that scheduled reviews of any restructuring arrangement treated customers fairly.  Mr. Ryan will outline how Pepper will approach this process but I will make a number of points.  Under the master servicing agreement, MSA, Pepper, as the master servicer, has the full power, authority and right to undertake all activities it reasonably considers necessary, convenient or incidental to the provision of the services under the MSA.  The securitisation vehicle itself has, effectively, legally delegated these decision-making rights to the master servicer as the Irish-regulated entity.  A review mechanism is commonplace in all restructuring agreements.  If the loans had remained with Permanent TSB, the bank would undertake reviews with the same objectives Pepper will have in the future.  If the circumstances of the borrower have not changed, there is a legal obligation to continue to comply with the terms of an existing restructured arrangement.  This is an important overlay as the bank set out to maximise customer protection.  If the circumstances of a borrower have changed, either positively or negatively, then, as would be the case with Permanent TSB, the arrangements may be reviewed to reflect the changed circumstances of the borrower.  In this regard, it is worth bearing in mind the restructuring arrangements in place all involve the agreed suspension of repayments on a significant amount of the money borrowed by the customer.  Those warehoused or bullet amounts remain due at the maturity of the mortgage term.  Therefore, it is important the arrangement is reviewed regularly to see how that amount may be reduced over time to the benefit of the borrower.  After this year&rsquo;s transactions, the bank has further work to do to lower the Bank&rsquo;s NPL ratio.  That said, we will continue to build on the work already done by the bank in moving customers from non-performing to performing status with a focus on, amongst a number of initiatives, natural cures and mortgage-to-rent.  <\/p><p> This transaction is very significant for the bank and, given the challenge we face to tackle NPLs, I believe it is as good a solution for customers as we could deliver.  It has much to commend it.  It allows Permanent TSB to reduce significantly its NPL ratio.  It creates a vehicle which attracts long-term, stable investors.  It locks in the restructuring agreements already agreed between the borrowers and Permanent TSB.  It brings on board a highly reputable and regulated servicer in Pepper.  <\/p><p> That concludes my remarks.  I will hand over to Mr. Ryan of Pepper Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544104800,"counter":1813,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation.  I am pleased to be here today.  I am here in my capacity as CEO of Pepper Finance Corporation Ireland.  I have held this role since I joined the company in October 2017.  I am accompanied here today by Mr. Dermot Caden, finance director, who will assist me in answering the committee's questions.  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this session to discuss the securitisation transaction, Project Glenbeigh, announced by PTSB on Thursday, 29 November.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to give an introduction to Pepper and to outline our planned approach to managing the more than 6,000 borrower relationships on behalf of Glenbeigh Securities once the customers transfer to Pepper from PTSB in the next six months.  I will provide members of the committee with as much information, insight and reassurance as possible when it comes to this transaction and our management of these customer relationships into the future.<\/p> <p>  I will take this opportunity to give the committee brief background information on Pepper and our strong track record in Ireland.  The Pepper Group is an international financial services business specialising in loan servicing, lending and advisory services.  In Ireland, our main business is loan servicing.  We entered the Irish market in 2012.  With our original 100 employees, from the outset we sought to position Pepper as a leading loan-servicing firm, providing a new and important service to banks and investors in Ireland by leveraging our significant track record and experience globally in onboarding and managing loan portfolios.  In particular, we are specialists in helping people experiencing financial difficulties manage their situation and get back on track through a sustainable solution suited to their individual circumstances.  When we entered the market in 2012, viable solutions for customers were in short supply.  We have focused on delivering a wide range of new strategies and initiatives to assist customers in the Irish market.  This has, for example, included split mortgages and mortgage-to-rent.  Pepper has completed more mortgage-to-rent arrangements than any other firm in the Irish market.  Pepper is a regulated financial services provider, regulated and authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland under the Central Bank Act 1997, as a retail credit firm.  Pepper is authorised to provide credit in Ireland and is deemed a credit-servicing firm authorised to provide credit servicing under the 1997 Act.  Pepper Ireland services over 64,000 loans in Ireland across all asset classes, valued at approximately &euro;16 billion at the end of 2017.  Following the Glenbeigh transaction, we expect to be servicing approximately &euro;10 billion of residential mortgage loans for customers.  Over 80% of these residential mortgage loans are fully performing.  <\/p> <p>  We employ approximately 380 people in Ireland.  The majority of our employees operate from our Shannon office in County Clare and we also have an office in Dublin.  Our customer-facing teams are made up of highly experienced people with specialised expertise operating in full compliance with the regulatory codes.  This is one of the reasons why banks, investment funds and long-term investors, such as the PTSB and Glenbeigh Securities, entrust their customer relationships to Pepper.  The growing number of long-term, performing and re-performing loans under our management is consistent with our long-term commitment to Ireland.  Our strategy and plan is to continue growing and developing our business here and become an ever more important part of the financial services fabric in Ireland.  Our commitment to the ongoing growth of the business forms part of a wider European strategy to grow our loan servicing business across Europe.<\/p><p>Ultimately our long-term growth ambition for the Irish business is to export our services into the European loan servicing market as that market develops. <\/p><p> I will talk about our approach to customers.  Our team mission at Pepper is to help people succeed.  Finding solutions for customers is part of the Pepper DNA.  Like many financial services companies, we are not perfect but we are working hard every day to improve how we service customers and find solutions for them.  From a personal perspective, I have looked to reinforce this focus on customers in Pepper Ireland by setting as one of the five strategic priorities treating customers fairly and achieving a positive customer experience in the Irish business.  In 2018, we set up a dedicated customer experience programme to improve the skills of our customer-facing staff working with customers in all situations day in, day out.  This includes quality assurance and complaint handling to ensure ongoing review and continuous improvement.  Every single member of our staff, regardless of level or team, has treating customers fairly built into his or her performance objectives.  We are proud of our people and their strong track record in managing loan books and servicing customers.  We recognise every customer situation is unique and each case needs to be treated on its own merits.  For customers in arrears, we use our experience and range of alternative repayment arrangement, ARA, solutions to work with these customers constructively and sympathetically to put in place, where possible, sustainable solutions that are tailored to their individual circumstances and situations. <\/p><p> Having described the benefit of that background to Pepper, our expertise and our approach to customers, I will turn to the Glenbeigh portfolio and how we plan to engage with these customers.  I appreciate this is a matter of significant interest to members of the committee and the customers included in the Glenbeigh portfolio.  I would like to repeat and expand on the assurances that I have previously provided to the Permanent TSB board and to the Central Bank leading up to this transaction and to provide five key assurances from Pepper to customers in the Glenbeigh portfolio.  All the customers transferring to Pepper in the next six months as part of Glenbeigh will be fully covered by the protections of the Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection codes and regulations as they were before, namely, the consumer protection code, CPC,  and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and SME codes as applicable.  Pepper is legally obliged to adhere to and will honour the existing terms of any previously agreed restructure if the customer is meeting all the terms of the restructuring arrangements.  If the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances do not change and the customer engages in a review process, there is a legal obligation upon us to continue to comply with the terms of the existing restructure arrangements, and we will do so.  Following a change in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances, any change to the restructure will reflect the relevant improvements or disimprovements in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.  Where a borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have disimproved or disimprove in the future, we will work with that customer constructively to find, where possible, a long-term, sustainable solution to his or her individual situation that is in his or her best interests as laid down in the codes.  Every case is different and we are known for taking an individual and personal approach to working with customers, based on a deep understanding of their circumstances. <\/p><p> Being a regulated entity in Ireland, Pepper takes its responsibilities and reputation here extremely seriously.  We apply the highest standards of corporate governance across our business and we work extremely hard to ensure we comply with our regulatory obligations and meet our legal and contractual commitments.  In looking at how we plan to engage with customers in the Glenbeigh portfolio, I note that this portfolio is made up of customers who are currently meeting the terms of their restructuring arrangements, which have been previously agreed between the customers and Permanent TSB.  The customers have been engaging and have a proven track record of meeting the terms of their restructuring agreements.  As Mr. Masding has noted, the relevant accounts generate a steady stream of cashflows.  These are attractive to long-term investors and Glenbeigh, the securitisation vehicle, is presenting itself as a long-term investment vehicle.<\/p><p> Taking this into account and in addition to the assurances I have provided, I will make the following final points on how Pepper plans to manage the portfolio to treat customers fairly, especially during the process of scheduled reviews of any restructuring arrangements.  Some of these points will echo what Mr. Masding has already said.  As master servicer, Pepper has the full power, authority and right to do all things that it reasonably considers necessary within applicable laws and regulations to manage the portfolio.  The Glenbeigh vehicle itself has effectively legally delegated these decision-making rights to Pepper as the Irish-regulated entity.  A review mechanism is commonplace in all restructuring agreements, as it is in the Glenbeigh portfolio.  If the loans had remained with Permanent TSB, it would have reviewed with the same objectives as Pepper will in the future.  Over 80% of the restructuring arrangements in place - I note that 50% are over 20 years - in the Glenbeigh portfolio have an average of ten or more years to run and all involve the agreed suspension of repayments on a significant amount of the money borrowed by the customer.  These warehoused amounts remain due at the maturity of the mortgage term.  It is important and in the customers' best interests that the arrangement is reviewed regularly with Pepper as the master servicer in the future to see how that amount may be reduced over time to the long-term benefit of the borrower. <\/p><p> I am here to assure customers transferring to Pepper of our positive track record and standing as a regulated entity in Ireland and to set out again the five assurances we have provided.  It is our hope over the long term that customers transferring to us will come to view their engagement with us as a positive experience and that we have treated them in a fair and transparent way.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for their invitation and would be happy to answer their questions on the Glenbeigh transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":1815,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ryan.

It has been a great source of frustration for Members of the Oireachtas that there has been little or no accountability in respect of so-called investment funds and how they treat mortgage owners.  This is a key question in terms of the transfer Permanent TSB is undertaking.  I want to start with the case of a constituent with whom I have been dealing for quite a number of years in respect of her Permanent TSB mortgage.  I have been on to Permanent TSB numerous times over the years about this mortgage.  It is a rather sad case.  It is a family with three children.  One of the children has a severe disability involving autism, dyspraxia and severe anxiety disorder.  While both parents work in the public service, one of them has been subject to severe health issues arising from the stress of the mortgage.  There is a restructured loan agreement currently in place.  She has adhered to all the elements of the agreement and on a couple of occasions has exceeded them in order to try to clear it if possible.  Permanent TSB has miscalculated her arrears.  She has been with Abhaile and MABS, which have given her advice around the miscalculations, but she has never been able to get satisfaction on that.  Most appallingly, which was the point at which I became involved as a Minister, Permanent TSB sought to include the child's domiciliary care allowance in the calculation of the payments the family would make.  As Minister, I got the banks generally to stand back from that kind of draconian action towards families with disabled children.  It was a particular low point.  The day before yesterday, the family received a letter from Pepper, like the other 6,000 families, advising that Pepper was purchasing its loan from Permanent TSB.  Clearly, the family is in enormous distress.  Their son with a disability is now 13 years old.<\/p><p>He suffers constantly from anxiety and this has an impact within the family.  The mother is frankly frightened about how Pepper will handle this.  Permanent TSB has made a very succinct presentation but a lot of questions about the management underlie it.  We all have concerns about how split mortgages will be dealt with by investment funds.  While I understand that Permanent TSB is a financial corporation, this is oriented towards an investment fund model, notwithstanding indications given previously by the Minister for Finance.  I have the family's consent to speak with Permanent TSB and Pepper about the split mortgage.<\/p><p> When Pepper bought Permanent TSB's split mortgages, was the total amount of the warehoused sections of the loans discounted from the price of the loans sold?  We have some summary figures, but it is not clear how the warehoused elements of the split mortgages were valued and whether they were discounted.  Either organisation or both might be in a position to answer that.  It is a key question.  In respect of the warehoused sections of mortgages, is Pepper seeking to write these off or to recover them in full?  I assume, on the basis of its presentation, that it is going to seek to recover them in full and will not write them off, even though it may have got those sections of the loans at a heavily discounted value.  Perhaps a discount of even 100% applied; I do not know.  As with the loans of many of the families involved, this family's loan is one in respect of which an agreement was reached.  Other members of the committee have correspondence from people who are meeting their terms and conditions but whose mortgages are being sold over their heads.  The key question is when and how often does Pepper propose to review the mortgages?  Will reviews include reverting to the warehoused elements of the split loans and charging in full for that.  We need to know how Pepper is going to treat this because that is what is going to keep a lot of people awake at night.  Pepper referred to a relatively short period of ten years regarding work-outs and so on.  It could provide a bit more information on that.<\/p><p> On the investors benefiting from the securitisation income stream, we have a note suggesting that the portfolio is generating cash equivalent to more than 3% of the asset security.  Will the investor benefiting from the securitisation income stream have any role in the management of the loan portfolio or is that entirely a matter for Pepper?  Will Permanent TSB indicate whether this is a final sale from the bank's point of view once the six-month period is concluded?  Thereafter, will it have washed its hands of this or will it remain as an investor in the investment fund and as a potential beneficiary of the securitisation stream of income as it arises?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#C00600","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544104800,"counter":1821,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked three questions which relate directly to Permanent TSB.

The first relates to the price paid.  The nominal value of the loans included in the portfolio is &euro;1.3 billion and the price paid is in the region of &euro;900 million, which represents a discount in the portfolio.  The portfolio is made up primarily of two types of long-term arrangement, namely, split exposures and part-capital and interest exposures.  There is no separate price for either.  It was one price for the entire portfolio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":1823,"content":"<p>It is a bundle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#D00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544104800,"counter":1824,"content":"<p>Yes, it is a bundle from that perspective.  Naturally, there are over 6,000 customer relationships there which have different perspectives regarding the level of bullet repayment, the interest rate attaching and whether they are on variable rates or tracker rates.  There is a very mixed bag within that but there are two types of arrangements.  The reference to the warehouse is not attainable.  The key thing is that the nominal value is &euro;1.3 billion and the price paid was in the region of &euro;900 million.  As to Permanent TSB's ongoing involvement, the transaction closed on Thursday and within six months the full servicing of the portfolio will switch to Pepper.  In the first six months, Permanent TSB will continue to deal with customer calls and interactions.  We will do that as a sub-servicer, which means that Pepper is the master servicer.  We will sub-service for the first six months and legal title to the mortgages will actually transfer at that period also.  Our interaction with the customer regarding these mortgage exposures will cease at that moment and Pepper will become the prime and absolute party for communication for the customer.  We have other relationships with these customers in that they have current accounts and things of that nature with other products.  That relationship will continue but interaction regarding these mortgages will cease.<\/p> <p>  The second part of that question relates to our interest in the portfolio.  We retain a 5% interest in the securitisation vehicle and that interest is across the different notes.  It is what is called a \"vertical slice\" or \"V note\".  This is a legal requirement which was implemented post-crisis whereby the originator of a portfolio must retain some interest in it.  We are following regulations in that regard.  We will continue to hold 5% of the portfolio.  They are the two key parts of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":1825,"content":"<p>What is Permanent TSB's anticipated return on that holding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#D00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544104800,"counter":1826,"content":"<p>We do not know.

As with the Permanent TSB representatives I will get the details afterwards to ensure that when this customer comes across to the management of Pepper the customer is flagged as a vulnerable customer and follows the specific policies we have for the customers in those types of situations.<\/p> <p>  I wish to clarify exactly what our role is in the transaction.  The sale of the Glenbeigh portfolio has effectively been a sale from Permanent TSB and a purchase by Glenbeigh Securities, which is the securitisation transaction.  This means the ownership is now split.  The beneficial ownership of the loans - who owns the economic interest - sits with Glenbeigh, and the legal title holder sits with Pepper.  We have two roles.  One as the legal title holder, which means we are the lender of record, and the second role is as the servicer to manage and administrate the loans day to day.  As regards who bought the loans, we did not actually buy the loans.  Glenbeigh Securities bought the loans and then passed the legal title to us.  It has appointed us as the servicer on the portfolio.<\/p> <p>  On how the warehouse debt will be treated, the Deputy's summary is correct that the warehouse debt is part of the transaction.  Glenbeigh Securities is taking on those loans in respect of the economic ownership.  That &euro;1.3 billion will move across and ultimately will be owned by the bondholders at the back.  I would like to clarify that the prospectus refers to eligible debt forgiveness.  I want to be very careful in what I say and calibrate my comments correctly; in very exceptional cases there will be a mechanism in certain cases such as vulnerable customers and in other cases of insolvencies when we do reviews.  There is a mechanism in place for that, but it will depend on each of the individual circumstances.  The main answer to Deputy Burton's question on what happens to the warehouse debt is that it moves across.  As I said at the beginning, some 86% of the loans mature in plus ten years and more than 50% do not mature until 20 years.  As the loans currently stand there is a bullet payment due at the end and this is the way the loans have been transferred across.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was about who would actually do the reviews and how would they be carried out.  As I said in my opening statement, the arrangements, if there is no change, absolutely stay in place.  No different from the Permanent TSB it is appropriate, and in many cases it is in the best interests of the customer, to have regular reviews.  The current protocol within Permanent TSB is that these have been done up to tri-annually.  This does not mean every three years, it means that sometimes it is every three years.  We will look at the frequency of that but I can say there is absolutely no plan to conduct reviews at an inappropriate frequency.  Some reviews will continue on a three year basis, some may move to two years and others may move to one year.  I can give an additional assurance today that there is absolutely no plan to review any arrangement more than once a year, unless the borrower comes to us.  How the reviews are carried out and how they are notified to the borrowers, are strictly governed and controlled by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The reviews must be at appropriate intervals and we must give a month's notice.  We will absolutely abide by that in carrying out the reviews.  I would also add that when we do the reviews, and as I said in my opening statement with regard to the code, we will carry those out constructively and sympathetically.  If nothing has changed and if everything is the exact same way, the arrangement stays in place and we move on to schedule the next review.<\/p> <p>  The last question was on control.  I will again explain the structure.  Permmanent TSB has sold the loans to Glenbeigh Securities with regard to the economic interest.  We are the legal title holder and the servicer.  The way this legal transaction has been set up, as I said in my opening statement, we have been put in full control to manage and administer the portfolio on a day to day basis, and effectively Glenbeigh has delegated that legal authority to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":1840,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses today.   I put it to Mr. Masding that over the past 24 hours as these letters have landed in letter boxes we have all been contacted by a number of the affected customers.  They do not have the opportunity we have but it is important to convey to Mr. Masding that some of them feel very betrayed and very angry.  They are worried.  They have these feelings because they co-operated with Permanent TSB.  These are good customers who engaged.  They faced up to their financial challenges and entered into restructuring agreements.  They are honouring those agreements in full so they had an expectation that Permanent TSB would stay the course with them and that the loans were, essentially, good loans or loans that were well on the way to being cured.  It is important to convey that to the witness.  We are receiving a lot of contact and emails.  It is important that people receive the reassurance they are being given, which is really what the substance and the core of this session should be about, to try to tease out exactly what this means for customers.<\/p> <p> I shall come back to Mr. Ryan on the question asked by Deputy Burton.

Our main role is as a servicer in this portfolio.  We are regulated in Ireland.  Every single interaction we have with a customer is covered by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, code and the consumer protection code, CPC.

The vehicle will continue to hold the loans even if the bondholders change in the background, as we have established already.  There is probably a double or triple lock to protect the consumers behind this.  In simple terms, the assets that underpin Glenbeigh are the 6,000 borrower relationships, equating to approximately 4,000 split loans and 2,000 part-capital and part-interest loans.  Those are the assets underpinning Glenbeigh .  Looking at this from a consumer perspective, which is important to do, regardless of who owns the loans, who the bondholders are and what vehicle owns them, the contract, original facility agreements and any future alternative repayment arrangement carrying the full weight of law, are protected.  Those contracts cannot be unwound.  They persist.  There are, as the Senator stated, some carve-outs if there are material changes, but the actual contractual rights can be enforced in law.  That is one protection that, regardless of ownership, sits with and protects the underlying customer.<\/p> <p>  All of these mortgages, whether split mortgages or part capital part interest mortgages, have been restructured.  They are alternative repayment arrangements, ARAs, so while they are performing against their new terms, strictly speaking, under the regulatory code, they still fall under the protections of code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA.  Ultimately, everything around CCMA, including how we conduct reviews, contact customers, run reviews, come to alternative arrangements and how we conclude that nothing has changed and that they should stay the same, is strictly governed by consumer protection code, CPC, and CCMA and will be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland on those.  There is very little wriggle room in terms of what can happen.  The only thing that can really change things is a change in the circumstances of the individual customer.<\/p> <p>  The third protection to bear in mind is that if the mortgage moves to another loan owner, by law in Ireland, the loan owner or unregulated owner must have a regulated entity in Ireland to service their loans.  It is not legal for a loan owner not to have a regulated entity, be it Pepper or another company, servicing those loans.  The regulated entity must follow all the rules of the CCMA, CPC, SME and all the other codes as applicable.<\/p> <p>  I hope I have answered the questions regarding ownership.  In the context of the vehicle, the question is what is in place to protect the consumers.  The contracts will persist, the ARAs and other protections of the CCMA will persist, and ultimately, if the loan moves around, a loan owner has to appoint a company such as Pepper or another regulated loan owner which is overseen by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#H03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":1977,"content":"<p>The biggest concern is that there is a perception among the public that many of the funding vehicles are themselves borrowing in the short-term.

The Deputy challenged me, quite correctly, on those customers who I said in my opening remarks had engaged with us and feel let down by Permanent TSB.  I empathise with why the Deputy made that statement.  The bank has a 6% non-performing loan ratio, split mortgages and part-capital and part-interest mortgages with bullet repayments, which are non-performing loans as defined by the rules.<\/p><p>As I assured the committee at my previous appearance, we were looking at all the alternatives to reduce the non-performing ratio and this was in our opinion the least worst alternative.  Why?  It was because we found investors who matched the duration of the mortgages, the long-term treatments transfer in full to the vehicle and their protections are maintained and, to the best of our ability, we find a servicer of that vehicle which is experienced in the Irish market.<\/p><p> To sum up, Deputy Doherty's comments around the section 110 tax status in the prospectus are correct.  I want to bifurcate any perception that McKinsey might have that the bank took the 5% to take advantage of that which was not the case.  It has to take the 5% in order for the vehicle to be valid.  While we will have to agree to disagree, that is the bank's perspective on why this transaction happened in order to reduce its non-performing ratio to a level that makes it an institution that can compete into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#J02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":2001,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Masding for answering that it will be tax free.

Pepper is an agent.  It is clear from the prospectus that this can be sold at any time.  Indeed, Pepper can be removed as the agent at any time by this vehicle.  We have no idea who owns the vehicle.  The big concern here relates to certainty.  Regardless of people's opinions of high-street banks, they know that they want to be here in 30, 40 or 50 years.  Permanent TSB structured its split mortgages in a way that meant up to 80% of each mortgage was warehoused.  Pepper is saying that unless things change, it will continue to honour those split mortgages all the way through.  What does the word \"change\" mean in this context?  Does it mean that if somebody's wages increase by 2% or 3% in accordance with inflation - this is subject to legal test - Pepper will be allowed to have a review?  The reality is that nobody has trust in Pepper.  People definitely do not have trust in the vehicle that owns their loans now.  That vehicle did not exist 30 days ago.  This point relates to Bank of New York Mellon and Wilmington.  This is a shelf company.  It shares its registered address with another 126 businesses in a building down the road.  There is no face to this.  Pepper has come in here after a long challenge for us to try to get it to come in.  The people who own these loans are faceless.  We have no idea.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about the review.  What does the guarantee mean in terms of change?  Obviously, people's circumstances will change.  We hope they will change for the better.  Nobody is going to stay in exactly the same position.  What guarantee is being given to people?  When Mr. Ryan states that there is a legal guarantee, can he specify where that actually exists?  Can he outline where in the prospectus the issue of the operating committee to which he has spoken, as he said in response to Deputy Michael McGrath, is dealt with?  Perhaps he can dig out a page reference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#L01300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544104800,"counter":2051,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  The review period is talking about the restructuring arrangements.  As I stated at the outset, the majority of the mortgages - approximately 4,000 - are split.  Approximately 2,000 are in part-capital and part-interest arrangements.  The review arrangements are a standard part of the terms and conditions.  Reviews were going on with Permanent TSB.  They are a standard part of any restructuring arrangement.  I have already addressed the point that was made in respect of frequency.  We will look at a range of factors, like we do in any alternative restructuring arrangement.  The first thing I will say is that every single case, in reality with our consumers and under the CCMA, is unique.  No two cases are the same.  The first factor we take into account under the CCMA is the overall indebtedness of the customer, which may have changed in the case of somebody who has not been reviewed for a number of years.  The second factor we take into account is the person's financial situation - whether there are two people working in the family, whether there is an additional person working in the family or whether somebody might have got a new job.  The third factor we take into account is the person's personal circumstances - whether he or she has dependants or whether there are other things that are straining on their income.<\/p> <p>  When we have formed the overall picture, we take a view.  Basically, there are three outcomes that can happen.  We run it through our affordability assessment, which basically says what a customer can or cannot afford.  The first of the three outcomes is when it is found, after everything has been considered together, that nothing has really changed.  It has been mentioned that we are in a much better economy now than we were in five or ten years ago, thankfully.  The customer may be in the exact same circumstance.  If he is in the exact same circumstance, it is a fairly short conversation.  We will say to the customer that he should stay in this arrangement and nothing should change.  I want to talk about this in real terms rather than in the abstract.  If the customer has received a promotion and is earning more money, or if additional money which is attributable to the property is coming into the family because the customer's partner is starting to work, we work with the customer to say that there is some additional affordability.  We look at the customer's level of affordability under the previous circumstance and point out that there is now increased affordability.<\/p> <p>  This links into our obligation to be open, fair and transparent and to have the customer's best interests at heart.  For example, we might remind the customer that a big bullet payment is due at the end because of the way these mortgages are structured.  I did not structure them that way; it is how they are structured.  We might suggest to the customer that because he is due to pay a certain amount in ten, 15 or 20 years, the right thing to do in his best interests is to increase his monthly repayment slightly.  Over 20 years, that could make a difference between the customer having &euro;50,000 due at the end of his mortgage and having &euro;10,000 due at the end of his mortgage.  Those are rough numbers, but the difference could be something like that.  We might say to the customer that we think his arrangement should stay in place, with a slight tweak being made to it because that is in his best interests.  This is one example of how things might change.<\/p> <p>  I would like to speak about our obligations.  Most of my team of specialists have been doing this work for seven or ten years.  We have to be able to stand over these arrangements.  Quality assurance is done by internal teams that look at all the documentation to ascertain whether we documented the numbers correctly and explained these matters to the customer correctly and whether the customer understood what was happening.  Any change in every single one of these arrangements is absolutely subject to review by the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#L01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":2052,"content":"<p>Will the assessment of income be the exact same as that done by Permanent TSB?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#L01500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544104800,"counter":2053,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#L01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":2054,"content":"<p>Exactly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#L01700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544104800,"counter":2055,"content":"<p>Sorry, it will be as governed by the CCMA.

By the originator, that is the bank that originally provided the loan.  Permanent TSB was also the bank that was in charge of the loan and it should be acknowledged in this forum that all of these customers did go through a period of distress given that they went through an arrangement.  While the loans are performing now we are extremely aware that these customers have had issues in the past.  Thankfully they are now in an arrangement and are all paying.  I just wanted to make sure that we are clear and that we acknowledge that.  The loans would be in the warehouse treatment, which obviously is quite a big folio, and the first decision we will need to look at is the review periods of the alternative repayment arrangements.  The Senator made a very good point; the review periods may change in the future.  It is not a lock-down term in the contracts.  I have been quite open and I have given five assurances.  We need to be quite open - I believe in being genuine with customers - and the frequency of the review periods has been a product of the number of people who have been assigned to this.  Earlier I had said - verbally as it was not included in my submission - that I do not see any customer being reviewed more than annually unless in exceptional circumstances.  There is not a specific number in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  It does refer to appropriate frequency and we will absolutely consider that as to what is appropriate.  Again, we would consider when the last review was held.  That would be a reasonable way for us to consider when to do the actual review.    I also echo Mr. Masding's comments that while those reviews need to be done in a considerate, sympathetic and constructive way a review is not only in the interests of the servicer and the ultimate beneficial owner.  In many cases it might actually be the in the interests of the mortgage holder.  I have given a few hypothetical examples.  There may be a situation where a mortgage holder has not been reviewed in a couple of years and unfortunately his or her circumstances have not improved.  The mortgage holder may be in a worse position than two or three years ago.

That is one of the key decision rules we apply.  In this particular case we have not burnt any capital.  We have actually got a small capital release, which is a great outcome for the Irish taxpayer.  Our judgment was that we would have burnt taxpayers' capital in the other two alternatives and that capital is not mine to burn.

I am very aware that some Glenbeigh customers will be listening to this or reading it and I want to ensure the numbers I provide are taken in context.  As such, of 730,000 mortgages in Ireland, 1,500 homes were repossessed.  Obviously, we would all prefer if that were a smaller number.  The orders for possession Pepper took in 2017 were 51 and the actual orders for repossession that were executed was 18 out of a total number in Ireland of approximately 1,500.  Every one of those is a last resort.  One of the reasons we keep that number as low as possible is that we work extremely hard on mortgage to rent.  We are advocates of mortgage to rent, which is an extremely important solution to keep people in their homes.  It has some requirements and not everyone can qualify for it.  The last number I give relates to those cases where we have exhausted all possibilities.  Typically, these cases take five years.  We have five years working with these customers to find alternative solutions.  Of those cases, approximately 75% have been classified as \"non-engaging\" at some point in time.  We will work all the way up to the steps of the courthouse for the very small number of cases that go to court.  At least half the cases that get to that point, however, involve customers who are not engaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1544104800,"counter":2260,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Ryan give us some numbers around all of those?

I am just asking.  I note the type of information to which Deputy Michael McGrath referred earlier which comes to committee members.  People tell us that from 2012 or 2013 onwards, it has been extremely difficult to get in touch with Pepper.  Others say Pepper has never engaged with them.  We are told receivers are appointed and there is then no engagement with them.  Receivers collect the rent but there is no evidence it is paid against the original debt.  In some cases, individuals say they have lost their businesses over very small debts with no recourse to Pepper, which simply refused to engage.  In one instance involving Sheldon, which is another company Pepper manages, it was then discovered that Mars Capital were in it as well.  My point is that there are examples where customers have attempted to engage with Pepper and found themselves apparently associated with one vulture fund and another.  A receiver is thrown into the mix and, in spite of the best efforts of the person who had the loan originally, no solution is proposed.  It gives the impression that the individual has no chance against Pepper.  People feel bullied and harassed in their engagement with Pepper.  I am only reading from examples of emails I have received and I have been asked to put that to Mr. Ryan today.  There are real cases behind those allegations.  As Deputy Pearse Doherty set out, it moves on to no signatures on transactions and no approval from the person who had the loan.  Obviously, Pepper is working on the fine print and being enabled to pass on the loans.  As a result, the customer does not know where he or she stands.  With those cases coming to light because of today's hearing, what is Mr. Ryan's response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018120600002#R01100","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544104800,"counter":2267,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for sharing some of those.  First, we are here talking about Glenbeigh and the securitisation.  The reason I bring that up is that from a CCMA point of view, there are very strict rules about engagement and how we deal with customers.  The whole area of receivers and the processes that apply to buy-to-let and commercial real estate are quite different.  Because of CCMA, how that part of the business is managed is much tighter from a regulatory code point of view.  It is absolutely not my position to make any excuses.  We are not perfect.  There should not be cases where it is difficult for third parties such as receivers or for customers to engage with Pepper.  It is difficult for me to comment on individual cases, but I note that some of these cases are quite difficult.  People are in very difficult circumstances.

The reason I raise it here is that Mr. Ryan says how good and customer-focused Pepper is.  He referred to Pepper's desire first and foremost to keep people in their homes.  That is its goal.  However, the experience of those who have contacted the committee has been that there were no negotiations.  On the business side, it has been a matter of no negotiations and the appointment of a receiver.  There was no discussion.  That is what they are telling us.  As I say, the debts involved seem to be small.  In one letter, we were asked whether Pepper had an office in Ireland as the person had not been able to engage with it.  I am putting this to Mr. Ryan for clarity because he is telling us the opposite.  He says Pepper's door is open and people can contact it.  He says Pepper engages and protects people's rights legally but that does not appear to have been the case with a lot of people who have written to us.

Each time we do a review, we will determine if anything has changed.<\/p> <p>  Let us take the example of someone whose mortgage is due in 20 years.  As we said at the beginning and a number of times today, it is in most people's best interest to have a plan for what happens at the end.  When one is looking at restructuring arrangements, time is a critical factor.  It is not the same for all customers but, thankfully for the majority, there is time.  We would look to engage with them in the first review and see if there is any additional affordability.  We can look at all of the various alternative restructuring arrangements in terms of recapitalisation, term extensions and so on and all of those options are available.  The main piece, however, is whether there is an ability to pay more, whether the affordability has changed or the customer's circumstances have changed.  The easiest way for customers to address it, if it is affordable, sustainable and in their best interests, is to pay more off each month.  That is the most basic arrangement and that can happen if the circumstances change.  If they do not change, then that is off the table and we continue on as we are and look at it again the next year or in two years.  That is effectively how we will approach it.

I stand to be corrected, but my understanding is that well over 95% of them - perhaps 98% - are performing to their new arrangements.  They already have a treatment.  A team has already engaged with them in an effort to find a solution to the situation they are in.  While they are now back in an affordable position, and hopefully some of the distress of the situation they have been in has been taken away, the issue is that a lump sum is due to be paid at the end.  For 86% of them, that will be ten years or more into the future.  We will engage with all those customers when we have review periods.  We work with them sympathetically, constructively and positively.  We work through all our different arrangements to see if there is something that works for the borrower and is realistic.

This is not just about Permanent TSB.  We need to ensure we can withstand future economic shocks.  The regulator has said we need to have detailed and credible plans.  As I said at my previous appearance before this committee, there has been no specific instruction on how we should do this.  There is a very clear view that we need to have realistic and ambitious plans.  I have spoken previously about how such a plan can be delivered.  I hope I have explained to the committee this afternoon that my first duty is to the taxpayer.  We have delivered a plan in a way that minimises any capital destruction.  Obviously, this has other elements.  It is not just about having a hard financial governing objective.  There are also supplementary tests.

I often consider that we are here to remind them of what customers are saying and to attempt to get better outcomes for them.

That is why I asked delegates at the beginning of the meeting about coming here again at some stage.  It is not to ambush them but to get at what is really happening.  If some of what we are being told is not correct, they will have an opportunity to correct the record.  People are anxious to get on with their lives.  I understand the angst on the delegates' side, but there is also a pressing issue on the side of their customers.  I thank them for coming and their colleagues.

There were also balances payable to former civil servants who retired in 2009 under the incentivised scheme for early retirement.<\/p> <p>  Pensions and lump sums paid under the pension schemes for established civil servants make up just under 90% of the total gross expenditure on the superannuation and retired allowances Vote.  The main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire in the year.  It is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next for a number of reasons.  These include that the majority of established civil servants may choose to retire within a five year window between the ages of 60 and 65.  In addition, a number of people aged under 60 retire each year under the cost neutral early retirement scheme or on the grounds of ill-health.  Each year, a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement.  The average pension benefits lump sum and pension that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year will depend on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;569.9 million, based on a forecast of 1,585 retirements from the established scheme.  As a general rule, for each person who retires the once-off lump sum paid out is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  Subhead A4 is, therefore, a key driver of the expenditure variants on the Vote in any given year.  To the end of October, &euro;88.5 million was expended from subhead A4 compared to the original 2018 full year estimate of &euro;94.2 million.  It is now estimated the gross expenditure of the Vote for 2018 will be in the region of &euro;584.9 million, &euro;15 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;569.9 million as voted previously by the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The committee should also note that the level of gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated by anticipated levels of appropriations-in-aid.<\/p><p>The figure for appropriations-in-aid for 2018 was estimated at &euro;203.8 million.  To end October, receipts of &euro;191.8 million have been received and with receipts with regard to the single public service pension scheme ahead of profile year to date total appropriations are now projected at &euro;218.8 million by year end, which is &euro;15 million more than expected.  I am seeking the committee's approval for the use of this excess to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.  <\/p><p> I am satisfied that the appropriate Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 net will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of the civil servants expected to retire at the end of 2018.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#A00400","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2612,"content":"<p>I am happy with the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#B00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2613,"content":"<p>My apologies for being late.

I want to acknowledge the huge amount of work done by Senator Higgins and her efforts to improve the Bill.  I acknowledged on Second Stage that the Minister and his Department engaged with Senator Higgins and either accepted many of her amendments or came back with Government amendments to improve the Bill.  There are still a lot of issues with the Bill as passed by the Seanad and our amendments seek to address these issues.<br\/><br\/>Many of the Minister amendments today seem to seek to row back on the amendments he accepted in the Seanad.  The problems with the Bill that our amendments try to address mostly relate to how our Bill, particularly in section 7, interacts with the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005.  The Minister of State, when summing up on Second Stage, dismissed our arguments in relation to this Act but this Bill will, whether the Minister of State admits it or not, consolidates the State's prolonged attempt to coerce the citizens to agree to large scale processing of their data - the Government's attempt to finally provide a legal basis for this kind of data processing.  A number of times during the Seanad debate the Minister openly admitted that the Bill was an attempt to provide a legal basis for something that was already happening.  He openly admitted that the kind of large scale processing of personal data that the State has been engaged in for many years is, basically, still illegal.  The GDPR, however, will still make this type of coerced consent illegal even if the Government passes this Bill without our amendments and the State will still be open to considerable fines for violation of the GDPR.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the GDPR, EU Directive 95\/46 made coerced consent, illegal and the law around consent has been strengthened further with GDPR.  Article 4(11) of the GDPR clearly sets out one of the requirements of valid consent in that it must be &quot;freely given&quot;.  The Article 29 Working Party published guidelines on consent in November 2017 to guide people in relation to the consent requirements in GDPR.  It states: &quot;[A]s a general rule, the GDPR prescribes that if the data subject has no real choice, feels compelled to consent or will endure negative consequences if they do not consent, then consent will not be valid.&quot;  The data subject must, therefore, have control over his or her personal data and must not be coerced into consenting.  Withholding a pension payment from an elderly woman for 18 months because she refused to register for a public services card is clearly coerced consent and a form of State coercion.  Withholding basic State services from people because they object to the &quot;once-only&quot; principle and large scale, <i>ad hoc<\/i>data sharing, is coerced consent.<br\/><br\/>I hear many people say they have nothing to hide and they do not care who has access to their data, so why should we be worried about this.  We would argue they are missing the point.  The Minister and many others will say that the administration of public services needs to be efficient.  I totally agree with that.  However, there is a basic legal and human right to privacy, for example, in the EU Charter of Human Rights, and even if people do not really care about this right or say they have nothing to hide, it still exists.  We cannot be selective in how we respect and observe basic human rights.  The State should not act illegally, and we should not tolerate the State wilfully and openly acting illegally, even if we do not specifically put much pass on data privacy.  We should not tolerate State coercion, in any forms.<br\/><br\/>When explaining his decision to refuse Senator Higgins&rsquo;s same amendment in the Seanad, the Minister explained his decision by saying that he could not accept amendments that would be in direct conflict with provisions relating to the public services card set out in existing legislation, referring to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  However, amendments Nos. 4 and 7 are not in conflict with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.<br\/><br\/>This Bill interacts in a hugely significant way with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Section 247C of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, as amended, states that the Minister may require any person receiving a benefit to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity.  This, of course, is a completely reasonable requirement.  Section 247C(3) of the Act specifies the manner in which the Minister of State may be satisfied.  It essentially describes the Standard Authentication Framework Environment 2, SAFE 2, verification process for registering a person&rsquo;s identity.  The problem we have with what the State is trying to do here, however, is that the aim of the public services card and the SAFE 2 process is not just verification.  The aim is to coerce consent to data sharing and to enable the creation of a massive database of citizens&rsquo; data, otherwise known as the single customer view.<br\/><br\/>However, section 247C(3) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act does not state that the purpose of going through the verification process, or SAFE 2, is to have one's data entered into a national database or that one's data will be shared with 150 other public, specified bodies.  Section 247C(1) also makes it clear that the purpose of the verification process described is &quot;to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity&quot;.  Once the person&rsquo;s identity has been verified and once the Minister is satisfied as to the person&rsquo;s identity, there is absolutely no legal basis for any more processing of that person&rsquo;s data, unless one has obtained that person&rsquo;s consent.  This Bill is the Government&rsquo;s way to establish this legal basis. <br\/><br\/>The point of our amendments Nos. 4, 7 and 16 is provide a solution to this practice of coercing consent, so that a person does not have to register for a public services card or agree to the processing of their public service identity dataset to access basic services.  There has to be an alternative.<br\/><br\/>As I said, we do not have a problem with the SAFE 2 verification process <i>per se<\/i>.  Verification of identity is obviously essential.  However, the State has, with the public services card, created a bizarre situation where verification of identity leads inevitably to large scale sharing of personal data.  We either need to separate the two, verification of identity and large scale data processing, or we need to provide an alternative to the public services card as a processing of verification.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 5 proposes to use the definition of data sharing provided by Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates in their joint submission on the proposals for the Bill.  One of the bigger problems with the Bill, as initiated, was that it failed to distinguish whether the sharing to which it referred was a case by case exchange of data for a specific purpose, or the creation of large scale databases like the single customer view with no specific purpose.  The Minister introduced a Government amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad that I acknowledge went some way towards addressing the lack of specificity in terms of an understanding of what constitutes data sharing.  Section 19 of the Bill, which states what a data sharing agreement shall contain, now states that the agreement must specify whether the information being shared relates to individual data subjects or classes of data subjects, and whether the sharing will be on a once-off or an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#C01800","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2641,"content":"<p>We are dealing with amendments Nos. 4, 10, 11, 15 and 16.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#D00200","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2642,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 is as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#D00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2643,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 is separate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#D00400","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2644,"content":"<p>My apologies.

I better not keep the committee here all day.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 10 and 15 are essentially the same as an amendment submitted previously by Senator Higgins.  These amendments also try to address the problem of coerced consent.  It is vital that the Bill gives people a mechanism to opt out of the &quot;once-only&quot; principle and to indicate that it would be their preference to give each of the specified bodies their data separately and that they do not find it a burden to provide their data to specified bodies on a case by case basis.  In response to what was essentially the same amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad, the Minister provided three defences of the Government&rsquo;s position, and none of them was relevant to the problem Senator Higgins was trying to address.<\/p><p>Firstly, he referred to the right to object to the processing of one&rsquo;s data as specified in the GDPR.  The right to object is not a remedy for coerced consent.  If we do not provide the option for a person to opt out of <i>ad hoc<\/i>processing of his or her data, then that person will not be able to access public services or welfare services without first consenting to large scale reusing of his or her data.  The right to object in the GDPR is a right to object to already existing processing.  On the basis of this Bill, a person&rsquo;s consent would, by that point, already have been coerced.  The right to object as a process or mechanism to opt out of <i>ad hoc<\/i>processing or as a way to choose providing data to specified bodies would involve recourse to the courts system and the Data Protection Commission.<\/p><p>It is an odd suggestion from the Minister.  He wants citizens to have to go through an arduous and difficult court process to access their basic human rights.  In any case, the right to object would not even address the problem for coerced consent.  With all due respect, listening to the Seanad debates, I am not sure if there is a full understanding around the problems of coerced consent.  During that debate, the Minister said that when a person presents to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to apply for a social welfare payment that &quot;it could be inferred that there is consent already contained in that by virtue of the fact that they have presented themselves to look for that particular support or service from the State&rdquo;.<\/p><p>I mentioned this in my Second Stage speech and I mention it here again because it shows a fundamental failure to understand the nature of consent.  That is a worrying statement as far as we are concerned.  People apply for social welfare support because they are vulnerable and need help so it is strange that the Minister of State could extrapolate from that that at the same time these vulnerable people automatically consent to such widespread sharing of their data with approximately 150 other public bodies, via the single customer view database.  It is amazing that the Minister of State who has responsibility for the biggest data sharing project in the history of the State should reveal such a fundamental understanding of the nature of consent.<\/p><p> In refusing to accept Senator Alice-Mary Higgins's amendment on the data sharing agreements that the Bill makes necessary, the Minister of State referred to: \"A fairly protracted public consultation process that goes on well in advance of the agreements being set out.\"  The public consultation process that the Minister of State mentioned is of course welcome but it is irrelevant to those people, no matter how rare they are, who would want to provide their data on a case by case basis.  The public consultation process may permit the individuals in question some kind of input into the process on data sharing agreements and it may provide some welcome assurances on data processing but it would not address the specific problem of coerced consent.<\/p><p> The Minister of State rejected Senator Higgins's amendment on the basis that: \"We do not want to have a situation where every single individual would have to be contacted in advance of the data being used.\"  Maybe the Minister of State misunderstood the nature of Senator Higgins's amendment; if not we would see this as disingenuous.  There would be no reason whatsoever to contact every single individual in advance of the data being used.  Most people would prefer the once only principle and have no problem with their data being shared with all of the listed, specified bodies.  Clearly most people will see it as easier, handier and vastly more efficient to just have to provide their data once but when a person's data is first collected, which at that moment is via registration for a public services card, but a person must also then be able to opt out of further processing without their consent.  To make access to the State's services dependent on consent is a form of safe coercion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#D00700","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2648,"content":"<p>This is a data sharing and governance Bill.  Implicit in the Bill is a governance mechanism on the sharing of information which currently takes place without governance and the Deputy accepts that.  At the very start of this Bill, it is important to say that data sharing is currently taking place in this country legitimately, which people want to take place, including at the birth of a child for instance.  When a child is born, social welfare becomes aware of that child's existence and the parents can derive a social welfare payment from that.  Nobody would expect that we would try to undermine that, neither should anybody expect that we would undermine a situation where a person works in seven or eight different elements of the public sector, that information on their pension entitlements should not be collated and that consent is inferred.<\/p><p>I stand over what I said in the Seanad which has been accurately referred to here.  Public sector data sharing is taking place in this country for which there is no legal basis but which people want to continue because they want the services that derive from same.  In order to make sure that we get a legal basis for that, we want to put a legal floor underneath it.  In doing that, we have a data sharing governance board, which is referred to later on.  That will give a statutory entitlement for people who have an issue around consent.  When the data sharing agreements are being drawn up, and there will be many of them, they will have an entitlement to have their comments and referrals made.<\/p><p>On top of all of that, we continue to have the Data Protection Commissioner.  The data sharing and governance board will be obliged under this law, if enacted, to publish the agreements in advance and to make sure that they are properly constructed and will then make reference to the Minister.  What we are doing at the moment around the sharing of information for the development of public services is questionable and I acknowledge the Deputy's point on that.<\/p><p>We are signatories to the Tallinn Declaration and the once only principle and I recently met with a group of ordinary citizens recently.  They were randomly selected by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and everybody universally agreed that when they are deriving public services, they feel this obligatory necessity to constantly provide the same level of information.  In the once only principle, which is referred to as one of the bases for the construction of this Bill, we are giving people an opportunity, under a safe system, namely myGovID and others, through the public services card which the Deputy refers to, which is already in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, and the Deputy will know from the debate on this in the Seanad that this Bill does not impact in any way on the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, nor can it.<\/p><p>Many of the services that we want to actually make sure are done, are being done already but we want to create a safe, legal mechanism for these.  As I have said, one of those is the collation of pensions across the public sector.  Nobody would be disagreeable to that.  If a person moves from an education and training board to the Civil service and on to a semi-State company before working for a primary school, should he or she not have access to a system where all of their information can be shared?  There are likely to be thousands of agreements put in place, overseen by a board which is laid out in the Bill.  We have to ask ourselves if the current system is better or worse than having an independent governance board which will oversee the building, examination and implementation of all of those data sharing agreements which are currently taking place in a vacuum because there is no legal basis for it.<\/p><p>On consent, article 6 of the GDPR provides for consent as one of the lawful reasons for the processing of data.  Other reasons include compliance with existing legal obligations.  As well as that, in the Seanad we took on board Senator Higgins's suggestion on it being necessary and proportionate.  I have no problem in saying here that it was a very good suggestion and it has now been incorporated into the Bill.  The construct of what we are trying to do will be the thrust of these amendments.  Do we want a safe mechanism for the collation of data for public services or do we not?  It is currently taking place.  Do we want an independent governance board that will oversee it?  Do we want the public to have a right to have an involvement in the drawing up of agreements that will be put in place, have a public consultation and have those consultations published?<\/p><p>We do not have any of that at the moment.  We have an <i>ad hoc<\/i>system which is not legally sound.  A pensioner or a social welfare recipient such as the mother of a newborn child, should have access to the once only principle.  It is only right and fair that a person who deals with the Government of Ireland has access to the once only principle when he or she engages with the Government on services that are governed by an independent governance board, set out in an agreement that is put in place after protracted public consultation.  It is perfectly reasonable also that the Data Protection Commissioner will oversee the implementation of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#E00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2649,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with the option being there and it makes a lot of sense.

What is being proposed is that if someone opts into the once-only principle and submits his or her data, there is an implied consent that the data can be shared.

Deputy Wallace will correct me if I am wrong but it is my understanding that there would be an implied consent once a person opts into the once-only principle and there would also be an option available to opt out.  It is not the case that everybody will be walking around with bundles of paper under their arms for different bodies because once an individual gives his or her data, those data can be shared under the provisions of the Bill.

I, too, have legitimate concerns, particularly about the way data are being handled in the private sector.  There have been recent examples of problems in that area.  Deputy Wallace has done a lot of very positive work on the penalty points issue, for example.  Imagine a situation where a driver would not give his or her consent to have penalty points information shared between one arm of the State and another, namely, between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  No one would want this but we could have a situation whereby an individual does not consent to have his or her penalty points data shared between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, via a garda on the side of the road, and the driver licensing authority.  Under the amendment that Deputy Wallace has asked me to accept, we could have a ridiculous scenario where an individual does not give consent to or seeks to withdraw consent from one public body sharing information with another.  We could also have another ridiculous scenario in which a person who is not tax compliant does not give consent to the sharing of his or her data between agencies of the State.  Bodies such as the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well as other State bodies responsible for payments would not have access to that information.  This could also include the sheriff's office, the Companies Registration Office, CRO, and any other arm of the State that could be affected by financial fraud.

Amendment No. 5 proposes to use the definition of data sharing proposed by Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates in their joint submission on proposals for the Bill.  One of the bigger problems with the Bill as initiated was that it failed to clarify whether the sharing to which it referred was a case-by-case exchange of data for a specific purpose or the creation of large-scale databases like the single customer view with no specific purpose.<\/p><p>The Minister introduced a Government amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad that I acknowledge went some way towards addressing the lack of specificity around what constitutes data sharing.  Section 19, which states what a data-sharing agreement shall contain, now states that the agreement must specify whether the information being shared relates to individual data subjects or classes of data subjects, and whether the sharing will be on a once-off or an ongoing basis.  That is progress, even though these specifications or details might also be included in the definition of data sharing in section 9.  The changes or improvements to this part of the Bill were a result of another amendment submitted by Senator Higgins who, like ourselves, was relying on the Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates definition of data sharing.<\/p><p>In the Seanad the Minister said that a simple definition of data sharing is necessary without really explaining why simplicity in the definition is so important to him.  This amendment proposes to define data sharing as a process, not just as a set of actions.  The Bill's current definition is not very different from the original definition in the proposals for the Bill, which was just a circular statement essentially saying that data sharing is the sharing of data.  We are proposing a definition that suggests a system which might be subject to governance.  The definition of data sharing at the moment is broad to the extent that it will inevitably lead to further functional creep, as we have seen with the public services card and its expansion.<\/p><p>This is linked with amendment No. 6, is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#J00700","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2695,"content":"<p>Yes.

In their submission on the proposals for the Bill, Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates, based in Wexford, highlighted this problem, particularly the fact that without such a definition there may be variances or discrepancies between Departments and between public bodies.  These discrepancies may arise not only in how each body defines data governance but maybe more importantly on how the principles of data governance are applied.  Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates, groups with considerable expertise in this area, believe there should be a clear, centralised, standard definition of the term in the Bill.  We are offering the example they put forward in their joint submission as a possible definition.  The definition they have suggested defines governance as the system that determines who defines the processes and methods of data sharing, what data may be shared, how often, to whom, and under what legislatively supported circumstances.  They also make the point that governance must involve not only decision rights but also accountability to ensure the systems and processes under governance operate effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120600002#J00900","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1544090400,"counter":2697,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 seeks to change the definition of data sharing in section 9.

This is a standard provision given to most boards.  I would expect that the skill sets each member will bring to the board will be sufficient for it to carry out its functions internally most of the time.  However, I foresee circumstances where it would appropriate for the board to seek external advice and assistance on specific matters.  We discussed this during a previous debate on the Bill.  This particularly arises where the board is developing data management rules, procedures and standards and may need to draw on specialised, technical advice on certain matters.  Nobody would want a situation where we tie the hands of the board so it could not get external advice.

The English version of the title in section 6(1) is the National Shared Services Office; the definite article, &quot;the&quot;, is included.  In the Irish language version provided, Oifig N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Comhroinnte, the definite article was omitted.  There are two articles in use in the English language, the definite article, &quot;the&quot;, and the indefinite article, &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;.  As a result, omitting the definite article in English - this is like my leaving certificate modh coinn&iacute;olach - does not render the noun indefinite.  The use of the indefinite article serves for that purpose.  For this reason, the definite article is regularly omitted in titles in English as it allows for the use of a more concise title in signage, for example the &quot;Department of Education and Skills&quot; or the title head of section 6.  However, this is not possible in the Irish language as an omission of the definite article automatically renders a noun indefinite.  The article &quot;the&quot; is clearly intended and expressed in the English version of the title in section 6(1) but in the Irish-language title, the article &quot;an&quot; is omitted.  The purpose of the amendment is to correct this oversight.<\/p><p>An amendment is also required to the Long Title of the Bill to reflect that it provides an amendment to the National Shared Services Office Act 2017.  This is provided for in amendment No. 31, which also provides for the insertion of a reference to the amendment to the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 2011 in the Long Title of the Bill.  This relates to section 72 of the Bill, which provides for an amendment to section 17(a) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act to allow the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to collect and process public service information under Part 5 of this Bill.  This reference should have been included in the Long Title when the Bill was first published but was omitted due to an oversight.

Key issues for the committee are the targets for meeting social and affordable housing need under Rebuilding Ireland and the delivery of those units.  I have the same questions for each local authority on that.  Many members are concerned that the targets, in particular for what many of us call \"real social housing\", namely, units owned by local authorities or approved housing bodies, are far too low to meet the overall level of need in each of the witnesses' local authority areas.  What I mean by that is that if one takes the current net housing list and the HAP transfer list, it gives one the real social housing need in a local authority area.  If one matches that against the targets in Rebuilding Ireland, including builds, acquisitions and leasing, one third at best of the real social housing need will be met over the next three years.   While the Minister will reply \"Yes, but everyone's need will be met through HAP and RAS, etc.\", are local authorities concerned about the wide gap between additions to the real social housing stock and the level of need according to their housing and HAP transfer lists?<\/p> <p>  The next matter is affordable housing.  I appreciate that many local authorities are waiting to see what happens with the cost-rental pilot projects in Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Cork.  The serviced sites fund was initially made available to only a small number of local authorities, that is, to 11 of them, but the expectation is that it will be made available to others.  What is the view in the housing departments within the witnesses' local authorities as to the level of need for affordable housing, including purchase and rental, in their administrative areas?  If they have no idea of the need, which I suspect is the case given that I have no idea of what it is in my own local authority area, what must we do to establish what the level of need is?  Is the delivery of affordable rental or purchase homes led by local authorities and approved housing bodies factoring into their plans over the next number of years?<\/p> <p>  The third question relates to the infamous one-stage approval process.  Have the local authorities represented here today used the one-stage process?  If so, how much use was made of it?  If not, why has it not been used?  Is it because there are no projects of larger size or due to the risks involved?  What would the local authorities like to see in the amended one-stage process regarding the upper financial limits or a greater sharing of risk with the Department?  The age-old question is whether the four-stage process is improving.  We are talking to some local authorities which say it is not improving and that timelines are too slow with too much back and forth between local authorities and the Department at the approval stage.  When the witnesses' counterparts from other local authorities appeared before the committee recently, we asked them what we could do to speed up procurement.  Have any of the witnesses' authorities considered moving from having to tender every new build project to regional framework agreements whereby clusters of local authorities would work together on a big bag tender to get a certain number of contractors on the shelf for developments of up to 50 to 100 units?  What can we do?  Based on the witnesses' expertise on the procurement end, what could the committee argue for with the Department to speed that up?  The delay this causes in delivering projects is a source of frustration for many local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018120600002#E00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1544088600,"counter":2851,"content":"<p>As I am not a member of the committee, I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to come in for a few moments.  Can the chief executives outline how many people in their areas are in emergency accommodation and what they plan to do to get them out of it and into proper accommodation?  Are the numbers decreasing or increasing?  Is it still down to the developer, landowner or householder selling houses where people have rented houses?  Is it still due to banks repossessing or is it just that they are selling houses on the open market with an increase in the valuation of houses?<\/p> <p>  I will direct a few questions to Galway City Council.  I welcome Mr. Brendan McGrath, the chief executive, and Mr. Dermot Mahon.  How many houses is Galway short of at the moment?<\/p><p>How many houses are needed to get over the crisis?  What is being done to try to deliver that?  How many houses are the councils hoping to build between now and 2021?  What plans are in place to build these houses?  Have they been approved?  Have they gone to tender?  What blockages are there to completing projects?  Is it with getting approval from the Department or with getting contracts signed to get houses?  We have a major crisis.  I am sure every county has that.  As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, said, there has to be a mechanism for fast-tracking the building of houses.  I am aware of a scheme in County Galway which was held up in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for months to get approval, particularly about where windows would be in part of the development.  We were told there was only one architect in the Department.  Do the councils find that that still happens?<\/p><p> Does Galway County Council have enough land to deal with the housing crisis, not just for those in social or affordable housing, but for the ordinary people who want to buy a house?  We seem to forget about the young couples who do not qualify for social or affordable housing who want to buy a house.  I see it in Galway.  Is it happening in other parts of the country?  Is the State coming in and buying full housing estates?  I see there are a number of estates in Galway where the State has bought the whole lot in one fell swoop.  It is unfair on young couples who want to get on the property market.  They cannot bid against the State.  We have a housing crisis, including for young couples.  Many are heading back home and staying with their parents because they cannot afford to pay rent or to get on the property ladder, because the prices are going up, and they cannot bid against the State.<\/p><p> There is an issue in Galway which may be present around the country.  I go into Galway early every Sunday morning.  From the top of Shop Street to its end, I think I counted 22 rough sleepers indoors in the space of, at most, 100 m.  By 8.30 a.m., they were gone.  There was no sign of them.  They walked down the side ways.  It was as if they disappeared.  They come back at night between 11 p.m. and 12 midnight.  What is being done about that?  It is a disgrace to see so many.  I have walked along and looked at them and they are all foreign.  None is Irish.  I ask Mr. Brendan McGrath, as chief executive in Galway, if anything has been done.  Has there been a survey?  Has the council talked to them?  Who are they?  Where are they from?  What is being done to deal with that?  It is terrible looking in the mornings.  Many tourists walk around the city early in the morning and see that.  Is that being addressed?<\/p><p> Will Mr. McGrath outline the future development of Galway city?  I know he has done a lot of work, on which I compliment him on, in progressing the Ardaun corridor on the east side of Galway city.  The road has been downgraded.  Funding has been received to get access to it.  When does Mr. McGrath expect to see houses built on that?  How many houses does he hope will be built?  When does he expect to see people move in to these houses?  Will he outline how many people are in emergency accommodation in Galway?  When does he expect to be in a position to get that down to zero?  What is the trend of people getting into emergency accommodation?  How many present to Galway City Council as homeless in a month, on average?  Are they families, couples or single people?  Will Mr. McGrath and other chief executives outline the monthly trends of those presenting as homeless?<\/p><p> I am not a member of the committee but I thank the Vice Chairman for the opportunity to ask a few questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018120600002#E00600","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544088600,"counter":2853,"content":"<p>Maybe we will get answers to the first two questions first.

We have 189 adults and just over 100 children in emergency accommodation.  We recently opened the winter beds initiative, with which we increased capacity since last year.  We will have 36 beds available and we also have contingency beds if that is insufficient.  That will run through to next April and extend beyond that if necessary.  We also have a men's hostel, Fairgreen Hostel, run by COPE, a homeless charity in Galway, with 36 beds which are full.  The female hostel, where there are 13 beds, is also full.  This year, we have allocated social housing to 20 homeless families.  It is a difficult cycle and problem.  We have another 49 families on notices to quit who will conceivably come on to our homeless list in the first quarter of 2019.<\/p> <p>  We have made a significant number of interventions to deal with the homeless challenge.  It includes a homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, placefinder service which has been running since June.  We have already been able to house 27 families under homeless HAP.  Some 17 couples and single people who were registered have been housed under that initiative.  I referred to the cold weather response.  We recently purchased a family hub.  Renovation work is starting next week.  It will be up and running in the first quarter and that will accommodate 12 families.  We are rolling out a modular housing scheme comprising 15 prefabricated two and three bedroom units on lands in city ownership.  That will be up and running in early 2019.  Through the Housing First initiative, where we set ourselves a target of 30 Housing First tenancies, we have also secured funding through the social reform fund, a philanthropic fund.  It provides a wraparound service to homeless people who we are providing accommodation to and works with disability services, mental health services and the HSE.  Work has recently commenced on a new domestic violence refuge in the city which will be ready late next year.  That will provide nine additional accommodation units.<\/p> <p>  We have a rough sleeping problem.  We have and will have beds for everybody who needs a bed this winter.  The rough sleepers are largely non-habitual residents.  They do not have residency status.  They are generally eastern European.  We have engaged with them consistently but they have refused offers of support other than winter packs.  They are sadly destitute in their own countries.  Young people going out at night might give them money etc., and they do not want to engage with services.  They disappear the following morning and it is a problem we are trying to address.  To be frank, a policy intervention is probably needed involving the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality, relating to non-habitual residency, which would help to ameliorate the challenge.<\/p> <p>  With regard to housing supply, very little private housing has been built in Galway since 2007.  We estimate that there is a shortage of approximately 3,000 units.  The city's population is growing organically by approximately 1,000 people a year.  That would typically suggest that 300 or 350 units of accommodation are required to keep pace.  We probably have pent-up demand that needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p> Extant planning permissions in Galway city can deliver 6,020 units.  Our work on brownfield sites and the new suburb at Ardaun have the capacity to accommodate 3,500 accommodation units.  As Deputy Grealish mentioned, we have begun work on Ardaun.  In the past fortnight, we have attracted urban regeneration funds to deal with the access issues.  That funding will go to site in 2019.<\/p><p> The city council faces a challenge in terms of its landbanks.  We have 18 ha that are suitable for housing and are building on or are about to start building on 10 ha of that.  The next 6.5 ha will go to site next year.<\/p><p> Galway City Council has approximately 2,300 social houses.  By the end of 2021, we will have increased that number by 50%.  That will create its own challenge for us in terms of the maintenance and management of the increased stock and developing sustainable communities, but we are making significant inroads into tackling the issue.<\/p><p> One of the quirks of the lack of private building in Galway is that approximately 85% of what is being built is either going to approved housing bodies, AHBs, or is local authority building.  This means that there is a severe shortage of affordable and other housing options for people who fall outside the social housing qualification criteria.  The situation is exacerbated because, on the one hand, those people are generally in rented accommodation and rents are increasing because of the market shortage and, on the other, they are under pressure to meet the Central Bank's mortgage affordability criteria.<\/p><p> I believe I have answered most of the Deputy's questions.

I misunderstood.  In terms of the policy that we work under, all aspects of Rebuilding Ireland are worked on and delivered in order to provide appropriate accommodation for the people on our housing lists.  It is a different debate as to whether that is long term or another tenure element.  We will work to deliver on that in terms of whatever direction comes to us.  We have been successful in delivering under the policies that have been set to date, be that under the housing assistance payment, HAP, or the increased amount of leasing.  In turnkey operations, direct builds have been important.<\/p> <p>  We need to see a strong balance emerging between private sector building and public housing if we are to ensure an appropriate tenure mix while also meeting market demand.  This relates to the question of affordability.  Unless we start seeing a significant improvement in starter homes, we will never move to address that aspect of the situation.  One of the key areas that we would like to see more advancement on is the affordable loan that is available to people.  It is an excellent loan at a good rate.  It is a question of how to mobilise it and get it working more quickly so as to enable people to get starter homes and take some of the pressure off other sectors.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the speed of delivery.  Various policies over the past 30 years - I have worked under most of them - have seen the local authority being the provider, the introduction of AHBs and, at one stage, an emphasis being placed on AHBs.  Addressing that saw shifts in the various elements between private provision, AHBs and us.  Consequently, and particularly in the past eight years, local authorities have not been as geared up for delivery because a different sector was providing housing.  It has taken time to resource and rebuild our respective departments, personnel and expertise to drive forward with various types of build.  We have ramped up considerably.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 targets will be achieved overall, although individual targets pose challenges for the authorities for which they are set.  That is down to some of the processes.  Authorities will be up in some years and slightly down in others, but it is important that we be measured as a sector overall.  Turnkey operations are a vital part of that.  The four-stage process was mentioned but, in terms of direct build, committee members will see the speed with which turnkey operations can be turned around and delivered as distinct from the four-stage process.  That depends on the activity that is taking place within the respective county.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the four-stage process.  There have been improvements.  The introduction of the 59-week process has enabled us to work to more clearly defined timelines.  We would like to see further improvements.  It has been indicated that the four-stage process could be reduced to two.  The first stage would be a combination of the current stages 1 and 2, which would increase its sufficiency prior to formal planning permission.  That would be done to ensure we had confidence going forward.

I am fortunate in Limerick, in that we have supported the delivery of a number of critical Part 8 projects in recent times, which gives me a 2019 programme.  That does not happen everywhere, though, and depends on the challenges facing authorities.  The statutory timeframe does not take away from our obligation to ensure that the community is heard and the elected body has its say.  If we bring more surety to that and the staged process then delivers, local level will be given more accountability and responsibility for what it does.  That is the argument I would put forward.<\/p> <p>  Emergency homeless accommodation remains a serious challenge in various parts of the country.  We discuss it at an individual authority level as opposed to a sectoral level, as the challenges differ depending on where the authority is.  In my area, 31 families are in bed and breakfasts.  By the end of 2017, we had reduced the overall number of 79 families by 93% to five, but that number increased again during this year.  We have introduced two hubs with ten families and other sheltered accommodation.  Finding housing first is critical.  We are embarking on that successfully and ensuring that there is support for the families.  It is also important that the communities they are moving into be supported in looking after them.  Doing this has worked well for us.  In terms of the 31 families, I hope to have a new hub early in the new year.  There will be accommodation for everyone as we face into the winter, as Mr. McGrath indicated.<\/p> <p>  I should have referred to the delivery programme at the start.  People quickly forgot that we had an extraordinary winter that lasted five months at the beginning of the year.  It had an impact on direct delivery, not just for the public sector, but also for the private sector.  If we get a fair wind, we will see a continuous increase in delivery.<\/p> <p>  We have used the emergency planning powers to deliver hubs in the community.<\/p><p>It is not something we want to do in going against the wishes of the community or the council but it is there and we have used it practically to ensure it can be delivered.  The other aspect that perhaps will require a little more debate is the single stage, which is something we are looking at directly.  We have not used it to date, although we have one going through at this time.  Because of the complexity of the areas we were dealing with in the context of the city and metropolitan area, the single stage did not give the assurance in terms of the challenges that are sometimes faced on brownfield sites.  It is worth looking at.  It should be greater than &euro;2 million and should be far greater than eight units.

In regard to target versus need, the Louth target for 2018 is for 308 units, with a three-year target of 1,147.  We will be close to the 2018 target and I am confident that we will exceed the three-year target.  That target is largely being delivered through AHB-CALF funded units which are produced in significant numbers in Louth, largely due to the rent levels that can be achieved because the rental market is strong so close to Dublin.  That is probably the reason for the success of the CALF scheme.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the specific question on target versus need, if members refer back to the 1980s, which was seen as the most buoyant time for local authority construction, we were probably constructing in region of 250 units whereas our target now is 308.  While we feel our target is challenging, we will be close to it.  There will always be housing need and there always was &ndash; that is a fact of life.  It is a matter of catching up with what has happened in recent years.<\/p> <p>  On whether we think there is a need for affordable housing, there are two elements.  First, the market is not yet supporting affordable housing, and market price and construction price have not yet matched.  The availability of construction labour is heavily influencing the price of construction, particularly in Louth, because Dublin is sucking in all the skilled labour.  For us to get local labour, we have to cross the Border and most of our contractors are from Northern Ireland.  All of this is affecting the market price of a house.  The second point is whether there are people fit to acquire affordable units, and the financial institutions have a part to play in providing finance for those units.  We look at our rent schemes and our average rents are going up.  There is more money, therefore, and tenants have more money.  It is a question of supply and demand.  The Deputy is correct that it is a hard question to answer.<\/p> <p>  We have used the single-stage process once and we are currently using it for our CPO units, which we do in bundles.  It requires an element of work, particularly pre-planning work in preparing schemes and to ensure we have the costings correct.  The single-stage process has worked for us.  We welcome the first increase in the limits and we will welcome the second increase that is coming in January.   It requires an element of work which we are happy to take on.<\/p> <p>  With regard to emergency accommodation, Louth has a range of 120 to 160 adults in emergency accommodation, and we peaked at 160.  There are various reasons for presentation.  Our submission states that, traditionally, we always had a homeless population of perhaps 40 to 50 individuals, going right back to the 1980s.  The issue is the difference between 50 and 160.  It is a different cohort from previously.  We are talking about people who have lost units, particularly from the buy-to-let sector, where units have been taken back by the financial institutions.  One of the more significant grounds for presentation is where the landlord has lost the property and the tenant presents as homeless.  We never had families presenting as homeless before but we do now.  We have opened our first hub and used private leases and the HAP scheme to get accommodation for those people.  Nonetheless, homelessness is an everyday challenge, even in a small county like Louth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018120600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe McGuinness"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544088600,"counter":2886,"content":"<p>In Kerry we have strong, high targets.  Our target to the end of the period is 1,780 units, of which 840 are build, 310 are turnkey, 360 are acquisitions and 270 are lease.  They are strong targets and when we look at authorities in Cork, Dublin and Kildare, we see we have the highest targets in the country.  We certainly have a significant focus on achieving those targets.  With regard to land and social housing, we are building on every piece of land we can to achieve the targets, as well as actively acquiring land to build for our purposes.<\/p> <p>  With regard to affordability, Kerry is different from Louth in that there is the tourism factor.  With 2 million visitors to the county each year, the short-term lets and the Airbnb factor are strong in the competition between residential and tourism.  The change in policy will impact on Kerry.  Separately, we have seen some green shoots in the private market in parts of the county but there is little activity in other parts of the county.  Through our strong programme, the council will be the one developing houses in many areas across the county.  From meetings with the CIF in the county, we find that, as in Louth, it is cheaper to buy a property than it is to build one in parts of the county.<\/p> <p>  The matter of procurement was raised.  When looking at how to deliver in this regard, procurement is a vital part of any process, and there is also the rural factor.  Kerry County Council has built 65 local authority houses directly this year.  These have been small schemes of some 20 units and our programme has few large schemes because that is the type of county it is.  I take the point on regional procurement but it is important for our local labour market to have local procurement.  Having the skills and the contractors locally to deliver at a time we need them is important.<\/p> <p>  There is an increase in homelessness, with 131 adults and 63 dependents now homeless.  We do not have rough sleepers in the county.  While we are dealing with the situation, it is certainly something which has increased in the county.<\/p> <p>  We are working very closely on a cross-agency basis.  The wraparound services are strong and working well in the county.  We have seen an increase in resources recently, which is welcome.  We have had approval from the Department to use our resources for HAP placements, as has the HSE.<\/p><p>The HAP has been important for us in placing people.  With the HAP placement officer, we will continue to see that activity even within a shrinking market of available properties.  It will be important for us.  The strong housing programme should create some space within the private market in respect of homelessness and we are also in discussions with the Department about the creation of additional family hub facilities in the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018120600002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Murrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544088600,"counter":2888,"content":"<p>I remind members that we must conclude this meeting at 11.30 a.m. as we must have a 15-minute recess before we return to the Local Government Bill.

The homelessness crisis is acute throughout the country and I am aware from visiting local authorities and my own local authority in Fingal of the volume of work and emergency work that takes place.  The response has to be almost immediate and it is stressful for staff, which we cannot forget.  It is also stressful for people who are presenting in chaotic and difficult circumstances after being evicted or where a tenancy has been, or is due to be, ended.  I ask our guests to convey to their housing teams and the people associated with them my thanks and the thanks of the committee for the work they do every day, seven days per week.  I genuinely appreciate it.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues have covered a number of items so I will just make some brief comments.  I was interested in the question about affordability.  It emanated from the fact that the serviced site fund has increased to &euro;310 million over three years.  An affordable housing scheme will be established and it will focus on areas where there are affordability issues.  I do not expect that it will be opened in areas where there are no such issues.  I have a question on the Rebuilding Ireland loans, improvements to that system, common criteria and common financial underwriting.

Are the criteria for financial underwriting for the Rebuilding Ireland loans uniform among local authorities?  I have evidence they are not.  I raised it with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and he said there is a review taking place to ensure that is happening.  Can Mr. Murray advise the committee on the interaction with the Housing Agency <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the loans?  Is each loan application going to the agency for oversight if not approval?<\/p><p>I refer to the use of CPO powers, which all the witnesses alluded to it in their opening statements.  It has been useful to get a picture from four local authorities outside Dublin and to consider the different housing issues throughout the country.  The figures are different.  In each of the opening statements the witnesses referred to purchasing units.  Louth County Council has 84 completions, according to the latest figures, in acquiring vacant houses and bringing them back into use.  That is a good performance and I commend the council on it.  The council has been put forward as an example of how this can be done.  There have been no completions in Galway city.  That is also the case in Kerry County Council and Limerick.  This is since 2011 and under the CPO powers.  That information was received under a freedom of information request I made.  I note that the witnesses spoke in their opening statements about acquiring buildings, but the information I received from the Department states that Louth is miles ahead of other councils.  Is there an issue with using the CPO powers?  Do local authorities not want to use them?  The Minister has said on a number of occasions that the threat of the use of CPO might be enough.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the success Louth has had in bringing vacant units into use.  Galway City Council has identified approximately 500 derelict or unused buildings:<\/p><blockquote>...the council prepared a vacant home strategy which is currently being implemented.  The initial estimates put the number of vacant homes in the city at <i>circa<\/i>500. <\/blockquote> <p>However, the council has completed no CPO since 2011.  Why is that?  What other strategies is the council using?  I am seeking the council's feedback on that; it is not a criticism.  I want to get under the bonnet to see what the issue is.<\/p><p>The discretionary cap has been referred to in the single stage process that Mr. McGuinness has used.  What impact will the increase in that cap to &euro;6 million have when it is introduced in January with regard to giving councils control over delivering smaller social housing schemes?  The increase was agreed in the last budget.<\/p><p>I was interested to hear Mr. McGrath speak about the HAP homeless placefinder service in Galway.  Does each local authority have that service?  One of the issues our party is considering is people presenting as homeless after the fact.  In some local authorities - I do not know if this happens in the ones represented by the witnesses - people are told to come back when the tenancy has ceased.  If people come to the local authorities represented here and they know they are going to be evicted or their lease expires in 60 or 80 days, what is the process in the local authority?  Will Mr. McGrath speak in more detail about the placefinder service with which the council has had some success?<\/p><p>I will conclude with a question on HAP.  Do the councils represented here remove their HAP clients from the main housing list and put them on the transfer list?  Some local authorities have stopped doing that.  What are the witnesses' views on it?  It is not a policy question.  I am asking it from an operational perspective.  I disagree with it.  HAP tenants should stay on the main housing list where there is proper oversight.  Do the witnesses remove somebody who is placed in a HAP tenancy from the housing list?  My main criticism of Rebuilding Ireland is the overdependence on the private rental sector and particularly HAP.  More than 50% of our targets are to be met by people being deemed housed when their need is met by entering into what is mainly a short-term lease.  My party's view of that is that their housing need has not been met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018120600002#J00500","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1544088600,"counter":2892,"content":"<p>It is not often one gets an opportunity to praise one's council's officials and former officials.  Mr. Conn Murray was the manager in Louth for a successful period.  Mr. Joe McGuinness has been fantastic in his commitment and the work he has done in County Louth in respect of CPOs, as has Mr. Paddy Donnelly.  They are changing roles at the moment.  The benchmark for efficiency and accountability is what Louth County Council is doing on housing.  I was glad to hear Deputy Darragh O'Brien praising the work in County Louth.<\/p> <p>  I have said a number of times in this committee that the CPO project needs a national lead.  I have also said it to the Minister.  We ought to have somebody in charge of CPO nationally for the councils that are not doing their job.  I am not naming any council here other than Louth, which is doing a great job.  We could get 2,000 to 3,000 homes in the space of 18 months if it was properly led with the enthusiasm and commitment shown in Louth County Council.  I have travelled around my town with a housing body and the body has picked up a number of homes and is refurbishing them.  The easy win is where one has the services and one does not have to open up any land.  One has to reconstruct or rebuild the property but all the services, such as the footpaths, roads, lighting, sewerage and water, are in place so it is a cheaper operation.  The witnesses can confirm this but I believe the average cost was &euro;100,000 to &euro;110,000 for the CPO purchase from start to finish.  That included all legal and reconstruction or refurbishment costs.<\/p><p>That is very advantageous to the taxpayer and to the families who go in there.  It is a real blindspot in other counties and has to be driven.  I would appreciate the views of the witnesses because every town centre is full of properties that could be activated.  Do the council officials feel there is a need to, or what do they do, to generate business in this area?<\/p><p> I know the council identifies empty homes that are boarded up and there is a website for that.  How active are councils where properties are unoccupied particularly in town centres or in brownfield areas in chasing up the owners to see what they are doing with them and engage with them?  What incentives are available to property owners even if they are commercial properties to make them into family homes or one or two bedroom units?  That would make a huge difference.  <\/p><p> I wonder if any of my colleagues from the county council remember &ndash; I might have served even longer than they have &ndash; when people were on the housing list for one year before getting a house.

The Minister told me in the D&aacute;il that if any local authority is not in a position to repair voids in its area and it submits an application in that respect by 14 December, he would be prepared to provide additional money for the repair of voids.  He said that categorically last week.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of CPOs, I will not repeat the praise of various local authorities in that respect.  As a few of the representatives will be aware, I have had a bee in my bonnet for many years about the issue of vacant rural housing.  There has been a great concentration on addressing urban vacant housing.  Anybody who was a candidate in the local authority elections and has traversed the roads will know the degree of vacant rural housing.  Those properties have been identified.  If one or two such properties were taken back into use in every parish, it would rejuvenate local schools facing challenges and it would provide funding for the local community.  By developing the synergies of the IFA and community organisations and making funding available, not necessarily to the local authority but with the help of the local authority, many of those vacant properties could be identified.  Such vacant properties exist and in some of them there is furniture, although I acknowledge there are legal issues regarding some of them.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the issue of student accommodation.  I note that many of the traditional houses in the vicinity of Dundalk Institute of Technology in my constituency have large gardens.  I mentioned to Deputy Darragh O'Brien that an incentive should be offered to encourage homeowners to build granny flats or single extensions to the rear of properties with large gardens in the vicinity of college areas.  Incentives could be offered to property owners, many of whom would be elderly, to provide a sun-room type accommodation for students and a grant could be provided to people who own plots of land for such development.  Has any of the representatives a view on that proposal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018120600002#L00800","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1544088600,"counter":2919,"content":"<p>To return to my original question regarding the gap between the real social housing need and the targets in terms of the increase in real stock, the problem is that in each of the four local authorities represented, the gap is very stark.  For example, in Galway, the gap between the additions to the stock over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland and the real level of need is about 65%; in Louth, it is 74%; in Kerry, it is 59%; and in Limerick, it is 71%.  Given the fact that a number of the representatives have said that private sector activity is very slow, if so much of social housing need is to be met outside of local authorities' approved housing bodies' builds and acquisitions, and if the private sector is not building, they will not be able to meet the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, targets.  Leaving aside the fact that HAP and RAS provide security for two or four years, and therefore are not necessarily in the best interests of tenant or good development of communities, that gap is massive.  It is very worrying.  I acknowledge the representatives have to work within the existing policy and that the targets are set not on the basis of what they would like to do but by the Department.  The gap is very big and that will create some difficulties.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, the product is very good but the figures as of September for the four local authorities are troubling.  For example, Galway city and county councils sent 83 loan applications to the Housing Agency for underwriting, 22 were recommended and as of September zero have been drawn down.  In the case of Louth County Council, 50 loan applications were sent to the Housing Agency, 19 were recommended for approval and only five have been drawn down.  In the case of Kerry County Council, 60 loan applications were sent to the Housing Agency for approval, 26 were recommended and zero have been drawn down.  In the case of Limerick, the respective figures are 46 loan applications, 28 were recommended and zero have been drawn down.  I acknowledge it is only the first three quarters of the scheme and that does not give us a full indication but clearly there is a problem.  Is it that the period between the date of application and the date of final approval is longer than is necessary for the person meant to be able to purchase his or her home?  Is it that the amounts being offered are less than what the applicants need to purchase their home?  This is not a critical comment of the local authorities or the Housing Agency but clearly the draw downs indicate there is a problem.  Those figures I gave for the local authorities sending loan applications to the Housing Agency represent approximately half of the number of applications received.  Half of the applications made, on average, are not sent to the Housing Agency.  I would be interested to hear the representatives views on that matter.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Traveller accommodation and taking account of the budgets for last year and this year, Limerick had a significant overspend in its Traveller accommodation budget last year but as of half way through this year it is way behind the completion of the full spend this year.  Louth did not have an allocation for or a spend on Traveller accommodation last year but it is significantly behind its allocation for this year.  Kerry spent roughly what it was allocated for Traveller accommodation last year but as of half way through this year it has not spent any of the allocation.  In Galway City Council there was a dramatic underspend on Traveller accommodation last year; there was no spend on it in the Galway County Council despite a significant allocation and as of half way through this year the county council had not drawn anything down and the city council had drawn down a fraction of the &euro;1 million or so that was allocated.  My specific question is whether the representatives envisage their local authorities will spend all the money that was allocated this year and whether those that underspent last year will carry that over.  One of the major concerns of this committee is that year on year there are very significant underspends.  While I live in the real world and there is a large Traveller community in my constituency, I understand the complexities involved.  We are due to have Revised Estimates next week.  There has been a significant overspend in social housing and we had a significant overspend in social housing last year.  That is very welcome but there was a significant underspend on Traveller accommodation over the last three years, which is very troubling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018120600002#L00900","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1544088600,"counter":2920,"content":"<p>I will bring in the representatives starting with those representing Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018120600002#L01000","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1544088600,"counter":2921,"content":"<p>I will let Mr. Conn Murray pick up on some of the general questions.

The decision comes back to our credit committee and we do not always agree with what the Housing Agency recommends.  There is not any delay at that end.<\/p><p>The student accommodation in Galway is quite significant and 1,000 student beds have recently come through, or are in the planning process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

Counties Waterford and Kilkenny were also mentioned in that context.  There is another very serious development which, if it were to take hold, would have huge ramifications for democracy.  In recent years I have noted a move towards corporatism, a European idea of the 1930s that, thankfully, we eschewed in favour of democracy.  The idea is that representative groups form the ruling structures, rather than allowing a system of one person, one vote at a certain age, regardless of whether people are well educated.  This measure seems to be putting a toe in the water in respect of a wider thought process and I suspect that is all it is.  The new committee will have a mixture of elected individuals and nominees who will be nominated by the cathaoirligh.  However, we have no idea of what the constraints will be.  It is one of those selective processes where certain qualifications put a person in the \"in\" group in society and get them onto committees such as this.  It contrasts with being selected by one's peers, by which I mean the electorate.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal refers to people with experience in the provision of transport and housing, the development of infrastructure or business and trade.  I note that they will not have a vote, although that could change later.  However, they will have enormous influence, which is why they are being put there.  They would not be there if they were not going to have enormous influence.  I see the process being widened progressively to the general local authority scene because that is how the system works.  It is a big idea, but it will hit a wall if it moves forward too quickly; therefore, it will creep forward.  Nevertheless, the people involved will be given the most significant of powers, namely, the power to be involved in planning.<\/p>  <p>  The new group is not representative.  There will be no one on it from RAPID programme areas.  The people chosen who will be upper middle class and living in salubrious surroundings will have power over those living in less salubrious surroundings in towns, many of which are included in RAPID programme areas.  People living in housing estates bring a lot of expertise, as well as knowledge of what it is like to be at the bottom of the pile and have planning ideas imposed on them without much choice.  Urban areas by far have the biggest social problems and levels of deprivation.  Poor urban areas have the biggest drug problems because of social segregation, but the people who will be nominated will come from a certain class and not have suffered the effects of the problems mentioned.  I suggest the Minister of State looks at this matter again.  If we want good planning, we need to ensure these urban communities will be represented.  They have tended to be represented in the normal democratic way by virtue of being numerous, but the Minister is including super influencers to take away that power.<\/p>  <p>  The other sector that is totally being ignored is the community and voluntary sector which is of enormous importance in terms of the well-being of Irish society.  If we were to take that sector out of the communities in which we all live, they would be destroyed because a lot of what is good, positive and wholesome and gives huge satisfaction to people does not come under the heading of \"It is the economy, stupid \".  That is such a trite statement because it is not all about the economy but about quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  While the amendments do not directly relate to Galway, they are a precursor of the new approach to local authorities.  They are putting the toe in the water for the first time in respect of a new approach that indicates to us that we cannot trust the people elected by the people and that we need to get the elite in control.  It is to state, \"If we get away with this, we will keep going\".  It derives from European thinking of the 1930s and we all know what happened in those years.  Thankfully, this was an ordinary plain democracy that was run by the people for the people and we avoided many of the conflicts to which the other approach led.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600003#B00500","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1544096400,"counter":2961,"content":"<p>Most of the questions on the amendments were asked last night, but Deputy O'Dowd had some further questions he wanted to ask.

I am not criticising the committee, but they all flow from a report adopted by the Government six months ago which was sent to the committee.<\/p> <p>I have always said there should be two committees in this area.  In the case of the four areas where boundary reviews were conducted, there was an acceptance - even taking me out of the picture, which is difficult to do - that by their nature issues in towns and cities that crossed boundaries were intractable.  It goes to the heart of the Irish identity, the connection with place, parish, community and county.  It was felt, even before I arrived in this position, that we had to look at some new structure that would allow county boundaries to remain as they were but that would also allow for the proper planning and development of cities that spilled into two local authority areas.  I do not know if there are cities that spill into three local authority areas.  The amendments deal solely with towns with a population between 1,500 and 100,000.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that things that work well in one area may not work well in another, which is a fair point.  The premise is to have a full development plan for these towns.  At present both local authorities do their own thing.  A good example was mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Broin last night.  He said there had been good co-operation since the 1950s between the authorities in Carlow town and County Laois.  With many shared services, at the end of the year a cheque is exchanged.  The local authority in Carlow is delivering services for thousands of people who live in County Laois.  It was mentioned in one of the boundary review reports, in respect of which, interestingly, there were only seven submissions received from the general public.  Deputy Eugene Murphy would know about the 20,000 plus submissions received in County Roscommon, while approximately the same number of submissions were received in my own neck of the woods.  However, only seven people living in County Laois and Carlow made submissions because the co-operation had worked, but it is non-statutory.  They also compile their own local area plans independently.  What we are looking at is providing for functions that are either not performed fully or not performed at all under the existing local government structure.  One of the key of functions functions is being provided for to deal with the inability of the system to compile a full plan for a town or a city.<\/p> <p> Every speaker raised this issue.  Deputy O'Dowd gave a real example in outlining why this measure or its equivalent was needed.  I emphasise that I am fully open - it will be at least two weeks before we take Report Stage - to sitting down with spokespersons and whoever else wants to attend from the different groups and the Independents to discuss the issue.  To accommmodate them, I will table my own ministerial amendments.  There is nothing underhand being done.  In every speech I have made to local authority members, the management association and in the Chamber, both on this Bill and Private Members' Bills on town councils, of which there have been a few, I have spelled out that there will be a joint structure to deal with forward planning in towns and cities.  That is what the Bill aims to achieve.  My private secretary will email all members of the joint committee - other colleagues can be brought along if they so wish - and on Tuesday of next week they can sit down with me and the officials to identify the wording or hierarchy to be used.  I believe that is what Deputy &Oacute; Broin was referring to yesterday.  <\/p> <p> I am acutely aware that I was attacked from all sides on Deputy Cullinane's local radio station.  It was said this was my revenge on Waterford, but nothing could be further from the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600003#B00700","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544097000,"counter":2964,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister of State does not mean that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600004#C00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1544097000,"counter":2965,"content":"<p>The Deputy was not involved, but lots of my own were.  It is a well flagged and genuine attempt to do something new to deal with the intractable boundaries problem.<\/p>  <p>  Let me give the final explanation as to how we arrived at this measure.  Essentially, what we are asking is that the smaller local authority give up its power to produce a local area plan.  In the case of Drogheda which was mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd, it will mean that Meath County Council will select three members, with Louth County Council.  They will adopt the local area plan for the urban area, most of which is within the boundaries of County Louth.  On the county development plan, they will not do what they did in Drogheda and resile from the joint agreement.  We can avoid the scenarios that were discussed.  It was Deputy &Oacute; Broin or someone else who raised the question of what had emerged in Cork during the years, where the county council was zoning land for housing development on the boundary between the city and the county which resulted in the creation of new settlements.  I am open to changing the amendments in whatever way we can to accommodate the concerns of members of the committee.  We will have multiple meetings in the two weeks in the lead-up to Report Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal with a number of other specific issues.  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v comments, I am not particularly wedded to the idea of having outside people.  I emphasise for the Deputy and everybody else present that the role of the groups is to perform functions that are not performed adequately or not at all by councils.  There was no question of having council planners or planning staff included as the experts.  We were looking at the forward planning aspect.  I will have no difficulty in accepting amendments on Report Stage.  I completely accept the Deputy's idea on RAPID programme areas and about the community and voluntary sector in general.<\/p>  <p>  I believe I have answered most of the questions that were asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600004#C00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1544097000,"counter":2966,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State did not deal with most of my questions, please allow me to go through them again.  I fully accept that the intention behind the Bill to solve what is a particularly difficult problem, about which there is no dispute.  I also accept that the Minister of State flagged the general principle.  Nonetheless, I believe he is underestimating the concerns of committee members in the sense that we are only being given two days to consider the detail of his proposals.  There is a big difference between being given a general indication of the policy direction and flagging it and having adequate time to scrutinise the detail of proposals.  It is not that we want lots of time to scrutinise them.  The committee is incredibly flexible with all of the Minister of State's other ministerial colleagues in providing time, but because of the length of time we are being given to scrutinise the proposals, it is genuinely very tough for us.  I am still not clear on why it is that we are being given so little time.  For example, when we look at earlier amendments on the holding of plebiscites, there is a very clear rationale as to why the Minister of States needs to include them in the Bill because there is a deadline to meet in compiling the registers, etc.  Therefore, I would like to be convinced that this amendment has to be included now, rather than in a stand-alone Bill or in the Local Government Bill 2019.<\/p>  <p>  On the ratio of elected representatives to voters, I have still not heard an adequate explanation.  I am not making the argument that there should be exact proportionality.  If there was, those in the smaller adjoining local authority would fear that they would be swamped by those in the larger area.  I accept that it works both ways.  What I do not understand is the reason there should be a simple rigid formula of three and three elected members, with the chairpersons or mayors, as opposed to other options because there will be variations in size.  I do not know the demographics of each of the areas listed by the Minister of State, but it seems that there should be some way of thinking it through to avoid the problem he identified to me informally after the meeting, that if you give one too much weight, it will mean that nothing will be agreed.  However, I am yet be convinced on that point.<\/p>  <p>  The next issue concerns the process of appointment of elected members.  For example, if mine was the majority party in the two councils, is it the case that we could elect the six members?  Where would that leave the smaller parties in terms of diversity in representation?  Likewise, we must consider the geographical locations of the elected representatives.<\/p> <p>I have not heard the Minister of State address how we deal with that or the question about staff.  If I am reading the Bill right, the committee will decide what staff it requires from the existing local authorities.  Does that have to be approved by the chief executives of those local authorities?  Can the chief executives object?  What happens if the staff that the committee requests are already busy doing something else?  We know there are pressures across all council departments.  How will those functions be replaced within existing staff complements?<\/p> <p> Whatever this committee decides will have a financial implication which will have to be borne by the two local authorities.  How will that work?  What happens if there are significant disagreements over budgets, zoning or other things?  I am not saying that we should go back to the Drogheda example where local authorities are allowed to block everything.  The option the Minister of State has put on the table is not the only one and is not necessarily the clear option.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies asked a reasonable question yesterday about the statutory consultative process with county development plans and local area plans.  The local authorities know which steps they have to go through.  It is not clear from this what that consultative process is.  It is certainly not clear to elected members of the councils or the public, from engagement with them.  I will go back to what I said at the start.  None of us is trying to be difficult or block the Minister of State from having a solution but in the absence of adequate time to go through all these things and be convinced that what he is proposing is the right way to fix this, many of us will be left in a position of not being able to support it today.  I understand his offer to sit down next week and come back with amendments the following week.  That is still a very tight timeframe for something that is relatively complex.  I appreciate the Minister of State and his officials have been working on it for some time but those of us who are only taking it up now have many other significant things on our schedule in these couple of weeks.  Would it not make more sense for the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment at this stage?  We will take the offer of engaging with him both immediately before and after Christmas and insert this into the local government Bill 2019.  Would that not make more sense rather than trying to shoehorn it into the 2018 Bill within a short timeframe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600004#C00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544097600,"counter":2968,"content":"<p>The majority of people here are not against this concept.  We are all in favour of it.  We have worked positively on all legislation that has come through here.  This legislation came to us on Tuesday night and this is the first time that we have seen the detail that we are being asked to agree.  The Government introduced 71 amendments on Report Stage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act last year.  We have to be given time.  This is a positive move but it needs to be looked at critically.  We have not had the opportunity to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Where does the urban area plan sit in the planning hierarchy?  It is not the national development plan, a regional plan, county plan, environs plan or local area plan.  Is it part of the county development plan or does it sit outside it, standing in its own right like some of the environs plans around the country that go through the same process as the county development plan?  Does the consultation have to follow the same procedures as those plans?  I cannot see that with the way I am reading this.  The other area I was concerned about was the land-grabbing.  Sorry, I will not call it grabbing.  There is no reference to public consultation about the initial boundary, which is in amendment No. 112.<\/p>  <p>  Going back to what I raised last night, the more I think about this, the stronger I become on it.  The Minister of State said we do not have the expertise and that is why we are considering bringing it in from outside.  How do we not have the expertise for our local area, county and regional plans?  The expertise at local authority level is there for all those plans and is there for these plans.  This should remain in the control of public representatives and we need to return trust on this to public representatives.  The Minister of State is saying one thing here yet we are adopting many other higher, greater plans without that cohort of people.  I do not see the logic behind it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Brien found out last night that Bray is one of the areas in this.  I am not sure that the local authority in Bray is even aware that this is coming down the track.  Since the establishment of the municipal district, it has spent the whole time creating a municipal district plan to encompass the whole municipal district around Bray.  Now we are told that there will be another plan which will incorporate part of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Bray will have 75% of the population and landmass with D&uacute;n Laoghaire having 25%.  We then get into the area of proportionality.  Can the smaller side control it?  I want to support this legislation.

I do not intend to get caught up in the hyperbole of this issue with regard to the commentary that will flow from this locally.  It is obviously an issue that will be contentious in Waterford and Kilkenny.  This boundary issue has been contentious for some time.  I have not been one of the politicians that has increased the temperature on the issue and I accept that we need to have a structure, process and framework in place that focuses on the needs of the people who live there and not on all the other issues that seem to gravitate around this issue, which are sometimes somewhat unhelpful.  I have no difficulty in principle with a solution being found.  The difficulty is that the solution which has been brought to the table is very late in the day in a Bill which was designed to do something else.  Notwithstanding that the Minister of State flagged up that he intended to look at a solution and mechanism such as this, the detail of it is now before us and concerns us.  I have spoken to councillors and the management in Waterford and they are concerned about the process.  They have no problem with good planning and sustainable development but they have concerns about the democratic element in this.<\/p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to help me to understand how this would work in practice.  We have the example of Waterford and Kilkenny.  I understand that this urban district committee would involve the metropolitan area of Waterford city and the part of south Kilkenny that was subject to a potential boundary extension.  Approximately 45,000 live in the metropolitan part of Waterford city and approximately 7,000 live in that part of south Kilkenny, coming to approximately 52,000.  The vast majority live in Waterford, yet there are three elected representatives from Kilkenny and three from Waterford.  The Minister of State can obviously see how difficult that will be from a democratic point of view for people who live in Waterford.  They will be very concerned about that.  That just relates to the composition of it, not the people who will come from outside, as Teachta Casey mentioned.  The powers and functions that the committee will have will concern members even more.  What relationship will it have with the two councils and, specifically for me, what relationship will it have with Waterford City and County Council?  My understanding of the amendments is that they will have powers to formulate their own local area plan but will that local area plan be able to supersede area plans which have already been crafted by local authorities?  If that is the case, that creates other democratic problems in the sense that there are 32 councillors in Waterford who could formulate a plan which could then be superseded by a smaller number who are not elected to that body.  We do not know how they are appointed.<\/p> <p>That is going to be problematic.  The same thing applies in the case of development plans.  Will these other councillors be able to vary development plans?  If so, how will that work in practice?<\/p> <p> I will give a simple example of the types of practical things that need to be worked out.  If the committee of six councillors decides that under the local area plan, a road should be built somewhere entirely within its geographical area, which will include the entire area of Waterford city and the smaller area, there will be budgetary implications.  Given that the budget is decided by the councils, how will this work?  People are struggling to understand how it will work practically.  The Minister of State is correct when he says that this proposal has not gone down well in Waterford for all of these reasons.  People are not opposed to a solution, but they do not like this solution.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I think it would be better if the Minister of State were to withdraw these amendments.  I know from speaking to management personnel in Waterford City Council that they have not been consulted.  They are aware that some sort of proposition is being put on the table, but they have not been consulted on the detail.  How can we force something on local authorities when local authority management is saying it does not see how it will work?  Neither management nor councillors has been consulted.  The Minister of State has said that members of his own party in my constituency are concerned about this as well.  Strong language may have been used if emotions were running high.  They are concerned and they should be consulted.<\/p> <p> I suggest it would be best to withdraw these amendments at this point.  My strong advice to the Minister of State is to withdraw them and revisit them either in the 2019 Bill that has been mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Broin or in a separate stand-alone Bill.  We need to examine this dispassionately and appropriately without jumping to conclusions.  It should be given the proper consideration.  We need to look at how it would work practically.  I am certainly up for that.  I want something that will work.  I do not believe the process that is envisaged here will work for Waterford and Kilkenny, whatever about the other areas.  A one-size-fits-all approach will not work here.  I have set out my concerns.  As I have to return to the Committee of Public Accounts, I might not be here when the Minister of State responds.  I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Broin will update me on what he says.  I thank the Chair for her indulgence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600005#D00800","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544098200,"counter":2976,"content":"<p>I want to get clarification on something.

Many fairly specific questions have been asked.  I took all the notes last night.  It was only when Deputy &Oacute; Broin was going through his issues that I used a highlighter to highlight them.  On the time issue, it is intended, as it has been all along, that these structures will come into place when the new councils are elected.  With the best will in the world, next year's local government Bill, which will deal primarily with Galway, will not come into effect until well after the local elections.  I want to say in response to the queries of all Deputies that I am asking them not to vote down these amendments on the basis of my commitment that I will withdraw the whole lot of them if we cannot come up with something constructive in the two weeks before Report Stage.  I agree that this is substantive.  I have been buried in this issue for all of my life.  I suppose I have a unique kind of appreciation of it.  I do not want to be seen to do anything that disadvantages anyone.  I hope we can figure out some amendments within the two-week period I have mentioned.  I am willing to introduce those amendments.  If they are not agreeable, I will withdraw this section.<\/p>  <p>  I have not heard anyone disagreeing with the idea I am advancing.  The principal objections relate to the composition.  The problem with the composition is that a fear factor kicks in when a smaller local authority is told it will lose its power to do its local area plan.  The fear is that the larger local authority, which could dominate these committees on a proportionality basis, will just dictate in a way that brings about a boundary change by the back door.  I am not going to be dishonest to the Deputies here.  There is no attempt to suggest that it is proportional.  It is a very genuine attempt to deal with a completely intractable issue.  We all know that no county boundaries will be changed for the foreseeable future of the Oireachtas.  That is the position as far as any of us can tell.  In such circumstances, how can we use the existing structures to create something new that looks at these towns and cities in their entirety?  That is where I am coming from with this idea.<\/p>  <p>  The members of these committees will be elected from the local authority electoral area adjacent to the town or city.

I am open to extending the backgrounds from which they might come.  I hear what members are saying.  Deputy Casey said it strongly.  He said it might seem in the cold light of day that I am trying to take powers off councillors.  Local authority representative groups have expressed support for the idea that, in certain limited circumstances, somebody from business could be involved.  In the Waterford example, it could be a representative of the traders in the middle of the city.  Business and trade has been mentioned.

We are giving them the freedom to make that choice.  It may be the case that a one-size-fits-all approach would not work.  It might apply in Bray and it might not apply in Waterford, or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We are not prescriptive.  The existing statutory provisions for the drawing up of local area plans are being retained.  We are not changing a word of the consultation questions that are asked, or of the engagement with the public.<\/p> <p>That all has to be done the same.  I do not accept the argument about staff.  The staff in the local authorities are doing these local area plans anyway.  In this instance we are talking about staff being effectively seconded.  They are not going to be body corporate.  They will not have separate budgets.  The staff that currently do the local area plans in both local authorities will do it together for the whole town.  That is the thinking behind the proposal.  There will not be that cost as it is being borne by the local authorities anyway.  Rather than having two plans, we just want to have one area plan that will make sense of both areas together.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cullinane referred to budget implications in planning for funding, but this is already the case.  If a road is proposed in one of these areas that crosses the boundary from Meath, for example, into Louth, there are a number of mechanisms they can use.  Both local authorities can apply separately or there can be a lead authority if they agree this is a measure they want to do.  Those mechanisms will remain in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600006#E00900","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544098800,"counter":2985,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Minister of State after I have let some other members in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600007#F00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1544098800,"counter":2986,"content":"<p>I will follow on from Deputy Casey's comments.  The genuine concerns he raised around formalising synergy, shared interests, works programmes and goals between areas that cross county boundaries make absolute sense.  I could argue about the composition, and I will, but we also need to get the sequencing right.  There is a lot of additional work.  We have covered many of the points, including during last night's meeting, but this proposal needs a review period.  If we are to do it, then a review period needs to be formally built into it.  If the idea is to be rolled out to eight areas and if it works, there are more areas it could also go to.  I had mentioned some areas to the Minister of State at yesterday's discussion.  I have concerns around the timing but I take the Minister of State's point that the report was agreed by Government and laid before the committee.<\/p>  <p>  I and my party want to be reasonable in how we approach this.  I could agree that we would go to the next stage but, if I am not happy, as the spokesperson for my party, I reserve the right to table amendments on Report Stage to withdraw these sections in their entirety.  I would do that because I absolutely agree with the concept.  I have seen the issues in local authorities across the State and in my own local authority.  We need that level of formalisation.  We would have worked with the Minister of State through the process if I had known about it, but it was not on my radar and I do not believe it was on the radar of any of my colleagues that this was coming down the track.  There is more in the Bill that I agree with than I disagree with.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of being constructive on these sections, I agree with Deputy Casey that the membership of the urban district committees should be for elected members.  I feel very strongly about this.  I have no issue in consulting such a consultative committee, which is useful, and I have been involved in consultative committees in the D&aacute;il and in local authorities with interested groups of people.  They were not from elite or exclusive communities.  They were from the whole community.  That is what I am interested in, as are all of us.  The proportionality piece needs to be dealt with along with how the members of the body are selected.  We need to get under the bonnet a little bit more on this, so to speak.  I am happy to engage with the Minister of State from Tuesday.<\/p>  <p>  I and my party colleagues have been working through this Bill since yesterday to put forward the changes we would like to see.  As I said yesterday, there are some issues with it but I will assent to letting it go to Report Stage.

I did not hear a lot of what has happened but I am not out of sympathy with what I have heard so far.<\/p>  <p>  Consider the Drogheda-east Meath experience.  I referred yesterday to the controversy that arose there between the two statutory authorities having agreed a plan but which did not have statutory powers.  The local council overrode that plan.  As a result, green belts were no longer green belts, areas that had not been zoned for housing were then zoned, X had land zoned by the county council plan and then it turned out that Y was a beneficiary with regard to zoning.  What we are talking about, when one gets down to it, is green belt planning, recreation and amenity planning and zoning.  Those are the three issues that have to be transparent, accountable and above board in every respect.<\/p>  <p>  I read through the minutes of Meath County Council and I went back years to look at what was going on.  Perhaps some people in the Department may have read them also.  The point now is what the Department is proposing to do.  Take Drogheda as a model.  Drogheda would have three members on the new body and Laytown-Bettystown would have three members.  I do not have a difficulty with that.  It is a very good thing that they talk to each other because people in one area might have recreational amenities, for example, the Laytown beaches and so on, and the people in those areas may come into Drogheda for their hospitals or education.  That is a good synergy.  My question is around the county development plan, the zoning issues and the green belt issues.  If, as arose before, the county council's view is that the green belt should be from A to B, and if this new committee says the opposite, who is the authority on that planning decision?  I believe this is at the heart of the matter.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key problems was illustrated when a group of developers understood from meetings with key people, which were well documented, that they would have zoning for X and they did not get it.  This was one of the rows that happened.  I and everybody else wants this never to happen again.  We need transparency, accountability and a direct line of accountability, with input from wherever it should come from.  There must be authoritative, definitive and proper planning in terms of green belt areas, and in recreation and amenity.  This is very important.  Otherwise we might find vast areas of land rezoned for housing, with no proper amenities put in place.  There are a substantial number of houses with very few amenities in the east Meath region.  It was done the wrong way.  That is being addressed now but I am conscious that this could happen again.  Perhaps the Minister of State could come back on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600007#F00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1544098800,"counter":2988,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for engaging with us constructively on this.

If something were to happen to an appointed joint chief executive officer, therefore, another could be appointed.<\/p><p>The section seeks to put in place one chief executive with responsibility for both local authorities in Galway.  It arises out of a Government decision taken a number of months ago and will allow for a limited amount of administrative integration.  It does not at this stage diminish the legal position of either local authority.  The scheduled 2019 local elections will be held by the two existing authorities as currently constituted with two separate plenary councils.  The decision to progress preliminary work to set out the basis for a future merger arises from the work of the independent Galway local government committee, which unanimously recommended the establishment of a new unified Galway authority rather than boundary alteration or retention of the <i>status quo <\/i>in the local authority areas in Galway.<\/p> <p>The group concluded this would maximise the potential of the region to maintain, secure and grow a sustainable economic base into the future, combining the respective strengths of the two existing authorities in terms of resources, staff and expertise.<\/p> <p> A subsequent expert advisory group was established in December 2016 to carry out further detailed examination and planning arising from the 2015 recommendation.  The group endorsed and confirmed the recommendation in 2015 of the Galway local government review committee report for amalgamation between the city and county councils, and stated this is now all the more urgent in order to capitalise on the funding opportunities under the national planning framework and the capital programme, and to have the capacity to engage in activity such as capital development funded by borrowings.  The group was unanimous in its view that amalgamation is required to drive the development of Galway in the context of its regional, national and international remit.  Other key specific recommendations include the caveat that any amalgamation must be preceded by addressing noted deficiencies in both human and financial resources, and a need to strengthen the structure of municipal districts so their full potential is explored and resourced.  Work is under way on this issue in a specific way for Galway and in a general way via the report on municipal governance for districts, towns and local electoral areas, which is with the joint committee at present.  I met on a couple of occasions the Galway Oireachtas Members, and I thank them for that.  A full debate on the proposed merger will be possible when the merger legislation is brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600008#G02200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544100000,"counter":3021,"content":"<p>I have taken the view, both with the Cork and Galway elements, that I defer to my party colleagues in those constituencies, and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire led for us on the Cork end.  I have been speaking at length with my colleagues in Galway city and county councils, who are very concerned, and I want to relay those concerns to the Minister of State and let him know where we stand.  I am being given the impression there is not a great level of enthusiasm or even public engagement in Galway city or county for the merger proposition.  Unlike Cork, where there was a lively and at times heated exchange which led to the majority view that has since emerged in the legislation, I am being given the impression that is not the case in the first instance in Galway.  Notwithstanding the very strong recommendations of the expert group, the public engagement has been limited.<\/p>  <p>  It is also clear there has not been the same level of political majority support for the proposition that was eventually hammered out in Cork.  I appreciate these things are complicated and very difficult but, for example, nobody bar one Deputy came in here to express any fundamental objection to the Cork elements of this Bill, although some had concerns with the detail.  I have met delegations of city and county councillors from Cork, as they met all of the housing spokespeople, and I have a sense of where they were at.  Clearly, the situation in Galway is not at the same stage, and I want to put that on record.  Given all of this, why is it that we have one element of the Galway merger in a Bill that is essentially about Cork, when there will be another Bill about Galway early next year?  It would surely have been better to have it all in the one Bill after reaching at least some degree of majority view of the elected members of those constituencies.  I do not understand the timing and sequencing.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, the issue of finances is central, and the Galway members will be speaking on this at greater length.  If the finances are crucial and if they have not been resolved, it adds even further to the question of why we should be pressing ahead with the Galway element now.  As somebody who is neutral on this, given it is up to the good people of Galway to decide how these things should run, I do not understand it.  Unless the Minister of State gives me very good answers to those questions, I am left in the position of saying this needs to be taken out of the Bill at this stage.  That does not mean I am opposed to or in favour of the merger, but that it would be better to deal with it in a comprehensive Bill.  Otherwise, it gives the impression that it is notwithstanding public disinterest - the Galway Deputies can correct me if I am wrong on that - and political concern in the Opposition that we are pressing ahead with this.  As a Deputy from outside the city and county of Galway who does not know the detail, that is not something I could support at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600009#H00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1544100000,"counter":3022,"content":"<p>I think this proposal is previous.  What guides me in the first place is the report published by the expert group.  The report and the letter accompanying it, and the press release issued by the expert group, were clear that, prior to any decision, it is the underlying money issue, not the money for the merger, particularly in Galway County Council but also in Galway City Council, that should be addressed.  The covering letter states: &quot;It is well recognised by the Expert Advisory Group and local government arrangements in Galway that the funding available to the two local authorities in Galway was inadequate&quot;.  The press release stated that the recommended amalgamation must be preceded by addressing efficiency in both human and financial resources as noted by the group.  The report states:<\/p><blockquote>The Group notes the significant revenue underfunding of the Galway local authorities relative to comparators, in addition to staffing constraints in key areas.  On the basis that the existing resources available to both organisations are not commensurate with realising the vision of an effective amalgamated authority, the Expert Advisory Group recommends that the existing deficiencies in respect of both the human and financial resources be expeditiously resolved as an essential prerequisite to the amalgamation process.<\/blockquote><p>What I keep saying again and again is that we have to sort the underlying money first.  We have had discussions but the discussions related to a small amount of money that was to be given as part of the merger process, which we would have got anyway, even if we were well funded.  It had nothing with regard to dealing with the underlying financial issue that the experts who were appointed by the Department set as a prerequisite and a prelude.<\/p><p>There is a second issue of concern.  This seems like a pre-emptive move to decide that merger is the way forward.  Again, we need to look at what happened in Cork.  I understand the recommendation in Cork was for merger but, when it was looked at in a much wider context by a small expert group, and when all the implications were taken into account, it was decided that there would not be a merger but there would be a boundary extension.<\/p><p>We have submitted a document where we list out the unknowns we need answers to before we could consider this matter further.  Obviously, the first unknown is that we need to have the money on the table but, after that, there are a whole series of other questions on which we need clarification.  Then, we could talk to the public, and to all the interests within the public, from Inishbofin all the way over to Ballinasloe, and from Crusheen on the Galway-Clare border up north, where I live myself, to Dunmore and Glinsk, and all of these areas that are miles away, and then make an informed decision.  These are very practical issues because policy cannot be decided without going in detail through the outworking of how this might work.<\/p><p>I suggest the Minister of State withdraw this section and find some way to interact with the elected members for Galway, that is, the Oireachtas Members but also the local authority members of both the city and county councils, in order to deal with all these issues.  In that way, we will all come to an informed decision as to what is best not only for Galway city, which is very important, but also for all the people living on the offshore islands, right across the county to the plains of east Galway, where the food we eat is produced.<\/p> <p> We need to have this debate first.  It seems to me that the Minister is putting the cart before the horse.  We need to take the horse around from the back and hitch it to the front of the cart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600009#H00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544100600,"counter":3024,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is probably tired of listening to me but I am not going to change my approach.  My approach is based on the fact that I have read all three reports, on my experience as a city councillor for 17 years and on my knowledge that bigger is not better.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is taking one aspect of the report, the recommendation of the proposed amalgamation and ignoring all the other points outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  The city and county councils are underfunded, under-resourced and do not have enough staff.  Notwithstanding all that, there is a very generous acknowledgement that both local authorities work very well together and they share resources.  Nowhere in this documentation does it jump out that the greatest challenge is the fact that we have two local authorities.  What jumps out is lack of staff, lack of money and the serious problems with regard to housing, transport and so on.  This is not the result of having two local authorities but the direct result of a failure on the part of local authorities at one level and a bigger failure on the part of the Government to ensure funding for housing and providing sustainable transport.  These are the important issues in Galway not a diversion in relation to a proposed amalgamation.<\/p><p>The report is not consistent.  It refers to the serious lack of staff and then it states the same staff being united and being an enviable resource to any organisation.  It talks about a condition precedent, which has been clearly articulated by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We need the money and the staff.  The challenge in Galway is money and staff, not amalgamation, but that has not been addressed.  I do not like saying give us the money first, but I would like a recognition by the expert group of a lack of resources and a lack of staff.  That must be dealt with first.<\/p><p>The expert group also talks about increasing the range of services provided by the local authorities, but the Minister of State has not mentioned any of those.  I have just come from the Committee of Public Accounts and over and over we see that amalgamations have lead to significant problems without proper planning.  We articulate what the taxpayer picks up after the event.  The ETB is the latest example of that.  The ETBs in their accounts have highlighted that they do not have enough resources for the internal audit.  Can one imagine that?  They highlight that the computers and the IT is not suitable.  Five years on from the amalgamation, it is a mess.<\/p><p>The local ETB has confirmed that to us and it is no reflection on the staff.  They are struggling with a merger that went through without any planning whatsoever, with no anticipation of what could happen and five years later, we are seeing the direct effects of that at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is costing a lot of money and is burden on the taxpayer.<\/p><p>I will now talk about County Galway.  I worked in Ballinasloe for many years in a different capacity so I am very familiar with the town and its hinterland.  Galway goes from the Aran Islands to Portumna and Ahascragh.  The Aran Islands are Irish speaking while in Inish Boffin, which is further north, they speak English.<\/p><p>It is totally wrong to say we need a city to drive the development of the county.  That is a false concept that is not based on reality.  The initial report of November 2015 stated that from the outset, the committee noticed a distinct lack of vision, planning and resource allocation by key stakeholders in regard to the need to revitalise towns throughout the county.  I have no idea where the committee got that idea.  My colleagues, Deputy<b><\/b>&Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Grealish, have repeatedly talked about the rural areas dying on their feet for lack of investment.  Ballinasloe has a harbour and a railway station and it is going under.  It makes no sense that it should be going under.  It could be a feeder town for Galway with sustainable transport.  The proposed plan would make the situation worse.<\/p><p>Even if I am incorrect, I can see no reason the committee want to go ahead with its plan now.  There is no <i>bona fides<\/i>in what it is proposing to do.  The correct thing would be to bring forward a proper Bill with all the elements that we can discuss and look at.  Well over 90% of all elected Deputies and councillors said &quot;No&quot; to this proposal.  As far as I know, the vast majority engaged in the process.  I certainly did, but was horrified the process was held in a hotel.  I was horrified by the lack of Irish spoken and I was not over impressed by the expertise.  Be that as it may, we now have the reports.  The Minister is ignoring the content of the reports.  I will be pressing my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600010#J00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1544100600,"counter":3025,"content":"<p>I concur with my colleagues, Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Connolly.

I want the Minister of State to give a commitment that he will do that and will listen to the councillors.  They should have a say in this also.  I firmly believe that Galway County Council is being deliberately starved of funds by the Department to force it to agree to a merger.  I am not going to repeat what I said in the D&aacute;il when this was debated.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, said recently that if Galway were to receive the proper level of funding on a par with any local authority, it should be getting an extra &euro;70 million.  We would require an additional &euro;70 million to bring us up to par with other local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Galway is at the bottom of the list in respect of the local property tax.  I have been told it will come up the list in the review but I do not want to be told we will be number five in the review of the property.  I want to know exactly what funding will be put in place.  I do not want to vote for a Bill that I will regret in four or five years' time when I see the results of no proper planning and debate.  That includes the elected representatives in Galway also.  I want to know exactly to the penny what funding will be put in place if this happens without the support of all elected representatives from Galway, both local and national, which I think would be very wrong.  It would be very wrong to railroad this Bill through without the political support of the vast majority of the Oireachtas Members and the county councillors.  If one wants this to work and to merge both city and county and have the two chambers coming together, one needs them to support the Bill, and not be against it.<\/p> <p>I support my colleagues, Deputies Connolly and &Oacute; C&uacute;iv, and the amendment and ask that all reference to Galway is withdrawn from this Bill.  Let the Cork Bill go through.  There is support for the Cork Bill in the Chamber.  I compliment Deputy &Oacute; Broin for listening to us and to our concerns.  He came in here with an open mind.  He has not given a commitment as to what he will do but he has listened to the debate and he will make a decision.  I ask the Minister of State to take Galway out of the Bill.  Let us have a full and proper debate and not appoint a chief executive.  Once that chief executive is appointed for both the city and county, the train will have left the station and will be heading down the railway line and we will not be able to stop it.<\/p> <p> I support Deputies &Oacute; C&uacute;iv and Connolly and all the councillors in Galway who are of the same view.  I have not heard Deputy Rabbitte's contribution yet but I hope she will support us.  I know Deputy Fitzmaurice has great reservations.<\/p> <p> Take Galway out of the Bill.  Let us bring in a new Bill in the new year to deal with the appointment of a new chief executive, with the funding, with the merger and with the issues that go one from one end of the county to the other.  That is all I ask of the Minister of State.  I ask that all Oireachtas Members support us on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600010#J00300","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544101200,"counter":3027,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the Minister of State for his time this afternoon.  I will be brief in my contribution.  I did not speak on this Bill in the Chamber.  However, I attended all the consultations held in Galway.  I do not like to come under the shadow of anybody, and certainly not under the shadow of Cork.  I would like us to have our own entity, to be out on our own and to have a proper debate and discussion.  We owe it to the citizens of Galway, to our elected representatives, namely, the councillors, and to the Oireachtas Members.  Having us included here is not good enough for the people of Galway.  I reject the idea that this should be allowed to happen.<\/p>  <p>   Deputy Grealish has put it correctly.  \"Starved\" is the word we would use in terms of what has happened to Galway.  It has been starved of funding for years.  It is going on since 1996.  We were very fortunate to meet Department officials earlier this year.  They were wonderful in explaining to us the breakdown in terms of where it went wrong.  There were 530 separate accounts all rolled into a number of accounts.  Everything got pulled in together.  The trouble was that when that happened, we saw Mayo take the lead ahead of us and we got left behind.  When one looked at Galway and at Mayo, the only thing that was different was a Taoiseach.  Let us call a spade a spade here.  That was when we started to unravel, and I am not afraid to say it.  We are underfunded, under-resourced and do not have enough staff.  That is what keeps jumping out in the report.  Professor Eoin O'Sullivan did a very comprehensive report.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Grealish is right.  He has never heard me say whether I am for or against the merger, and I will still not say.  I will say that we need to get our ducks in a row.  We need to fund the council and put a proper strategy in place.  I live in Portumna and when this strategy was being drawn up, I asked if they could put us in with North Tipperary because we would be far better off.  Galway is made up of three counties in one.  There is the east, the west and the city.  We are poles apart.  What Deputies &Oacute; C&uacute;iv and Connolly talk about is totally different from what I experience in Portumna, Gort, Athenry and Tuam.  Having us all under the one remit, scares the living dickens out of councillors, such as Ivan Canning in Portumna.  He reckons no money will ever make it to Portumna.  He is probably right.  I am not going to rule that out, however.  I keep saying to the Minister of State that I have an open mind on the whole concept.  Unless I see funding going to councillors and unless we start with the money, I will have a serious reservation on it.  I will doubledown until I see a commitment on money.<\/p>  <p>  My last request is to take Galway out of the Bill and give it its own entity and allow us to have a proper debate in the Chamber.  I want to work with the Minister of State not against him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600011#K00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1544101200,"counter":3028,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I will keep this brief because apart from being a Rossy, there is no point in repeating everything that has said.  However, I represent a Roscommon-Galway constituency.  I agree with everything that has been said by Deputes &Oacute; C&uacute;iv, Connolly, Grealish and Rabbitte.  The reality is that Galway city and county are fantastic.  They have fantastic communities and a fantastic identities.  What has been going on for years is dragging down the city and the county.  Within months of being elected in 2016, the issue of how bad the finances were was brought to my attention by a number of councillors and I attended a number of meetings.  We really need to get this right, as the other speakers have said, and we need a proper discussion.<\/p>  <p>  Ballinalsoe is less than 40 minutes on a motorway from Galway city.  It feels so left out.  We could make this fantastic.  There could be so much more done with Ballinalsoe.  Galway city is bursting at the seams in so many areas and yet one has these great communities who want more in their area.  They are prepared to work for it and with their politicians to make it happen.<\/p>  <p>  I would really like for us to have a proper discussion and not rush this through.

There was no one in support of it.  The city councillors wished to extend the boundary.  The county councillors were, and remain, completely of a different view.  The same goes for Oireachtas Members.  It has been a process that has gone over a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing rushed about this section which talks about the appointment of a joint chief executive.  The process in question in Galway has been going on for about four years.  The process has not been rushed.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge what numerous contributors said about Galway having its own Bill.  Galway should, and will, have its own Bill in the new year.  The 2019 local government Bill will be a reverse of this.  It will be principally about Galway.  There will be other local government matters, including the urban areas committees, if we do not reach agreement on them, contained in it.  Local government Bills tend to be like that.  The reason this section is included is that in the areas where mergers have happened - for example, in Waterford, Limerick and Tipperary - the first thing that happened was the appointment of a joint chief executive.  I will point out that in Galway until the mid-1980s, there was one county or city manager for the two positions.  It is still the case in some local authorities that people are covering two different areas.  In and of itself, having a joint manager is not a merger.  It is, however, a stepping stone on the road towards a merger.  I am not going to deny that.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the chronological order in which questions were asked.  Deputy &Oacute; C&uacute;iv said that the financial resources must be resolved prior to merger and I am not resiling from that at all.  We need to resolve them prior to merger.<\/p> <p>I will go into some detail about extra resources.  The Deputy is correct that a lot would have been provided in the event of a merger.  Following on from the meetings that have taken place with Galway Members and Deputies Darragh O'Brien and &Oacute; Broin, I reiterate that there will be additional funding built in for the county council which historically was the fourth or fifth most underfunded council in the country.  From the start 18 months ago when I was appointed to this position, Galway councillors were lobbying me.  I do not accept for one minute that I have not engaged, although I have not gone to Galway.  Deputy Grealish should note that well in advance of the Galway Bill I will have a full exchange with Galway city and county representatives.  That is the right approach to adopt.  I understand it did not happen in the case of other mergers, but it is actually the right thing to do and I have no problem in doing it.  I have had plenty of engagement with the Oireachtas Members and councillors, formally and informally, in the past 18 months.  I will not be withdrawing the section because what we are dealing with is not the Galway merger <i>per se<\/i>.  It is a stepping stone on the road to it and I am not denying or seeking to move away from it.  I agree absolutely that the issue of finance has to be resolved and that a road map towards permanent resolution has to be in place before the nitty gritty of a merger can be dealt with.<br\/><br\/>I was struck by the Deputy Grealish's comments.  I was not in my current position and was in a position like that of the Deputy when the council mergers happened in other areas.  There is no necessity for the two councils, the two chambers, to merge.  I am familiar with the position in one of the boroughs in London, Richmond upon Thames.

I am not trying to open it up to too much in toing and froing.  If I had been making the mergers when they happened a number of years ago, I believe there would have been a certain logic to having what I am talking about, particularly because of the historical factor.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Grealish raised with me before the position of mayor of Galway city.  I believe we can accommodate it, notwithstanding the fact that there is going to be a plebiscite to have a directly elected head of the local authority.  There is, however, a civic function for the city mayor.  When the Bill is put in place, I hope we will be in a position to fully incorporate it.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Connolly's comments, I do not think I put myself right the other evening.  Although I have lived in a city for six or seven years, I come from a part of Kilkenny with a more sparse population than the wildest part of west Galway.  There are 20,000 acres of State forestry at the back of my home.  It is a really rural place.  Despite the fact that Kilkenny is in the east, people believe it is lovely and has a huge population.  There are parts of every county with a sparse population.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that rural areas do not need cities to survive or develop, but that is not the point I was trying to make yesterday.  The point I was trying to make was that when the local government structure was established under the Local Government Act 1898, the interdependence of Ballinasloe and the area to Clifden was not what it is today.  There were some people from Clifden who might never have been in Ballinasloe.  That was the Ireland of 120 years ago.  It is a fact, notwithstanding that the towns might have been in the one county.  Now the world of business and politics has changed.  I am very familiar with Ballinasloe.  Part of the influence is the change in people&rsquo;s behaviour in terms of retail and employment.  As jobs have moved and people&rsquo;s purchasing has moved out of the town of Ballinasloe, a trend is evident that is seen all over the country, but that does not mean that we cannot have new strategies or development plans for the rejuvenation of towns such as Ballinasloe.  It has happened in other parts.  The deadest town in my county in my lifetime has been Castlecomer.  The coal mines closed in the 1960s.  The late Jim Gibbons delivered mills for textile manufacturing, but they closed about 20 years ago.  There was nothing in the place.  Through a combination of the local authority, private enterprise and a few local leaders, the town of Castlecomer has been completely transformed.  The biggest visitor centre that is not an historical monument in the south east is Castlecomer Discovery Park on the edge of the town.  The physical appearance of the town has been improved greatly with grants from what would have been Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s Department in the past, the Department of Rural and Community Affairs, at which the Minister is Deputy Ring.  We cannot freeze the towns in aspic in the belief that what worked in the past will work in the future.  This is about trying to understand-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600012#L00800","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1544101800,"counter":3042,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has been a little disingenuous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018120600012#L00900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1544101800,"counter":3043,"content":"<p>A number of members have indicated that they wish to contribute again.
