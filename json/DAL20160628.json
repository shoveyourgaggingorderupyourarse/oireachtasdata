Last April, the HSE did an audit, which is with senior management in the HSE.  Console is a well known, well respected and highly regarded national charity which helps families which have lost members through suicide.  It provides a 24-hour phone helpline to anybody who is distressed about themselves or a family member.  It receives a staggering 3,400 phone calls per month, more than 100 per day.  It has offices all over the country and our President is the national patron.<\/p>  <p>  However, people who watched the programme were shocked, stunned and appalled at the allegations of misappropriation of funds.  Console has received &euro;2.5 million from the HSE in recent years to help it provide counselling services.  Almost half its money comes directly from taxpayers through State organisations and the balance is raised through fundraising and donations from the public.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade allocated &euro;130,000 to Console to enable it to support Irish emigrants in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Like all charities, Console depends on the goodwill of people.  Thousands of people do charity walks, cycles and other fundraising activities each year to raise funds for Console.  Yesterday, I listened to restaurant owner Derry Clarke speaking on the radio.  He lost his son and, afterwards, he organised a charity cycle which raised more than &euro;250,000 for Console's good work.  He expressed the genuine hurt he felt about the allegations that were made and how he felt abused by the use of the funds he had raised and donated to Console.  The CEO of Console, Paul Kelly, has since resigned.  He said he had not intentionally done anything wrong.  The Garda is examining the use of the funds, some of which was allegedly spent on trips to conferences in New Zealand for family members.  \"Prime Time\" alleged that the CEO of Console had received payments of over &euro;215,000, which allegedly is in breach of company law and Revenue regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The charities regulator exists to increase public trust and confidence in the management of charities.  Was the regulator aware of the allegations about Console?  They have seemingly been well known to some people for many years.  Did the T&aacute;naiste discuss the revelations with the charities regulator?  Will the charities regulator investigate the matter?  What action is the T&aacute;naiste taking to ensure other charities are being monitored and audited to ensure no such abuse of State funding or people's donations occurs in those areas?  How will the State ensure the abuse of State funding or people's donations to charities is prevented in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800003#A00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1467119100,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It is critical that confidence is maintained in the charities sector and that the members of the public have confidence when they make a donation to fundraising that it will be used properly and appropriately.  Concerns arose about another charity in the recent past and the previous Government ensured a charities regulator was put in place.  It is distressing for people who support an organisation such as Console, which deals with the sensitive issue of suicide and supporting families, that trust has been broken in this way.  I am concerned about the ongoing reports following last week's \"Prime Time\" broadcast.  The HSE audited Console in the recent past, which brought some of the concerns to light.  That demonstrates the robustness of the HSE structure in respect of charities.  The priority for the executive is to ensure the ongoing provision of services and if anything further arises to disrupt them, it will step in.<\/p>  <p>  The Charities Regulatory Authority is in the business of registering and regulating charities.  More than 4,500 charities have registered with it.  I can confirm that the authority and the UK Charities Regulatory Authority are both engaging with Console.  I can also confirm that the authority's chief executive officer, Mr. John Farrelly, has been active on this and he has been in ongoing contact with its trustees and is seeking formal written undertakings from them to assure the authority, via the provision of a report, that the property and the finances of the charity are secure and subject to robust corporate governance, that allegations of financial impropriety will be investigated that a full report on that will be issued to the authority and that they will consent to the authority applying, if required, its powers to assign new trustees to the charity to assist the current board in its work.  It is clear, therefore, that the regulator is playing an active role.  He has also sought reports from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is working with the force.  He has asked RTE for any assistance it can give.  There has been a robust response, as is appropriate, to the allegations that have arisen because it is essential that confidence is maintained in the NGO and charities sectors and the authority is in a position to carry out its functions in this regard.  The Garda may have a separate role if there are other allegations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800004#B00100","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1467119100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We are all agreed about the need for Console to continue its good work and for its reputation and good name not to be damaged but it seems the charities regulator is responding, according to what the Minister said.

He has powers and he should have been in Console's offices long before now dealing with these issues before they came to light publicly.

It is crucial that these investigations be concluded speedily in order that Console and its staff can get on with their good work.

The Taoiseach, during a lengthy contribution, said he regretted that decision and hoped the gains of the past two decades with regard to North-South co-operation were fully protected.  While I welcome his comments in this regard, at no point in his contribution did he acknowledge that the North had voted to remain, nor did the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, excluding one passing comment the purpose of which was to attack Sinn F&eacute;in's demand for a referendum on Irish unity.  Indeed, we had the bizarre situation where a leader of a so-called republican party advocates support for the Scottish Government's position of not being dragged out of the EU but does not support the same position for part of this country that voted to remain.<\/p>  <p>  It is incumbent on the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the Government in the wake of Brexit to respect the wishes of the electorate in the North.  The result of last week's referendum will have huge implications for the island, the peace process, the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the ongoing stability and welfare of communities across the North of Ireland.  There are also very real practical difficulties citizens will face.  Take the case of students from the South attending university in the North.  What about those who travel across the Border frequently for business or who live in Border regions and criss-cross the Border for their social and family life?  What about those who live in the North and work in the South?<\/p>  <p>  The British establishment, who barely mentioned the North during the course of the Brexit campaign, do not understand the seriousness of these issues.  There is now a huge responsibility on the Irish Government to think nationally, and I mean that in the real sense of the word.  I mean 32 county-wide.  It means ensuring full co-operation between the Government and the Northern Executive.  That means working to promote the interests of the whole island and the North in particular in negotiations at EU level.  It means supporting the right of Ministers in the North to deal directly with the EU institutions.  The people of the North have the right to have their voice heard and their vote respected.

We have engaged in contingency planning across all Departments and that will continue.  The Taoiseach gave an outline of some of the issues.  He is attending the Council meeting today and he will also attend the meeting tomorrow.  We have a North-South meeting on Monday where undoubtedly these issues will be further discussed.  I assure the Deputy that the Government will be fully involved in all negotiations to represent Ireland's interests.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the particular points the Deputy made, I note on Monday, 27 June during a debate in the Assembly, a joint position from the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in was put forward by the First Minister in a statement on behalf of herself and the Deputy First Minister.  This emphasised their determination to work together in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland and outlined the establishment of teams in the Northern Ireland civil service to work with Dublin, London and Brussels on dealing with the outcome of the referendum.  This is consistent with the position of the Government which has made clear the priority it attaches to the implications for Northern Ireland in the negotiations which lie ahead.<\/p><p> We underlined the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement in setting out the relationships on and between these islands.

If it is to work strictly off the electoral register, as the polling company has been asked to do, will it include a sizeable number of people who live and have status in this country, who are married to citizens but are not citizens themselves and whose numbers are significant?  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, the eighth amendment also affects non-citizens, given that it affects anyone living in the country.  As one in four of my constituents is from outside Ireland, this is a serious issue.  We must, therefore, have non-citizens in the assembly.<\/p>  <p>  On the same issue, will the Government do something to insulate those in the assembly from pressure from groups?  For example, we all know that there is a history of anti-abortion and other groups lobbying Deputies intensely which are very, let us we say, descriptive in some of the ways they deal with people.

The manner in which any school ensures the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned.  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances, having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes, etc.<\/p>  <p>  The follow-up paper to the report of the forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector, which was published in 2014, outlines good practice and options for promoting diversity in all schools.  The paper gives an overview of different types of arrangements schools have put in place to facilitate those pupils who wish to opt out of religious education.  The paper encourages school authorities to consider their policies and practices and review whether they are taking the steps necessary to welcome all pupils and make them feel included.  I understand that in the case of Catholic schools, the Catholic Schools Partnership subsequently published guidelines for Catholic schools regarding the inclusion of all pupils and that this also contains suggestions on how such schools can manage the opt-out of religious education.<\/p>  <p>  Difficulties could be avoided if, from the outset, a school's arrangements for those students who do not wish to attend religious instruction are made clear to parents.  In that regard, the programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new school admissions legislation taking into account current draft proposals.  The previously published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill included a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  This is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.  It is my intention to retain this measure in the new legislative proposals.  I have commenced a process of consultation and it is my intention to publish a new admissions Bill in the current D&aacute;il session.<\/p>  <p>  A crucial way of dealing with this issue is to provide additional choice to parents.

In most cases the response to people who express a wish that their children do not have religious instruction or do not have a particular type of religious instruction is problematic.  There is no separation of religious instruction in State schools and children whose parents do not want them to participate in religious instruction often sit at the back of the classroom while religion is being taught where they hear and partially participate in the class.  There are no set times during which parents can plan to remove their children from the school and there is no provision for separate supervision.

A great deal is being done in this area.  A Private Members' Bill on this issue will be tabled later and I intend to publish legislation on school admissions.

Parents and students must be able to opt in or out of religious instruction, irrespective of what school the child attends.  The fundamental point is that a direction should be issued requiring schools to separate religious instruction from normal classes, as opposed to integrating it into the curriculum, and to provide it outside core hours.

This has had something of a chequered history.  The project to deliver a new school building was included as part of my Department's six-year capital programme announced in November 2015.  The school is currently located in temporary accommodation.  A potential site option was proposed by the school at an early stage in the process and, following assessment, was deemed to be suitable by the Department.  The Department was willing to acquire this site, and departmental officials engaged in lengthy negotiations with the relevant landowner.  Despite the best efforts of my officials, however, the land acquisition was not concluded due to issues outside the control of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department worked closely since with officials from Meath County Council to identify an alternative permanent site for the school.  A number of site options were identified.  Each was investigated by my Department in conjunction with officials from Meath County Council.  Unfortunately, in the case of all options identified either the land could not be acquired from the landowner or the site was ultimately considered unfeasible to develop.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has since identified a further site which is currently available and has been deemed suitable on technical examination.  My officials have initiated negotiations with the landowner with a view to acquiring this site as a final solution.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that the process has taken considerable time.  In this case, although the Department was willing to acquire a site and despite the resources and time deployed, the process has been protracted and several options have been pursued.

If the Department can identify a suitable site, these powers are available and should be used.  A school - a school such as this in particular - is a central part of the town.  For the entire Church of Ireland community in south Meath, with its church, it is a crucial hub.  We spoke earlier about school admissions and these schools must be protected.

It is of the utmost importance that the Government continue to prioritise that which the previous Government recommenced following our economic difficulties.  The people of Dublin and especially my constituents in Dublin Fingal have been waiting a very long time for the delivery of this critical infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin is the only capital city in Europe without a rail link to the primary national airport.  The precursor to this was not the metro north project of the mid-1990s but the rail link proposed by An Foras Forbartha in 1972; therefore, it has been 44 years in the waiting.  It is very important that the new Government restate its intentions to deliver this project.  Notwithstanding Brexit and the available fiscal space available to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we should perhaps even consider fast-tracking it in some way.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the new metro north service, as approved thus far, will have a journey time of approximately 31 minutes.  Residents in Malahide who are 9.9 miles from the city centre as opposed to 9 miles for residents in Swords can travel that distance in approximately 26 minutes on the railway.  Therefore, for the metro service which will serve more stations and facilitate more people in travelling to and from Dublin Airport and between Swords and the city centre, a journey time of 31 minutes will be acceptable to all.  I had set my own personal target of 35 minutes, which, I am delighted to say, Transport Infrastructure Ireland has beaten by four minutes.<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 census identified Fingal as having population growth four times higher than that in Dublin city.  In the past two censuses Fingal was recognised as the fastest growing youngest environment not just in the Republic of Ireland but in Europe.  Without the timely provision of the metro and the connection to Swords, an emerging city, the airport and the roads would be even more congested.  Figures previously presented by TII suggested approximately 40 additional multi-storey car parks would be required in Dublin city centre alone to accommodate the growth in Dublin in the next ten to 20 years - I believe up to 2035.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad that the new metro north service will have the potential to meet all of the capacity needs of Swords and Dublin Airport into the future.  As the Minister, knows the Dublin Airport Authority is moving towards the delivery of a second runway and growth has now exceeded 25 million passengers on its single runway.  One can imagine with the development in Swords and the airport's second runway, if it proceeds on time, that we will see an increased requirement for capacity in getting people to and from Dublin Airport.  Some 65% of Dublin Airport users get there by bus and given the growth in demographics in Dublin, we need to ensure the users of Dublin Airport are given alternatives to road-based transport.<\/p>  <p>  I was very pleased to have been with the previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, now the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, when he made the announcement at Heuston Station.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, will continue to engage with representatives from Dublin Fingal and the other constituencies along the proposed route in order to ensure the timely provision of this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800025#X00700","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1467129000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue which I know is close to his heart.  He has been a very staunch campaigner on this issue on behalf of the people of his constituency and will continue to be until metro north is completed.  I hope the date for its completion will be earlier than anticipated, but, obviously, I cannot make any promise because it is dependent on the exigencies of the financial situation which is permanently, particularly now, in a state of uncertainty and flux.  I thank him for giving me the opportunity to debate this issue in the House.  It will be regarded as an important debate and will give an indication of the Government's thinking about what will happen in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to proceed with the new metro north project and funding is provided in the Government&rsquo;s capital plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016 to 2021, to facilitate construction of the link, commencing in 2021, with a view to delivery by 2026 or 2027.<\/p>  <p>  It has long been accepted that there is a public transport deficit in the Dublin area generally and the Fingal area on the Swords-airport corridor, in particular.<\/p><p>Fingal is one of the fastest growing areas in the country.  As the Deputy mentioned, the 2011 census recorded Fingal as having close to four times the population growth rate of Dublin city and almost twice the population growth rates of the other council areas in the Dublin region.<\/p> <p> Plans for the original metro north and other major projects had to be deferred in 2011 as a result of the collapse in the economy.  The Government is pleased to be in a position to commence plans to provide a major public transport project along the crucial corridor from Swords and the airport to the city centre.  Following consideration of the Fingal and north Dublin transport study by the National Transport Authority last year and the recommendations of the authority arising from the study, the Government decided that a light rail link running underground from St. Stephen's Green through Ballymun, under the airport and on to Swords would be the optimum long-term public transport solution for this strategically important corridor.  The funding constraints that applied when the capital plan was being developed and which continue to apply mean that we are not in a position to deliver everything required immediately.  Our first priority must be to ensure we maintain the existing transport infrastructure at steady-state levels in order that it remains safe and fit for purpose after the significant period of under-investment during the fiscal crisis.  The funding being provided in the capital plan for public transport investment will see us reach steady-state funding levels by 2020.  In addition, funding is being provided to commence critical transport projects such as the new metro north project to meet growing demand.  As set out in the capital plan, it is expected that construction of the new metro north project will commence in 2021, with a view to delivery by 2026 or 2027.  The estimated cost of the project is approximately &euro;2 billion, excluding VAT.  If additional funding becomes available in the next few years, the project preparations being made will position us to make progress with the project in line with available funding.<\/p> <p> The revised metro north option being progressed is a more affordable version of the original metro north proposal that had been envisaged prior to the economic and fiscal crises.  As such, it should provide greater value for money for the taxpayer.  It is important to note that all of the essential components and benefits of the original scheme are being retained.  I understand the main cost reduction elements will be a reduction in the length of elevated structure as a result of greater surface running in Swords, one fewer city centre station as a result of the replacement of the O&rsquo;Connell Bridge and Parnell Square stations with a single station on O&rsquo;Connell Street, shorter vehicles in line with lower passenger forecasts and smaller stations with shorter platforms to match the reduced length vehicles.  The revised lower cost metro north will be a 16.5 km light rail line, with 8.5 km of the route running in a tunnel from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to Griffith Avenue and under the airport.  It is proposed to have 14 stops on the line - eight above ground and six underground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800025#X00800","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467129600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's response which I had the benefit of reading in advance.

I welcome his reference to the potential availability of further funds to accelerate the delivery of the metro north project.  This may well occur with a little luck.  The Minister hit the nail on the head when he spoke about linking with the spatial and planning strategies.  The sustainable development of the north Dublin corridor is of paramount importance to Dublin City Council and, more appropriately, Fingal County Council which has many greenfield and brownfield sites to develop along the corridor.  If the development goes ahead, the councils will have the ability to provide for a great deal of investment that will be of assistance in terms of job potential and community development in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important to recognise that the delivery of the metro north project is not just about getting people from A to B; it is also about creating communities and giving people in them the links to get from A to B.  There is nothing worse for those living in the communities to which I refer than knowing it will take them 70, 80 or 90 minutes to get to Dublin city centre at peak times.  That is the reality for people living in the north of the county and Swords.  That is how long it takes to traverse the Malahide Road or the Drumcondra and Swords roads if one has to drive, which is the case in many of the examples brought to my office.

I think that is the intention for the future of the project which integrates well with the existing and proposed public transport network of Dublin city.  The National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland have commenced preparatory work on the planning and design of the new metro north project.  A dedicated project steering group has been established.  If additional funding becomes available in the next few years - I am not saying whether it will - the preparatory work being done will position us to make progress with the project in line with the available funding.  I am trying to hold out some hope without making promises.  The Government is committed to providing a metro link on the corridor from the city centre to the airport and Swords.  This is clearly set out in the programme for Government and funding has been allocated for the preliminary planning and design of the project.  It is envisaged that construction will start during the lifetime of the current capital plan, with the metro to become operational by 2026 or 2027.

I am pleased that I will receive a reply from the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, today.  Given that six months have passed since the launch of the new model of care for children with diabetes, I would like to know when the post at University College Hospital Galway will be filled.  The need for the vacant paediatric diabetes specialist position at the hospital to be filled cannot be underestimated.  Children in the region who are encountering serious delays in accessing specialist treatment have to go to Limerick or Dublin to avail of these services.  The families agree with me that it is unacceptable that treatment is not being made available in Galway to children with a particular form of type 1 diabetes that requires them to use an insulin pump.  It is disappointing that even though changes are being made under the new model of care launched last December, this service is still not available, six months on.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State might not be aware that a contract has issued for a person to fill the vacancy I have mentioned.  Believe it or not, the person in question will not take up the post until February or March next year.  When I previously tabled a parliamentary question on this matter, in fairness to it, I received an answer from the hospital in Galway.  I cannot understand why contracts are issued to people who are not in a position to take up the posts to which the contracts apply.  Perhaps the Minister of State might explain the reason to me.  Why do we issue contracts if we do not have the funding to pay for the posts?  It seems that parents have waited for almost five years for this announcement to be made.<\/p><p>Four women attended my clinic in Loughrea recently about this matter.  One woman, from Oranmore, has to attend Limerick University Hospital with her seven-year-old.

One woman is waiting, with bated breath, to get her ten-year-old into the service.   Another woman from Claregalway who has a 14-year old daughter is travelling to Dublin for the service.<\/p> <p> Their concern is that if they have an emergency, the files are not held in the Galway emergency department that they would have to attend.  While they are only 40 minutes from the Galway hospital, their children&rsquo;s files are not held on the campus.

Parents and families face many challenges in caring for their children with diabetes.  I acknowledge that this is not easy.<\/p>  <p>  Galway University Hospital serves as a regional centre for the delivery of diabetes, endocrine and related services to the population of the west.  A consultant paediatrician with a special interest in diabetes has been recognised as a priority post for the hospital.  A consultant has been appointed.  However, the successful candidate is overseas and, owing to prior work commitments, is expected to take up post in March 2017.  While every effort is made to offer the patients an appointment at the hospital as close as possible to where they live, there are instances where local hospitals do not have the necessary capacity.  In this instance, patients are offered care at an alternate hospital in either the public or independent sector.<\/p>  <p>  There is an arrangement in place with Limerick University Hospital whereby all infants and children with newly diagnosed diabetes under five years of age are referred for specialist services.  This will continue until the new postholder starts work.  The Saolta hospital group advises that it is seeking to recruit a locum consultant in the intervening period.

The model proposes to organise paediatric diabetic care around integrated practice units, which will consist of one centre of reference while several additional units will undertake all forms of diabetes care.  Tertiary care and insulin pump therapy will be provided to children of all ages by a multidisciplinary team.  Additional units attached to the centre will support the delivery of services locally acting under the umbrella of these integrated practice units.<\/p>  <p>  Full implementation of the model of care by the HSE will take place over the coming years.

People seem to dream lotto numbers when, as some would see it, they have the good fortune to have a slip on someone else's premises.  Despite all the health and safety, and the measures taken by owners and managers, particularly owners of public establishments, they have seen massive increases of 60% and 70% in their insurance premiums in the last year.  Nobody is talking about this, whereas motor insurance has received a lot of attention.<\/p> <p> People rightly ask questions about the awards.  For example, an award for whiplash is typically &euro;15,000 but, if it happens in England, it is &euro;5,000, or that is what applied before they chose to leave the EU.  I wonder whether the courts have become a bit trigger-happy.  I accept the separation of the Legislature and the Judiciary applies to the apportioning of blame and to who is right and who is wrong.  However, we can legitimately question the amount of the awards as it has nothing to do with the separation of powers.  We should examine how much money is being awarded in the courts and on what basis.<\/p> <p> I want to explore with the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, the possibility of bringing in legislation to rebalance liability and to ensure there is a personal responsibility and an onus on people.  I ask whether this House can do something about the two issues of rebalancing liability and putting a check on the amounts being awarded in the courts, in order to ensure people are not being tempted to pursue claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800027#Z00500","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467130800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Jim Daly for raising this subject, which affords me, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, the opportunity to inform the House of recent developments in this area.  The Minister has asked me to make it perfectly clear at the outset of this debate that the courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law, and are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The conduct of any court case, including the determination of liability between the parties to an action concerning a personal injury, is a matter entirely for the presiding judge and the Minister has no function in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to a number of initiatives in the general area of compensation for personal injury.  The civil liability (amendment) Bill is currently being drafted.  The Department of Justice and Equality has undertaken an intensive policy analysis and consultation process with the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Health, the Office of the Attorney General and the State Claims Agency in the development of these legislative proposals, with the objective of designing legislation which could cover all instances of catastrophic injuries and not just those arising in respect of State defendants.<\/p>  <p>  The components of the proposed legislation are as follows: the court would have the possibility to make periodic payment orders for catastrophically injured plaintiffs who require life-long care and attention; the decision to make a periodic payment order would be at the court&rsquo;s discretion, following consultation with the parties and having considered the needs of the claimant; payments would be indexed to the Irish harmonised index of consumer prices and reviewed at five-yearly intervals; the periodic payment orders could be changed at specified times to accommodate changes in the plaintiff&rsquo;s circumstances, such as the move into full-time education; and the existing limits in the insurance compensation fund would not apply in cases of periodic payment orders and, consequently, where an insurance company became insolvent, the full amount due to a periodic payment order plaintiff would be paid in full from the insurance compensation fund.  Work is progressing well on this Bill and the Minister expects to be in a position to publish the draft Bill in the next session of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 includes provisions relating to the making of regulations for pre-action protocols in cases of clinical negligence actions.  Work has begun in the Department of Justice and Equality on framing these regulations, which are aimed at encouraging timely communications between parties and the early resolution of such actions.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Legal Services Regulation Act also contains a number of measures relating to legal costs, including the following: the establishment of a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator to replace the existing Taxing Master's office; the introduction of new rules relating to the charging of types of fees by legal practitioners and advance notification of costs to their clients; and the introduction of a system of public complaints about all legal practitioners, including complaints as to costs, which are to be dealt with for the first time by an independent statutory authority, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The mediation Bill, which is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person intending to commence legal proceedings to give consideration to using mediation as an alternative means of resolving disputes.  It is intended that this will help to reduce recourse to the courts, as well as the costs and delays which may arise during court proceedings.  The Bill will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of any such proceedings, on its own initiative or at the request of a party to the proceedings, invite the parties to consider mediation as an alternative option and suspend the proceedings to facilitate that process.  The Minister expects to be in a position to publish this long-awaited Bill early in the next session.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Minister understands that the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, met with Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, President of the High Court, on 29 January 2016.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the current review of the book of quantum.  It is understood the Personal Injuries Assessment Board hopes to have the revised book of quantum ready as soon as possible.  It should be noted that the book of quantum is not a recommendation for compensation levels but rather a reflection of the prevailing level of awards, that is, compensation values awarded by the courts, settlements agreed by the insurance industry, settlements agreed by the State Claims Agency and settlements agreed through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, I want to reiterate my opening statement that the determination of liability between the parties to an action concerning a personal injury is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.  The Minister believes that the separation of powers between the State and the Judiciary is a fundamental feature of the judicial system in this country and should remain so.  The Minister has no plans at present to legislate for rebalancing liability between parties to an action concerning a personal injury.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800028#AA00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1467130800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response, although my fears are not allayed much further.  We can all have a hands-off approach and I believe we are overly exercising the hands-off approach because of the separation between the Judiciary and the Legislature, of which I am well aware.  As a House, we have an obligation in this regard.  I am not suggesting for a second that anybody in the House gets involved in apportioning blame and deciding who is responsible for what - that is the job of the Judiciary.  However, the law of the land is set by this House and, therefore, there is an onus on us, the Members of this House.  I ask the Minister to review her approach, which is not to bring in legislation regarding the rebalancing of liability.  It is an issue we should debate in the House.  I believe legislation is necessary and that it would be of assistance to the courts, given we have become a bit trigger-happy, as I said earlier, in regard to the amounts of money that are being awarded.  There is a lot of what many ordinary people on the street would call nonsense happening in the courts, with people making a lot of money out of a little misfortune.  There is an on onus on the House in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In that vein, I respectfully ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, would go back to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to get the answer to three questions.  First, can the sum of awards made in the Irish courts for each of the past five years be provided to me by the Courts Service, if it is possible to get that information, to see whether there is an increasing trend?  Second, what reviews or benchmarking exercises are being undertaken by the Department to compare and contrast the awards in this jurisdiction with other jurisdictions?

The Minister of State may be aware of an ongoing dispute between Childminding Ireland and four IMPACT trade union members in my constituency of Wicklow.  Unfortunately, the situation has escalated since I submitted this Topical Issue matter.<\/p>  <p>  The four members have been on strike since 7 June 2016 but things have moved on slightly since I tabled this matter.  Negotiations have commenced between the union and Childminding Ireland but there are some issues that still need to be raised here.  The dispute arose because compulsory redundancies were notified to staff without prior consultation between Childminding Ireland and the IMPACT members in questions despite the fact that Childminding Ireland is not experiencing any financial difficulties and has produced no business case to justify these losses.  The reason given by Childminding Ireland for these compulsory redundancies is that they are part of restructuring going on within the organisation.  It is unclear to the staff involved why these redundancies are necessary under the restructuring.  The Minister of State might have an update on the matter.  <\/p>  <p>  Four IMPACT trade union members have been on strike since 7 June at Childminding Ireland headquarters in Kilcoole in County Wicklow.  Last week, those IMPACT members handed a letter to the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, in her office in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs asking her to get involved because substantial State funding goes to Childminding Ireland.  Some &euro;360,000 is administered through Pobal to the organisation.  The IMPACT trade union members asked the Minister to get involved to encourage Childminding Ireland to address the issue through the recognised structure - the Workplace Relations Commission.  While Childminding Ireland has entered into talks with IMPACT members in recent days, a conclusion has yet to be reached.  I welcome the talks between the IMPACT members and Childminding Ireland through the WRC and I hope there will be a successful conclusion.  <\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State have some answers to my questions?  Will he clarify if the Minister, Deputy Zappone, used her office to put pressure on Childminding Ireland to engage in the recognised structure - the WRC - which is where this dispute should have been dealt with in the first place?  Will the Minister of State clarify if the Minister, Deputy Zappone, had any contact with IMPACT?  Why was this allowed to continue from when the staff first went on strike on 7 June until last Friday, 24 June, when negotiations commenced?  Three weeks went by before Childminding Ireland began to engage with the relevant bodies.  Will the Minister of State clarify the reason for this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800029#BB00300","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1467131400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady for raising this important matter and giving me an opportunity to respond.  Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation which offers extensive protection to employees.  Those protections include the Protection of Employment Acts 1977 to 2007, which provide for a process of information and consultation between the employer and employee representatives in circumstances where a collective redundancy is proposed.  There is also the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2005 which give employees entitlements to specified notice periods or payment in lieu of such notice.  There is the Payment of Wages Act 1991 which protects outstanding wages, holiday pay, commission and bonuses.  In addition, the Redundancy Payment Acts administered by the Minister for Social Protection provide a minimum statutory redundancy payment.<\/p><p>The WRC, which Deputy Brady mentioned, is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  The WRC customer service section provides information on employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations and how to obtain redress where appropriate.  Staff from the information unit of the WRC are available to meet with staff individually or collectively to discuss their employment rights, including matters related to redundancy.  The WRC customer service section can be contacted at 1890 808090 and the website <i>workplacerelations.ie<\/i>also provides extensive information on employment rights.  It is very important that the WRC provides that information.<\/p><p>The dispute at issue arose from the redundancy of a number of staff members due to the restructuring of the organisation.  The parties are currently engaged with the WRC in an effort to resolve the dispute.  Even the most intractable of disputes are capable of being resolved when both sides engage constructively and in good faith in a voluntary process.  The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour through genuine and constructive negotiations to arrive at a conclusion that is satisfactory to all concerned.  Ireland's system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or in collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanism to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.  I urge both parties to continue this engagement in order to find an acceptable resolution to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800029#BB00400","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1467131400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for outlining what members of the union are acutely aware of.  The union members have been trying to get Childminding Ireland to engage with them through the WRC and that is where the problem has been since the beginning of this industrial action on 7 June 2016.  They are aware of what is there to help resolve the dispute but the problem is that a body that receives &euro;360,000 in State funding blatantly ignored it for three weeks.  These staff members are effectively locked out of their place of employment in Kilcoole.   A body in receipt of substantial State funding failed to engage with the WRC.<\/p>  <p>  I asked two specific questions about whether the Minister who has responsibility, Deputy Zappone, used her influence to exert pressure through her Department on Childminding Ireland to engage with the WRC to end this dispute with the staff members.  It also raises broader issues on child minders.  There are many low paid workers in that type of work and there is a lack of funding from local authorities and Government which has led to this type of dispute.

I think it would be inappropriate for her to interfere in such matters.<\/p>  <p>  While I have no direct role as the Minister of State with responsibility for employment and labour affairs in this matter, the dispute is with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which is actively involved here.  I must tell Deputy Burke that the WRC is the most professional group I have ever encountered here.  We have put in place a world-class system for fast and effective resolution of workplace relations.  I call the WRC a one-stop shop which deals with all disputes and workplace relations.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the WRC also has a role in terms of advising workers of their rights and statutory entitlements and ensuring that the employer is compliant with employment rights legislation.  I believe the dispute is at the right place at the moment with the WRC.  As I said to the Deputy earlier, I encourage all parties to be actively involved.  The Deputy has seen disputes out there that he thinks cannot be resolved, but when it comes down to the talks of the WRC in which everybody is involved, there is reason for compromise and work.<\/p>  <p>  The WRC is independent and we have to let it do its work independently.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on company-specific matters at this stage.  Let us wait and see what the WRC and the parties involved will come up with.

According to Deputy Howlin, it is potentially unconstitutional because the EU Commission has declared, in its opinion, that Ireland does not have an exemption from water charges and has an established practice of recouping the charge for water.  I just wanted to check that it was okay with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that we proceeded.<\/p>  <p>  It brings out the farcical nature of this Bill and of this whole charade by the Government.  If EU law overrides Irish law, as Deputy Howlin is trying to contend, I wonder how seriously the Minister and the Government are going to take the issue of fighting the EU Commission on this.  Or, as I suspect may be the case in nine months' time when the commission that is being set up deliberates, is this designed to take the steam out of the anti-water charges campaign and movement and to look for new ways to try to bludgeon the people into submission, using the EU ruling to do so in the process?  If that is the case, I warn the Minister that under no circumstances are the people who became very exercised and activated on the issue of water charges going to allow that to happen.  The fact that a democratic decision taken by the electorate in February to elect 70% of TDs who made a declaration to oppose and abolish water charges is going to be ignored by the EU Commission says it all about how the EU is behaving lately.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to the Bill itself and to the Minister's speech made on Friday.  The first thing for people who are watching this Bill to note is that this Bill keeps and maintains Irish Water intact.  Irish Water is currently outside the terms of this Bill.  That may be familiar territory to Members in the House, but people outside might be surprised by that.  This is effectively the first broken election promise by Fianna F&aacute;il, which had posters across the length and breadth of the country about abolishing Irish Water and which has instead opted to maintain it.  We could be discussing a Bill now about abolishing and burying Irish Water but we are not.<\/p>  <p>  The second key issue is that the Bill is silent on water metering.  I ask the Minister to agree to amend the Bill and insert a provision to the effect that water metering will be suspended and ended for the duration of the process in this Bill.  By anyone's standards, the idea that metering is taking place in housing estates as we speak, when we in here are debating whether to suspend water charges, is ludicrous.  If the Minister is serious about listening to people, he should agree to amend that in the next Stage of the Bill.  It is a complete and utter waste of money that &euro;500 million is being spent on a metering programme that nobody ever asked for or wanted.<\/p>  <p>  The Government keeps telling us it is serious about conservation.  I draw attention to a section of the Minister's speech from Friday and to the legacy of successive parties - Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats - who were in power for the last number of decades.  I quote the Minister's own words: \"We are guilty of having underinvested in water infrastructure and services for decades\".  It goes on about \"often financially constrained circumstances\".  We were not financially constrained in the 1990s or the 2000s.  I was on a council, as I sure other Members present were, during the period of the biggest building programme in this country.  On Fingal County Council, for example, most of the housing - at least 50% of it - was built during this time.  None of the recommendations of councillors from the left or of environmentally-concerned councillors were taken on board by councillors of Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il.  There could have been a whole raft of water conservation measures in those new homes.  These parties should really stand indicted for their lack of investment.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue in the Minister's speech is an acceptance that there was not enough debate on the previous water services Bill, which is obviously welcome.  There was a clear bias in the Minister's speech when he spoke of those who want water services to be funded by the Exchequer and how they must essentially realise that water in that case is \"competing with hospitals, schools, roads and other services for budgetary allocations\".  There is another option.  Just for a change, the Government could look at taxing the significant amount of wealth and profit of big business in this country.  The Minister and his party consistently say that people on the left who oppose water charges have offered no alternatives.  I am about to offer the Minister at least five of them.<\/p>  <p>  The first alternative is to stop opposing the EU Commission on one issue on which I do support it: the idea that Apple, one of the largest companies on the planet, ought to be pursued by the Government for back taxes it owes this country of an estimated &euro;17 billion to &euro;19 billion.  That is one suggestion.<\/p><p>If we were to do this, we could fund many water pipes.  <\/p> <p> My second suggestion concerns a millionaires' tax on income above &euro;1 million.  It would allow people a fair degree of spending power.  Let us start there.  These are just basic ideas to show where there is wealth.  If we were to impose a 2% tax on all income above &euro;1 million, we could bring in &euro;2.7 billion.  The European Commission has recommended that the Government introduce a financial transactions tax; however, the Government picks and chooses which of the European Commission's recommendations to which it should listens.  It could raise &euro;500 million if it introduced a minimal financial transactions tax, or &euro;1 billion if it was to introduce a more moderate one.<\/p> <p> How about enforcing the headline corporation tax rate at the effective minimum rate?  That would bring in &euro;2 billion this year alone, which would go a long way towards funding the water infrastructure we need.  How about a 10% increase in the effective rate of income tax paid by the top 10% of earners?  Again, it could bring in &euro;2.7 billion.  We could introduce a change in the rate of employers' PRSI towards the EU average.  I am not suggesting we go above it.  It would raise billions of euro every year.  These are just some of the new ways by which we could increase the so-called fiscal space and enlarge the pie significantly in order that we would have money and would not be competing with hospitals, schools and all other services.<\/p> <p> There are other sources of finance in the country which are seldom mentioned.  The Irish Strategic Investment Fund which others and I have highlighted has &euro;5.4 billion in cash which should be used to build houses for the 140,000 families on housing lists.  The National Asset Management Agency has &euro;2.4 billion in cash.  Could we use some of it to fund water infrastructure?  The Irish banks which were bailed out at huge cost by Irish families have &euro;6.5 billion more on deposit than they have given out in loans.  Could we ask them to supply some of it?<\/p> <p> Although there are major sources of funds, the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il have their minds fixed on making ordinary workers and families pay water charges, but there are other ways.  It is often said the Opposition does not propose alternatives.  I have just given approximately six and would love the Minister of State to comment on some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800030#CC00500","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467132600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>In a matter of a weekend and a day a range of issues have come to the fore that will have surprised and not surprised the Irish public.  A very interesting series of attempts to cover up and support each other is happening between the Government and the European Union at the same time as the discussion on Brexit and the question is being asked why ordinary people would vote to leave such a great, kind and democratic institution as the European Union.  For us, it circles around the Bill and water charges.  It is no surprise that we face another suspension.  Fianna F&aacute;il has introduced a great act into the body politic, whereby it will back up the Government, pretend to be in opposition and suspend everything the Government wants to suspend in order to take the heat out of an issue.  It did exactly what the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, desired to do regarding bin charges, which was to avoid more demonstrations and more feet on the street.  The Minister said in the House that we did not need another movement on the streets against bin charges.  The Bill attempts to suspend water charges and kick them into a commission of investigation, not to do what Fianna F&aacute;il promised the people, which was to abolish them.<\/p>  <p>  This has been said many times.  The more interesting issue was teased out in the newspapers, the media and the body politic over the weekend, namely, the revelation that the Government was using the European Commission as a fig leaf to allow it to insist on maintaining Irish Water, threaten the public and push through water charges in some form.  Marian Harkin, MEP, and Lynn Boylan, MEP, have done a great job in exposing, through a series of questions, how the issue was used as a fig leaf.  By following the logic of the questions asked and the answers given, one can see that the Water Framework Directive was introduced by the European Union in 2000 and signed off on by the Irish Government in 2003 to 2004.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission was asked what it saw as \"established practice\" in charging for water.  It stated it depended on what the Government was doing when it adopted the directive in 2003 and 2004.  At the time, our practice was not to charge for water.  In the reply to another question submitted by Marian Harkin, MEP, the European Commission took the view that \"established practice\" referred to the point in 2010 when the Government indicated it would introduce water charges.  The European Union is changing its tune.  In one response it was said \"established practice\" referred to what the position was in 2003, while in another it was said it referred to what the position was in 2010.  This is entirely to suit the agenda of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great relationship between the European Union, Fine Gael and the \"Endapendents\", backed by Fianna F&aacute;il, with the intention of trying to hoodwink and fool the population.  It will not work.  Suspension or no suspension, what has happened here has been another display of outrageous contempt for the democratic will of the people.  All the Government is doing is providing a cover for a corporate agenda, multinationals and regressive charges which put the onus back on ordinary people.  As Deputy Ruth Coppinger pointed out, there are many ways to skin a cat; there are many ways to skin the corporate cat which is getting away with murder.<\/p>  <p>  There is a contradiction in Fine Gael's statements.  When asked about the European Union's possible attempt to force Ireland to increase its corporation tax rate from 12.5%, Brian Hayes, MEP, emphatically responded that if the European Union was to attempt it, we would pull out.  Whether the rest of the party stands over this, it is the statement of the MEP for Dublin on Fine Gael's position on the raising of the corporation tax rate.  Increasing the rate of corporation tax is a spectre, but imposing regressive taxation on the least well-off is not.  The vast majority of people have shown, by putting their feet on the street, voting, being willing to resist bullying and even going to court and prison that they are determined to ensure further austerity will not be imposed on them in the form of water charges.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other ways to pay for water through progressive, not regressive, taxation.  When the Government states it is giving more of the same, we must say it is not fooling the population.  You can fool some of the people some of the time but not all of the people all of the time.  If the Government does not show respect for the dead - water charges must be dead - it must be shown how to respect the dead.  To that end, the population will have to take to the streets again.  The Right2Water movement will meet on Monday with a view to organising further mass demonstrations.  This is in response to the nonsense about whether the EU directive applies to water charges, the contradictory nature of the answers we are receiving and the clear attempt by the European Union to bully the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  One would think the economic bullies of Europe who are trying to force the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership down our throats and privatise everything that moves in the interests of corporate and global multinationals would have learned from what the people of Britain said in response to the question of whether they wanted to remain in or leave the European Union.  They have not learned.  Instead, they are trying to shove more bullying tactics down the throats of ordinary people, but it will not work.  People are wise to them.  There will be more people back on the streets and further opposition and it will come back on Fine Gael and those in this House who made false promises to the people and are reneging on them.  We must totally reject the contents of the Bill and show that we are prepared to resist bullying by the European Union inside and outside the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800031#DD00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1467133200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Connolly.<\/p>  <p>  I questioned what I would say on this Bill because many of us in opposition who support the Right2Water campaign have to question whether we support the legislation because it is a farce.  I do not reckon that the EU is working hand in hand with national governments on these issues, yet five days after the vote for Brexit because of the arrogance and the contempt of the 1% in the EU political class, it issued a statement about Ireland that it would be in breach of the Water Framework Directive because water charges are the established practice in the country.  That arrogance will come back to bite the Union and the Government parties.  When water charges were introduced, I recall a picture of Phil Hogan standing with a smug smile on his face holding a glass of water saying, \"You will pay for water.\"  That is imprinted on the minds of everybody opposed to these charges and austerity.  They said, \"No way, we won't pay.\"  They also said they would not accept them and this was the straw that broke the camel's back.<\/p>  <p>  Then Deputy Alan Kelly brought in legislation a year later saying he had listened to the people and water charges would be reduced, but we pointed out that was not what the people were saying.  They were saying, \"No way, we won't pay.\"  In the general election, the democratic will of the people was to elect more than 90 Members who oppose water charges with a sizeable number of us prepared to vote against the current water charge regime.  Fianna F&aacute;il issued a jingoistic response.  Party candidates clearly stated during the campaign that they opposed water charges and they would oppose them in the Chamber.  They then came up with a half-baked proposal to set up a commission of inquiry to sit for nine months with a report to be sent to the House.  The majority of us oppose this and it will be defeated.  In the meantime, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, stated, \"I think it is up to us in politics to convince people, that there is merit in having a fair, balanced, limited scheme for charging for water ... That achieves the ambition and that reduces waste of water and guarantees we have a stable supply of water.\"  Obviously, that means a stable supply of income coming directly out of people's pockets through a charge.<\/p>  <p>  People have asked whether water charges have been buried.  I have always said they are dead but not buried.  The task other Members and I have is to ensure they are buried over the next period.  I do not know whether it is even worth supporting the commission of inquiry.  What will the terms of reference be?  Who will be on the commission?  If it reports back saying it has convinced the people over nine months through the media that the politicians are right and people have to pay a charge and it has done its job, they will not fall for it.  The people are watching the situation closely and they are checking every nook and cranny.  I held a meeting on bin charges in Ballyfermot last night.  That issue has died down because the Minister did not want the same huge numbers on the streets protesting like they did against water charges.  However, those who attended asked questions about water charges such as what the Commission means by saying Ireland is not exempt from water charges under the Water Framework Directive.<\/p>  <p>  This issue raises a question about the entire European project.  As a country, we have a responsibility to tell the EU we will not implement this directive and we have a different way of doing things.  As has been pointed out in the debate, there are other ways to raise money to fill the fiscal space everybody talks about such as corporate taxation, the Apple issue and the potential bill of between &euro;17 billion and &euro;19 billion, NAMA and credit unions being able to provide funding of between &euro;2 billion and &euro;4 billion for housing and taking the pressure of cutting other services if water services are not paid for.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the House that we have always paid for water services through general taxation and VAT, in particular.  That is the way they have been paid for up to now.  It is progressive as it relates to the amount people earn.  We should return to this.  The Government should tell the Commission that we pay for water a different way, which is the same way we have paid for it since the year dot through VAT.  That is a more progressive way to do this.<\/p>  <p>  Other aspects of the water charges issue could be debated such as how long it has taken to install water meters, the cost of doing so, the jailing of people and the resistance to the programme.  Will the Government stop the water metering programme?  Will it accept the fact that the people have said \"No\" on numerous occasions?  Every time Fine Gael and its partners have come back to the House, they say they have listened to the people but they have not.  They have listened to the 1% in the EU and the 1% in the private water industry who want to grab our water infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Most Independent Members and Sinn F&eacute;in have signed up to the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) Bill 2016, which challenges Article 28 of the Constitution, to keep our water services in public ownership.  That will be introduced during the next D&aacute;il session.  I question whether I will support the commission of inquiry.  I would like more detail about who will be on it and the terms of reference.  There has never been water poverty in this State because people have not been forced to pay for water directly from their wages.  Those who cannot afford to pay are not forced into a position where their water could be cut off.  That cannot happen now anyway because the previous legislation was amended under pressure from the people.  However, that could happen in the future and it has happened in other countries such as the US where people's water is cut off because they cannot pay a water bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Government can get money elsewhere to pay for water services.  That should be done in a progressive way and should be linked to changes in our use of water and to planning and development regulations.  Why does every house that is built not have a dual water system, which uses rain water to flush toilets and run washing machines with clean water only going through taps?  That would be an investment for the next century, never mind the next three or four years.  That issue has been raised on numerous occasions at council meetings throughout the country but such measure has never been implemented.  I question the Government's sincerity on environmental issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800032#EE00100","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1467133200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as ucht an deis cainte ar an &aacute;bhar thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach seo a bheith faighte agam.

I come from Galway city and have a background of having served as a member of a local authority for 17 years and I am acutely aware of the importance of water services, a cryptosporidium crisis and a polluted lake.  As I speak, approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people around Carraroe, in Connemara, cannot drink their water.  I do not speak from a position of negativity or as part of the radical loony left but as a very pragmatic, practical, radical woman who believes that in any civilised society there are basic services that unite us in solidarity with each.  Water is one of those services, as are waste collection services and health and education services.<\/p> <p> It seems that this is a complete pretence and fudge of an issue, and there are more holes in this apparent solution as there are, unfortunately, in our water system that is leaking on a daily basis.  The figures we had in Galway were that there is anything up to 40% leakage from the system.  We have to deal with that but I am afraid that Fianna F&aacute;il has failed and I do not expect Fine Gael to change that.  However, I at least respect its position.  It has repeatedly said that water charges are necessary.  Fianna F&aacute;il told the electorate that they were not and that it would vote to get rid of them.  Rather than use our time and our new energy and the broad range of opinion in this D&aacute;il to find a solution and to work together, we are using our energy on draft legislation that is going nowhere and which will give a watery birth in nine months time that will not be a solution to anything, with the possibility of further extensions if we need them, depending on the political situation.  That is while the metering situation continues against people's wishes.  We do not want it.<\/p> <p> We want to conserve water.  I take exception to the phrase, \"the polluter pays\".  I am tired of that terminology.  I am not a polluter and most people are not polluters; we are users of a basic service that we cannot live without.  To say that we need to be punished in order to save is ridiculous in the extreme.  It does not tie in with any research in psychology or with marketing.  People must be brought on board in terms of this issue and most of us want to be brought on board.  We have children and we want to hand down a better environment to them and the best way to do that is to bring us all on board.<\/p> <p> In terms of education, that should happen with the Government and the European Union, which continue to look on citizens as polluters and users of services rather than as active citizens who want to share in making the world a better place.  If Fianna F&aacute;il was seriously interested in new politics it would stand with us and say, \"Stop this charade and have a referendum to ensure that water remains in public ownership\".  That would give confidence to the people.<\/p> <p> What really highlights the cynicism of the entire approach is the &euro;100 grant that was brought in to help us to conserve water but now it has been scrapped, which shows that it was just a foolish bribe at the time.  However, as can be seen, people are not easily bribed.  Now that it is gone, Fianna F&aacute;il does not care about whether we conserve water.  There is not a word in the legislation about conservation.  There is no reward for us as users, nor is there any positive mechanism to keep us on board.  No money being made available to local authorities to help them.<\/p> <p> I became a member of the local authority in 1999 and left it when I was elected to this House.  During that time we begged the Government for funding.  We knew exactly what was happening.  We had very good staff on the ground whose number have since been reduced.  We had good engineers and other staff but they were all removed.  More than 20% of the local authority staff in Galway was reduced.  How could they carry out any sort of job on water services?  Even within that they gave us an excellent service.  If a problem arose and we called them, they came out immediately.  We now have a situation where we make a telephone call to a service in Cork, which results in us going around in circles.  <\/p> <p> I am not in the business of demonising Irish Water.  I believe the demonisation of the chief executive officer of Irish Water, the former city manger of Galway, was and is unacceptable.  I have had my rows with that man but it is unacceptable to demonise Irish Water and its staff when it was set up to provide a service.  When what was happening was exposed, however, through very good journalism, there were heads on a platter rather than the Government taking stock and saying it should examine this because it is not working.<\/p> <p> Without a doubt, Irish Water was set up with a view to privatising the service.  That privatisation has been stopped in its tracks for the moment but I am not foolish enough to believe we have stopped the tide.  We have done nothing of the sort.  We have simply tried to hold the system to account on behalf of the people who put us in this House.  We promised the people who elected us that we would strive and do our best to ensure people had a water service as a human right, which is what they, and we, deserve, and that it would be paid for out of taxes.<\/p> <p> I have a difficulty with this issue.  While I welcome the suspension of water charges I believe it is the wrong way to go in the sense that we should abolish them and work together to have a service, paid for from taxation, that brings us all on board.  Many ways have been outlined for increasing the level of taxation but it is an insult to the people to say they do not want to pay for services.  They do, but they want to pay for them out of their taxes and it is our role as a D&aacute;il to increase and broaden the tax base to allow us provide basic services.  Dividing one citizen from another, as we have done with health in terms of private and public health care, bin charges in terms of those who can afford to pay them and those who cannot, and repeating the process with water is shocking.<\/p> <p> Those in Government have got caught up with an EU mantra that is foolish in the extreme where we at the lowest level have to comply with rules but those at the highest levels do not.  They are also deliberately misinterpreting a water directive when it could be interpreted in a positive way to conserve water, and to examine how we can do that and how we can bring people on board.  Those in Government and, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, have wasted a golden opportunity and it shows up the cynicism of the new politics that its members have come in here day after day since February to talk about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800032#EE00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467133800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Fitzpatrick who is sharing his time with Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800033#FF00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1467133800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  The amendment to the Water Services Act basically means that there will be a suspension of domestic water charges for the period from 1 April 2016 until 31 December 2016.  This suspension can also be extended if required.  During the last election campaign, I, along with my party colleagues, argued that we must have a system in place to charge for domestic water and wastewater services.  I spoke on the issue of water charges in this House in April and my position has not changed.<\/p>  <p>  A number of people on the opposite side of the House have campaigned exclusively on the issue of water charges.  One would think that the issue of water is the only one that affects the country.  It is not the issue that people who call to my clinic want to talk about.  The real issues I hear raised on the doorsteps include the Government's plans for the health service; finding a solution to the housing crisis; improved funding for the education sector, in particular the Dundalk Institute of Technology; creating new and sustainable jobs; and the impact of the UK leaving the EU.  These are the real issues facing people.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting to note that a survey carried out among voters in this year's general election showed that only 8% of them had indicated water as their main issue.  People have told me that under no circumstances must we ever go back to the boom and bust policies of Fianna F&aacute;il that destroyed this country.  The populist position to take is to reject charging for water and wastewater services.  We have seen in the past week how those who pursue populist policies run from their responsibility when they get the opportunity to act on their policies.  I have no doubt that we would see the same happen here should those be given the opportunity to act on their populist policies.  I would urge people to consider this when they next vote.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to put on record my position should it be decided that water charges are to be abolished.  All people bar none who have paid their water charges should be given a full refund in the event of water charges being abolished.  Under no circumstances should those people be left out of pocket because they legally paid their bills.  The nine-month suspension of the charges is to allow for a process to be set up to examine the charging of water services.<\/p><p>An expert commission is to be established which will make recommendations on a sustainable long-term funding model for the delivery of domestic public and wastewater services.  A special Oireachtas committee will then consider the recommendations and, in turn, the Oireachtas will be asked to vote on them.  At this stage, my concern is that those on the opposite benches know how they are going to vote regardless of any recommendation.  They have their heads stuck in the sand and do not want to see any reasonable alternative to water charges.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I ask all those opposite to provide a viable alternative to a charging system for water and wastewater if they have one.  Simply stating that it is to be paid out of general taxation is not a realistic position.  People are tired of hearing the same old line from those in opposition.  It is now time to put up or shut up.  If a Member has an alternative solution, now is the time to show it to the people who voted for him or her.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> We hear a lot of new politics in this D&aacute;il.  Now, we have an opportunity to see it in action.  I look forward to hearing the views of those on all sides of the House when the recommendations are published.  It will be interesting to see new politics in action then.  What happens if the Commission and the committee both recommend that the current system or something similar should be implemented?  Will those opposite vote for the good of the country or will they vote for their own personal gain?<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Once again, I record my position on water charges.  We should have a system of charging in place that is based on usage with a generous free allowance.  We must encourage those who use the least and discourage those who waste water.  If the House decides that water charges are to be abolished, all those who have been compliant and paid their water charges must get a full refund.  We must not under any circumstances disadvantage those who have been legally compliant.  The bottom line is that the country needs to invest over &euro;1 billion in its public water system just to bring it up to an acceptable standard.  The money has to come from somewhere.  It will not just appear.  I ask those who think water should be free where they think the funding is going to come from.  I look forward to the findings of the expert commission which I hope will provide a way forward for a modern and reliable waste water service.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800033#FF00300","speaker":"1331","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467134400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Over the years, I have had numerous occasions to speak on this and similar subjects in the House.  The debate has always been the same.  It is a question of whether there should be a charge for domestic water supplies.  I believe there should be a recognition that an investment is needed in the development of the water supply system far beyond anything that has been envisaged over the past 30 years.  I have put down numerous parliamentary questions to various Governments and Ministers over the years inquiring as to the proposals to provide the capital funding for the provision of adequate water supply, storage, treatment and transmission services.  It is now recognised that the costs are laid out more or less as had been indicated in the past number of years at somewhere between &euro;5 billion and &euro;8 billion although it could be more if we were to have a reliable water supply similar to that which is available in other countries throughout the EU, which gets the blame for a lot of things.<\/p>  <p>  I can remember when our water supply was comparable to most others in the western world.  When one went on holidays to neighbouring countries one was always very careful about the water supply.  That has changed because they have invested in their water supplies while we have not.  It is one thing to curtail the quality of water, but it is quite another to curtail the quality of water by virtue of a lack of investment and to put lives at risk.  We have had the situation in this country over the past number of years where rivers and lakes were polluted to an appalling extent while at the same time we had people saying we could certainly not have any charge for water.  We cannot have any recognition that water requires an investment and we will do as we did before by going on and ignoring it.  It does not work that way.<\/p>  <p>  The demand from industry as well as from the domestic market are such that a failure to respond in a clear and emphatic way to the investment requirements of our water supply system will mean our industrial activities will be curtailed dramatically.  It will not be possible to provide the water services required for an expanding economy, it will not be possible to expand the water services required for industry and it will not be possible to do it for an expanding population.  Taking all of that into account, there is a need for massive investment along the lines already identified.  Where that is going to be funded from is the next question.  It will not be possible to fund capital expenditure of that magnitude from a domestic charge.  Neither should it be expected to be hived over to the industrial sector because we either want jobs or we do not.  If we want to kill off economic growth, the way to do it is to pile as much taxation on the job creating sector, on each person who is at work and on each employer, as possible.  Eventually, we will not need a water supply because nobody will be at work.  The position is clear.<\/p>  <p>  We must recognise that a charge of some description is necessary to recognise the fact that water is not free.  This question has come up again and again.  We are told water is free because it comes down from the clouds and we should know all about that in this country as it comes down often enough.  However, it has never been free.  I remember when everybody went to the village square with a bucket and turned a handle.  This is not so many years ago.  In every square in every town, there was a pump and one got the water and brought it home.  It was free in that no one can impede a person from gaining access to a water supply albeit one might have to go to the river with a bucket.  However, time passed and we became more sophisticated.  We provided a water supply to households.  It then emerged that it would cost more money and we would have to do something about it.  That was done too.  Incidentally, I can remember a time when it was suggested at an election that we would not have to pay rates.  There was a figure in the old rates system in respect of water.  It was a nominal sum but it was there.  Somebody decided to abolish rates.  I will not say who it was.  I cannot remember.  My memory does not go back that far.  It happened, however, and motor tax was abolished at the same time.  The next thing that happened was that the country went bust and we had to reintroduce the whole thing all over again because there was no money in the kitty.  People asked why we did not fill the potholes or provide water or do all the other things we were supposed to.  The answer was that there was no money.  It all had to be changed over again.<\/p>  <p>  As such, when people say it is all provided for in general taxation, I note that it was not.  I put down a parliamentary question to a previous Government asking to what extent the water costs had been transferred to general taxation and the answer was that they had not been.  There one is.  I am not saying the Minister of the time was telling a lie because I know that Ministers never do that.  Certainly, the Minister at the time did not tell a lie.  He was giving the information as he was asked as to whether it was provided for in general taxation and he said \"No\".<\/p>  <p>  We are now back where we started asking how we fund and provide a service in the future or if we do it at all.  If we fail to do it, we will have run away from our responsibilities and at some stage in the future, somebody will pass judgment on what we have been doing.  The EU has been blamed.  I was listening to Mr. Nigel Farage this morning.  I do not like to speak about those who are outside the House who cannot speak for themselves, but he had a long list of proposals for the future admonishing the European Union, despite the fact that he has been a representative in the European Parliament for a number of years.  One of them was tariffs on trade which is to say isolationism.  That will be very interesting in the future because we will not be able to sell our goods and they will not be able to sell theirs.  Everybody will put up the barriers and eventually things will come to a halt.  That did not work in the past and we changed it.  Other people have ideas about the system in eastern Europe 35 years ago or more where the theory was that everybody piled everything into the grand pool and everybody drew from it as time went by.  Of course, that system went bust.<\/p><p>No one wants to accept responsibility for everyone else's problems.  Things do not work that way.<\/p> <p> Regardless of whether we like it, the question we must now ask is whether a nominal charge for a water supply is good.  My view is that it is, as it reminds everyone that we should conserve.  Conservation must be a major issue in the debate.  Whatever the outcome, we must ask what is in the best interests of those people and industries that require an ongoing supply of water and what is the responsibility of publicly elected representatives whose job it is to provide others with that service.  It will not be enough to fudge the issue and say that someone else will have the responsibility to do it, that they will not see it at all because it will be a general issue and that they will tax X, Y and Z because they will not accept responsibility.  We must accept responsibility.  I favour the concept of either a flat charge for a basic service or a waiver system, which we had previously and which would take families' circumstances into account.  There is no objection to that.<\/p> <p> The danger is that, once an issue becomes a political football, it will eventually be kicked to death and nothing will happen.  Consider our current scenario.  A candidate in a by-election decided that he would oppose water charges, full stop.  Subsequently, a party in this House made the same decision, followed by another party.  Not every party agreed at the same time.  Unfortunately, democracy does not work like that.  It would be nice if it did.  If this becomes a political football, we could well find the same question still hanging over our heads in ten years' time as to how to fund a water supply that is sufficient to meet our domestic and industrial needs as well as increased expectations and demands.<\/p> <p> At this point, we must ask ourselves what we are about.  It is not just enough to blame the EU.  The EU does not impose anything.  It imposes what was agreed by the member states making their individual contributions.  That is the sum total of what comes out of the EU by way of directive.  There is no use in pretending that it is not.  That is how it has always been.  Something might have been agreed last year, five years ago or ten years ago.<\/p> <p> In the final analysis, we must invest in the water supply.  We have a duty to the Irish people to ensure that this is done.  We must put in place a system that is reliable and will not break down every five minutes.  We must renew the existing system.  There is no use in people complaining about pipes being porous and leaking water all over the place while also complaining about the expenditure.  We must do something about it.  If we are to do that, we must start somewhere.<\/p> <p> I wish to comment on general taxation.  Many of us received e-mails and requests before the general election to the effect that motor tax should have been abolished or attached to general taxation or energy tax.  That sounds good and some countries have done that.  Maybe it suits them.  Maybe they get or generate their energy in a different way.  However, we tried that as well and it did not work.  There was resistance when the alternative was introduced.  As they say, that is politics.<\/p> <p> Regarding investment in water, how to regulate it, how and whether to charge for it and whether to install meters, it has adequately been proven in my time in the House that meters are necessary.  If there is any possibility of conserving water, that is how it will be done.  People will automatically know that they must conserve because water will cost more past a certain level.  It will be in everyone's interests to conserve.  People will say that we should meter afterwards, but that is not how things work.  We must put the infrastructure in place before we can develop it.<\/p> <p> In so far as taxation is concerned, we must undoubtedly find a way to invest.  The major capital investment that is required cannot come from domestic users.  The amount would be too great.  It could have been done 25 or 30 years ago, but it is too late now.  In my dealings with domestic householders, they do not mind paying a fee as long as they get a good quality of supply.  Deputies who represent parts of the country that depend on group schemes and so on will point out that the people there have been paying for their water supplies all of their lives.  Some have been paying up to &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 per annum, which is a considerable amount.<\/p> <p> One way or another, we need a greater recognition of the fact that we must find a way to cease polluting, improve the quality and reliability of supply, resolve the antipathy that has been generated towards a charge for water and find an acceptable mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800034#GG00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467135000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>The next three Deputies are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800035#HH00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1467135000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy O'Rourke and the Acting Chairman once we manoeuvre the situation with the Chair.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this debate.  I am pleased to support the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2016.  It sets out a route to end the water charges regime.  The failure to pass the EUROSTAT test and the low payment rates have undermined the basis of our water services model.  Water charges failed in 2015, with only 53% of bills being paid, equating to an annual revenue of approximately &euro;144 million.  Last year, the water conservation grant cost approximately &euro;100 million.  There was an administration charge of &euro;25 million and interest on repayments of a further &euro;41 million.  Expenditure was in the region of &euro;166 million against income of &euro;144 million, generating a loss.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill reflects Fianna F&aacute;il's agreement in facilitating a Fine Gael-led minority Government to see water charges suspended immediately and the decision on future charges to be decided by the D&aacute;il.  The Bill is a compromise.  Members from all sides entered the election with their manifestos and policy positions on water and water charges.  The Minister and his party did not win the election.  Neither did we.  We have different views on what should be done with water charges and Irish Water.  It became clear that the dynamic of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il was somewhat different than that of the Thirty-first, with a majority of Members favouring the abolition of the charges and many favouring the abolition of Irish Water.  It is clear from listening to other Deputies' contributions that, despite having an electoral mandate and this being one of their policy positions, they failed to engage in the process.  The Bill is a compromise, but it gives effect to what we set out to do.  We did not win the election and we are not in government, but this was a key component of our campaign.  While the Bill retains Irish Water, it suspends the conservation grant and establishes the legislation to suspend the charges.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Durkan asked what the long-term funding models for the delivery of water would be, but that is the point of establishing the expert commission.  We are not walking away from the issue.  This is not an irresponsible Bill.  We understand Deputy Durkan's points about the need for future investment in water services.<\/p><p>It is part of a programme.  Suspending the charges affords a window of opportunity, or timeframe, for Members of the House to engage, first through the expert commission and then through a committee of the House.  The matter will be brought back to the D&aacute;il within nine months, which I welcome.  I am disappointed that not all Members engaged in the process to establish the programme.  The vast majority of Members were of the view that the charges should be suspended.<br\/><br\/>I do not want to repeat many of the points made, but I must state we sometimes forget very quickly that is only a little over two years since the issue first arose.  In October 2013, wintertime, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>stated:<\/p><blockquote>Dublin City Council said supplies could be cut off today from 6pm until 7am &ndash; two hours longer than yesterday &ndash; and that restrictions will remain until Monday.  The shut-off comes during a busy mid-term week when Dublin is bustling with tourists and Halloween revellers...<\/blockquote><p>The article quotes the city engineer as saying: &quot;The problem is that the lake water is proving very difficult to treat &ndash; not because it's bad, but because of the characteristics of the water.&quot;  He also stated: &quot;Normally, Ballymore Eustace is a stable environment because it's a big, deep lake.&quot;<br\/><br\/>In Dublin the water supply is on a knife edge; there is a fine balance.  At any given time, our usage is near capacity and there are not many spare resources.  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan touched briefly on future economic and residential development, in respect of which there is a problem.  It struck me that a conservation grant was given to households last year.  If that money which amounted to a sum in the region of &euro;100 million had been invested directly in repairing leaks or improving capacity, it might have had a far greater output in terms of the water supply in the Dublin area.<br\/><br\/>With regard to metering, much of the leakage occurs not necessarily in private properties but from main pipes along roads.  Neighbourhood and block metering, which helps local authorities to identify leaks in areas, needs to be established and implemented in order that leaks can be identified quickly.<br\/><br\/>In June 2012 the Oireachtas committee produced a report.  At the time the Minister's Department was stating 41% of water nationally was lost through leakages.  I believe it used the expression &quot;unaccounted for&quot;, which meant loss through leakages.  From 2000 to 2010, my party in government invested in the region of &euro;500 million per year in water services.  Much of the investment was in sewage treatment services and to improve water quality.  Of equal importance, particularly in the Dublin context, where the supply side is under significant pressure, is ensuring a significant investment programme to fix leaking pipes to reduce the rate of water leakage substantially.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased that the Bill is before the House.  I will be very interested in seeing and working with the findings and recommendations of the commission and the Oireachtas committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800035#HH00300","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467135600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on this topic.  The current water charges system has failed.  It has failed because, when considered in the context of overall taxation policy, it has failed the fairness test.  Like many other policies the Fine Gael&ndash;Labour Party Government implemented when correcting the public finances or sharing financial gains, its policy in this regard was to prioritise the well-off instead of the less well-off.  All of its budgets were adjudicated on by the ESRI as being regressive in nature, as distinct from the fairer progressive approach needed.  The ESRI's report on budget 2015 which confirmed Social Justice Ireland's analysis of that budget stated it had been the fourth regressive budget in a row introduced by the Fine Gael&ndash;Labour Party Government and a budget that widened the gap between rich and poor.  The ESRI's analysis of the previous year's budget, budget 2014, showed that it had had its greatest impact - a reduction of 2% - on low-income groups.<\/p>  <p>  For taxation measures to be accepted by the people, they must be fair, but the way in which the Fine Gael&ndash;Labour Party Government went about implementing the water charges regime lacked fairness.  A quick analysis of the income and expenditure figures for water charges demonstrates what a total fiasco the former Government made of the implementation of the charges regime.  Let us consider last year's figures.  In 2015 only 53% of water bills were paid.  This level of payment secured annual revenue to the State of &euro;144 million.  However, &euro;100 million was spent by the Government on the water grant which was promoted as some kind of a water conservation incentive.  However, this payment was not linked with any conservation measure; it was only to get the people to pay their water charges.  It was an indirect admission by the Government that its approach to water charges had failed.  In 2015, &euro;41 million was due in interest repayments over the year, while another &euro;25 million was paid in administration costs.  On this basis, taking costs and revenue into account, the State actually lost &euro;22 million in total on its water charges regime in 2015.  Some &euro;46 million a year is being spent on wages in Irish Water, while more will be spent on bonuses.  This is on top of the &euro;172 million in set-up costs.  I am not aware of any other tax introduced in recent memory in the collection of which money was lost.  We need to end this failed regime and move on from this issue.<\/p>  <p>  When all costs are factored in, namely, the &euro;540 million spent on water meters, the &euro;172 million spent in the setting up of Irish Water and the &euro;46 million spent in running it and paying wages and bonuses, the Government's creation of Irish Water will leave the taxpayer &euro;759 million worse off this year than if it had not been set up.  Taking this in the context of the local authorities already having in place many specialised and dedicated staff dealing with water-related issues, was there a need to create such a monster as Irish Water?  The staff in local authorities are carrying out the works at the request of Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  One of the reasons for setting up Irish Water was related to its ability to borrow money off balance sheet.  Private borrowing by Irish Water is now effectively impossible owing to its growing reliance on Government payments.  It will be more expensive for Irish Water to borrow on the markets than the Government.  Why would we set up this body, facilitate it to borrow money at more expensive rates than are available to the Government and then effectively ask the people to meet the increased cost of borrowing through their water charges?<\/p>  <p>  Water charges were introduced following the introduction of the universal social charge, the property tax and the removal of many social protection benefits, including benefits that were taken from older people.  When the Fine Gael&ndash;Labour Party Government made a decision to adjust universal social charge levels in its last budget, it decided to reward the well-off disproportionately, which was another example of its regressive and unfair approach to taxation policies.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will introduce further amendments to the Bill to ensure the suspension period runs in tandem with the timeframe for the work of the expert commission and the Oireachtas on the issue.  Our support for the Bill is subject to this happening.  No new bills will be liable for payment until the end of March 2017, by which time the D&aacute;il is due to have voted on the future of water charges having considered the expert commission&rsquo;s report and the recommendations of the special Oireachtas committee.  In effect, water charges are gone until the D&aacute;il votes on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  In the European Parliament in September 2015 Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs voted in favour of \"providing for the application of a progressive charge that is proportional to the amount of water used\",  It is clear that the official Sinn F&eacute;in position on this issue abroad is quite different from that at home.  From 2007 to 2011 the then Northern Ireland Minister for Regional Development, Mr. Conor Murphy of Sinn F&eacute;in, had the opportunity to reverse the policy on water metering, but he made no attempt to do so.  Under his watch, a comprehensive water metering programme took place across domestic properties in Northern Ireland.  In the recent Brexit referendum campaign I watched with interest as Sinn F&eacute;in campaigned for a \"Remain\" vote.  In every EU referendum that took place in this jurisdiction in recent memory it campaigned against the European Union.  Which is the real Sinn F&eacute;in?  Again, we find its approach is completely inconsistent.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland faces a range of issues, not simply the argument on water charges.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is obliged to confront these matters.  The health service, housing, the future of education, including special needs education, supports for older people and crime prevention all require a major political commitment.  We need to resolve the water charges issue and move on and the Bill gives us an opportunity to do so.  It gives us a window of opportunity to end water charges, solve the problem of Irish Water and move on to the serious political issues, while still enabling stable government at a time when stable government is most needed.  The Bill reflects the first part of the Fianna F&aacute;il agreement in facilitating a minority Government that will see water charges immediately suspended and their future decided by the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800036#JJ00200","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1467135600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill and commend my colleagues who participated in the talks on the formation of a Government and negotiated to ensure the Bill would form part of the Fianna F&aacute;il agreement to facilitate a minority Government.<\/p><p>I represent a constituency that is divided on water charges.  In one part, albeit one that is not restricted geographically, significant resistance to the water metering programme continues, while in another part, the programme did not meet such resistance and was greeted with enthusiasm by some.<\/p> <p> Speaking previously on this issue, I noted how the establishment of Irish Water had the potential to be a ground-breaking development on a par with the establishment of the ESB.  As I pointed out at the time, however, Irish Water's destiny was sealed from the moment it was established, accommodated by a guillotined debate in this Chamber when elected Members were denied an opportunity to discuss amendments or engage in any serious worthwhile debate.  The previous Government then engaged in perhaps a dozen U-turns and the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, threatened to punish non-payers by reducing their water supply to a trickle.<\/p> <p> It could have been so different.  The speed with which the previous coalition moved to shoehorn this utility into existence raised deep suspicions among members of the pubic about the possibility of water services being privatised.  This, with the fact that thousands of people, many of whom are vulnerable and rely on State assistance and entitlements, simply could not afford to pay, deeply angered people.  This anger was felt not only by traditionally vulnerable people but also by public servants, garda&iacute;, nurses and teachers, all of whom had been put to the pin of their collar and baulked at the level of charges being suggested in reports.<\/p> <p> The failure of Irish Water was not solely because people did not want to pay.  There was a failure to win public confidence and secure moral public investment in the utility through a lead-in time of between three and five years.  The company also failed to secure the confidence of the most committed supporters of water conservation and metering who envisaged a smart, flexible and responsive system that would genuinely reward efforts at conservation.  Instead, everyone who wanted one got a conservation grant for doing nothing.<\/p> <p> The previous Government insulted people's intelligence.  The Minister spoke recently about the need for education in the context of pay-by-weight bin charges.  A university business faculty somewhere must be designing a course on how not to build a commercial state utility using Irish Water as an example.  Thanks to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party's willingness to facilitate the formation of a Government, the challenge we face is to move forward and take the necessary steps to correct the mistakes made.<\/p> <p> As I said, however, it could have been so different.  The previous Government could have embarked on a prolonged education campaign, beginning in primary schools and evolving into post-primary and community education.  Instead, schoolchildren protested with their parents at marches and wrote the right to water principle into their 2016 proclamations.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources could have embarked on a detailed, dynamic communications strategy informing the public over time of the finite nature of the natural resource that is water.  The previous Government could have worked in tandem with the State broadcaster and encouraged it to play its part in producing balanced documentaries about the importance of water conservation and international best practice.  It could have invested over time in the science of water conservation, encouraging research into water conservation measures.  As I pointed out in a previous contribution, the state of Massachusetts in the United States has introduced new building regulations that oblige builders to ensure hot water flows within 12 seconds of the tap being turned on.  The previous Government could have used the opportunity to design a smart metering programme that enabled consumers to monitor their water use, thereby empowering them in terms of usage.  It could have explored additional water harvesting technology for domestic use and examined further building regulations that could have assisted reduction in domestic water use.  The previous Government could have designed an intelligent programme but did not do so and, in its haste, squandered a major opportunity to do something great for at least a generation.  Instead, it designed, at mesmerising speed, a model that appeared to envisage Irish Water being fattened up for privatisation.  It then promised to punish citizens who would not pay, the majority of whom could not pay.<\/p> <p> The previous Government lost its mandate on water charges at the general election.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party made a commitment to the electorate and this Bill is the first step in achieving it.  We have outlined a clear pathway for realising this commitment, and the majority of Members of this D&aacute;il will decide on the future of water charges following the report of the expert commission and Oireachtas committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800036#JJ00300","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467136200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I take issue with Deputy John Lahart's remarks that the previous Government lost its mandate on Irish Water.  All parties have agreed that the RTE exit poll taken on the day of the previous general election was highly accurate.  The poll found that 5% of those who gave the Fianna F&aacute;il Party their first preference voted on the issue of water.  If one were to analyse the specific rationale behind the decision of individual voters to vote for particular candidates, the water factor would be unquantifiable.  There is no validity, therefore, in the argument that the majority of Members of the D&aacute;il elected in February oppose water charges or that they were elected to abolish Irish Water.  It is impossible to determine whether this is the case and I do not believe the extreme left on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I will not defend the actions of the previous Government, of which I was not a member.  It is clear that the construct of Irish Water was flawed in terms of gaining public acceptance.  As a Fine Gael Party Deputy in the previous D&aacute;il, I was unhappy with certain issues related to Irish Water.  Just before the previous Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, changed an element of the water charging regime, I voiced my concerns in an interview with RTE, as did many other Deputies on the day in question.  The very next day the Cabinet took the welcome decision to change its position. <\/p>  <p>  The bottom line with regard to the outcome of the general election is that the previous Government made mistakes on a multitude of issues, including Irish Water.  We are human and the mistakes that Government made cost the careers of dozens of Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies.  I have a major problem with the concept that because the majority of Deputies in the previous D&aacute;il passed an unpopular law introducing water charges based on commitments given by Deputy John Lahart's party in the preceding D&aacute;il, we must completely undo and fundamentally change the manner in which a public service utility is structured and funded.  There is something inherently wrong with that proposition.<\/p>  <p>  I take a principled position on water charges.  Since 2009, charging for domestic water use has been a Fine Gael Party policy which I signed up to in 2009 at local elections when I was re-elected as a councillor, again in 2011, when I was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and in 2016 when I was re-elected to the D&aacute;il.  While I have no desire to see water charges removed, I accept that the establishment of a commission examining the structure of Irish Water and the charges it applies is a good thing.  It is a pity the political cost of the ongoing fallout from the introduction of water charges has been a debate involving the suspension of water charges.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will meet Commissioner Vella next week.<\/p><p>I have no wish to speak for the Minister, but I imagine the question he will be asking is whether we could be fined, potentially, for our suspension of water charges, because Article 9.4 of the Water Framework Directive applies and the derogation does not apply.  Are we going to be fined?<\/p> <p> The cost could be similar to the figure Ireland was fined for turf cutting.  I understand that figure was &euro;25,000 per day.  If so, it would cost the State approximately &euro;10 million over the course of a year or &euro;7.5 million if it was for nine months.  I doubt that will be the case and imagine it would be for 12 months.  That is a total of &euro;10 million that we could be spending on water services.<\/p> <p> I offer some examples.  A gentleman who worked for Dublin City Council and Dublin Corporation for 40 years was in my office recently.  He was a very nice man.  He worked in water services provision for the city council, as well as Fingal and South Dublin county councils at various stages.  He referenced the Vartry tunnel in Dublin which supplies approximately 340,000 customers.  It is 150 years old but does not have a brick or any cement in it.  It is a natural bored hole, literally cut out of the rock, muck and everything else around it underground.  It is in danger of collapse.  Irish Water and Dublin City Council, on its behalf, must service the tunnel.  Those involved have to shut off the water and crawl up a hole in the ground.  If there is a collapse, they have to shut off the water and literally crawl up a hole in the ground to try to find it.  In 2016 that is a perverse state of affairs.  I have seen a report on it.  It was provided to me by the gentleman I referred to.  The report is on the record of and was debated by Dublin City Council many years ago.  The report identified the requirement to fix the tunnel but nothing happened.  We have had 50 years of complete and abject failure of successive Governments to invest in water infrastructure, yet the moment we instigate a charging regime that, I hope, was to normalise the investment process, we suspend it for political expediency purposes.<\/p> <p> Dublin operates at 98% capacity.  We are not having a drought now but if we had a drought in the summer months for a couple of weeks at most, and Dublin's supply from County Wicklow and elsewhere and Fingal's supply from Leixlip and elsewhere dried up then potentially hundreds of thousands of customers would be either throttled, that is to say, there would be a reduction in water pressure, or shut off.  Hundreds of thousands of people would be affected.  Most of our European counterparts operate on a 15% capacity.  In other words, they are operating at 85% and have 15% headroom for such eventualities.  We do not.  We have 2% headroom.<\/p> <p> There are 16 locations throughout the country where, if a person flushes the toilet, the wastewater goes directly out to sea untreated.  Two of these are in my constituency in the vicinity of Rush.  On three occasions in the past month alone, four beaches in my constituency were closed on the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency on the basis of toilets overflowing and wastewater from treatment facilities ending up in the Irish Sea.<\/p> <p> The D&aacute;il arithmetic requires us to adopt a resourceful position.  I say as much because if we had not adopted this position, we probably would not have a government.  Furthermore, even if we had, a democratic vote of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann would abolish Irish Water outright as well as the charges.  That would be the end of that.  Instead, an opportunity has been provided to us with Fianna F&aacute;il support, which is appreciated, for the purposes of discussing this matter to ensure that we get it right this time.  That is good.  I remind the Deputies opposite of an RTE exit poll.  It is available and people can download and assess it.  According to the poll, only 5% of voters voted for Fianna F&aacute;il based on the issue of water.<\/p> <p> I wish to touch on the Water Framework Directive and Article 9.4 in particular.  The Commission has given a rather unambiguous response.  The so-called Irish derogation would no longer be an option.  Having come off RTE \"Drivetime\" and a discussion with Deputy Paul Murphy, I imagine the response will not put an end to the debate on the derogation.  The bottom line is that the European Commission has said that the derogation no longer applies and that we are not in a position to abolish water charges without consequences.  I hope this hastens the debate in terms of ensuring that we have a reasonable and rational discussion about a reasonable level of funding and Ireland being the only country in the EU or the OECD that does not have water charges or that did not have water charges heretofore.<\/p> <p> I was in the Chair when Deputy Ruth Coppinger took to her feet earlier.  She said this Bill was unconstitutional because it went against the EU Water Framework Directive.  That puzzled me and, I imagine, anyone with who has read the Ladybird book on the law.  The bottom line is that we have a law in place and an opportunity to ensure we frame it correctly in terms of a reduction of taxation for our constituencies and citizens throughout the State.  Moreover, we must ensure that the polluter pays, which was the principle adopted with the Water Framework Directive in 2003.  The directive set out that by 2010 all EU member states would agree their position on a charging regime.  We had a derogation because we did not have such a regime, but we do now.<\/p> <p> It is interesting that the Department submitted its first river basin management plan in 2010 without reference to the derogation.  I was a Member at the time the debate took place on the question in 2012.  The Commission published a report on the Water Framework Directive and Ireland.  I remember the arguments in the House and the briefing notes on the fact that there no longer was a derogation.  I recall the debate centred around whether it had been signed away as part of the bailout.  I believe it was.<\/p> <p> We have had 840,000 meters installed throughout the State.  What an extraordinary waste of public resources it would be if we were to abolish Irish Water and water charges at the end of this process.  Getting rid of 75% of the Irish Water's phase 1 programme for the introduction of water meters would be an incredible waste of resources.  Having said that, I remember the statistics from 2014 on the number of properties identified as having major leaks.  One property in particular was leaking 1 million litres of water per week, enough to supply the entire town of Lusk in north county Dublin.  I recall Deputy Brendan Howlin referenced Enniscorthy, a town with a similar population.  The bottom line is that without water meters that would not have been identified, because they were not on-premises leaks.  It is good that we are installing meters and it would be an extraordinary waste of our resources if we failed to utilise the meters that have been installed.  Whether we agree with it from an ideological perspective, the meters are in place.  They cannot be taken out and stored like the e-voting machines, never to be seen again.  The bottom line is that they are in place, the taxpayer has paid for them and we should use them.<\/p> <p> I made the point about Ireland being the only country in Europe or the OECD that has not had water charges heretofore.  We are a unique nation in the sense of our partnership with the European Union.  We like to think of ourselves as being special to some degree, but really we are not.  We are an incredibly impressive country in terms of what we achieve.  This is a small island on the outskirts of Europe, yet we are world leaders in so many areas.  We have a highly skilled workforce and a vibrant economy, which thankfully is beginning to come back.  However, we still do not accept the basic principle that everyone else pays for water production and that we pay 49.5% marginal income tax.  That is quite enough.<\/p><p>A person on a low to medium or an above-average income who is asked, \"Will you pay more tax to have proper water infrastructure?\" will always answer, \"No.  I pay enough tax already.\"<\/p> <p> For 50 years our taxation system fundamentally failed to invest enough taxpayers' money into water infrastructure because it was underground and could not be seen.  Local authority members were more engaged in fixing potholes, putting in playgrounds and things like that, which is fine.  I was a councillor for seven years and accept that is what happened.  However, for over 50 years Ministers in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government failed to invest properly.<\/p> <p> The suspension of water charges, as envisaged in the Bill, presents a difficulty for me and many others who worked very hard to ensure that this arrangement was introduced in the first place.  It was not something we wanted to do, but it was the right thing to do to ensure the burden on taxpayers was reduced in their individual taxation bills which incentivised work.  We took over in March 2011 and we hit the bottom in March 2012.  At that point this was designed to allow us to move forward, have a sustainable level of investment by the consumer in our infrastructure and see the rewards.  We have ramped up investment, from &euro;250 million in 2012 to approximately &euro;550 million this year.<\/p> <p> I can state clearly and unambiguously that the suspension of water charges because of political impetus is abhorrent to me.  However, I accept that if we had not done this Irish Water would already have been abolished and charges with it.  I hope we can have a meaningful debate across the House in a respectful way, as it should be, to ensure we get the best possible outcome from the debate.  We should not simply ignore the expertise we are bringing in which, I am sure, will be agreed by the House, because of a political or misplaced ideological position.  I understand we do not want to increase the burden on people but we need to face the reality that if we do not continue with a reasonable level of charge, it will result in a curtailment of public services or an increase in taxation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800037#KK00200","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467137400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Deputy Anne Rabbitte.<\/p><p>I listened to Deputy Alan Farrell's rather grudging acceptance of the Bill.

That was done by the previous Government and in particular the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy spoke of political expediency in introducing the Bill, but he did not acknowledge the lack of accountability.  He did not acknowledge that people would accept that the construction the previous Government presented to people to deliver water did not have democratic legitimacy.  As a result, the majority of this House as it is currently constituted has a mandate to change and get rid of water fees because of the mistakes and the manner in which the ball was dropped by the previous Government.<\/p>  <p>  A little humility in terms of the implementation would go a long way.  We all want that respectful debate and the Bill allows for that to be done with a commission involving experts who know the story internationally.  Had that been done at the beginning of the Irish Water charade rather than being rammed down the throat of the people and being set up in a gold-plated way without having any kind of sense of the delivery of the service, the story and this debate might be very different.  However, we are here.<\/p>  <p>  Our legal advice is different from that contained in the latest European Commission contribution.

It never achieved the support of the people.  I hope other events in the past 72 hours will force the Commission to consider how it is doing its job of implementing the ideals of the European Union to which we all subscribe.  In terms of representing and reflecting the opinion of people, it must engage with people's concerns and people have serious concerns about water and water charges in this country.  While I accept we have different legal opinions, politically the European Commission needs to put this one on its radar.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to bring to the Minister's attention a number of issues in the construct of the Bill.  Speaking as a rural Deputy, primary among them is the future role of group water schemes in delivering water services.  For the most part, group water schemes are accepted as an essential part of water infrastructure.  The members and clients of group water schemes have no difficulty in paying for the service.  The majority of them are open to the community or part of the community.  All this shows how different the construct of Irish Water could have been.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that somebody from the National Federation of Group Water Schemes should sit on the commission to bring that experience to bear and bring the views of those who will continue to pay water charges to that table.  It is a very Irish way to deliver water through the group water scheme network.  Many communities, if they had depended on a State organisation to deliver water, would still be waiting for water, but community-led activity with support from the Department through subsidies ensured they got water.<\/p>  <p>  I have always said we should consider the group water scheme model of delivery in other areas, for instance, broadband, to get services into those areas where central government puts it to the end of the queue or where private companies never bother.  It is essential that the voice of group water schemes and their users are represented on the commission and that their views are listened to and not just ticked off.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the commitment that the capitation that was reduced in line with the &euro;100 grant will be increased.  We put huge pressures and demands on group water schemes, which is as it should be for delivering an essential service.  It is important that it be delivered properly and healthily.  We also need to give them support in doing that.  During the years there has been a very good relationship between the former Department, the federation and the various schemes and it is important that continues.<\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to continue the subsidies that were provided under the CL&Aacute;R programme for bringing water into the most remote areas of the country that can still not get it.  It is important that this commitment is fulfilled.  There are still areas which do not have huge populations but where there are young families who may be the basis of renewing a community and they need to have water.  Without the old CL&Aacute;R programme they will not get it.<\/p>  <p>  In that vein, I have noticed a trend in the few planning applications we have seen in recent times, which thankfully are beginning to increase, whereby the water connection fee being charged by Irish Water and local authorities is extraordinary and bordering on extortionate.  If we want to encourage families back into rural communities, we need to assist them and not penalise them with development levies and then with a separate water connection fee.  In one case a family with two young babies trying to build a house in a rural community are being charged &euro;2,400 just to connect their house, which is not that far away.  We need to look at that in an holistic way.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, working with the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, can look at the way water connection fees are constructed.  I accept that they have to be charged, but they should be charged in a way that encourages people and does not penalise them for wanting to move into a rural area.<\/p><p> I want to give credit to the people who work for Irish Water for the central role they have successfully played in the important task of planning.  We have identified that it is important for a water utility to have an overarching role as we move forward.  Notwithstanding my criticism of Irish Water - I can only speak for the staff in the west region - I have always acknowledged that its team did this very well.  We did not need such a large institution to be created in such a gold-plated manner, but that is what happened under the watch of the Minister's predecessor.  We needed something much smaller with the ability to react in a speedy manner.  We needed a body that could work with the local authority staff who knew the connections on the ground.  That is something Irish Water has done well.<\/p> <p> The notion that there will be a collapse in the amount of money we are spending on water infrastructure does not add up.  If Deputies compare the amount of money spent in recent years with the amount provided directly for councils during Fianna F&aacute;il's time in government, they will find that we were spending more on capital infrastructure than Irish Water has been spending.  While I accept that moneys will be better spent by a national co-ordinating body, I do not agree that we need the big, gold-plated, larger-than-life operation that Irish Water has been up to now.  I know the word \"humility\" is not in the dictionary or the pattern of behaviour of the Minister's immediate predecessor.  In the Minister's approach to the new commission in the next nine months, he must acknowledge what was done wrong.  He must acknowledge the occasions on which legislation and regulations were rushed through the Chamber in a band-aid style manner in the hope that the legitimacy that had flowed away from Irish Water from its establishment would somehow return.  That could not be rectified, which is why we are here now.  I do not think the legitimacy of water charges will ever be won back because of the disaster that was Irish Water.  We should now recreate a water delivery mechanism that will achieve the support of people, work on a national basis in conjunction with the regional plans and the local authorities and meet the water infrastructure needs of a 21st century country.  That must be done in a manner that will instil confidence from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800039#MM00600","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467138000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2016.  Like my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, I support the Bill.  I will not discuss the various legal clarifications that are outstanding at this time.  As a result of the Bill which reflects the first part of Fianna F&aacute;il's agreement to facilitate a minority Government, water charges will be suspended immediately.  I thank the Minister for outlining the timeframe the other day.  The suspension period will begin on 1 July, when the work of the commission will kick in.  We should receive a report on how it is going in December.  The special Oireachtas committee will report back in March and the D&aacute;il will subsequently vote on its recommendations.  I understand that if the committee has not fully completed its work, the Minister can determine that the timeframe available to it needs to be expanded.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, has spoken really well about rural schemes and I do not need to rehash what has been said.  One of the reasons we as a party did not support water charges in the very beginning was that we did not believe people should pay for water that was not drinkable.  Like many other Deputies, I have experience of this in my home area of east Galway.  I live in Portumna where the water is chlorinated on a regular basis because its quality is not great.  Eight miles out the road in Woodford there are lead pipes with asbestos connections which are regularly broken.  The people of Woodford have waited 15 years for these pipes and asbestos connections to be improved.  The footpaths have not been repaired during that time.  It was only last year, following the establishment of Irish Water, that they realised they would never have the road repaired because they had gone from No. 11 to No. 33 on the waiting list.  I refer to Main Street in Woodford.  Although funding was subsequently sought and - fair play to Galway County Council and the Department - the road was repaired, I suggest that in itself was a signal that the pipes were not going to be repaired.<\/p>  <p>  There are other issues with Irish Water in Loughrea, 20 km away.  When rain falls, the back gardens of houses in the Coscorrig estate are completely flooded.  I suggest this is happening continuously because no one in Irish Water is answerable.  We are not feeling its funding coming to us.  We could not feel the value of the Irish Water infrastructure because we believed it was a quango.  In fact, it was more about public relations and the propaganda of selling its image than it was about giving benefits to people on the ground.  The people of Loughrea are still subject to a boil water notice.  We cannot get answers when we ask when they will come off it.  This issue is having an impact not only on the people of Loughrea but also on the people of Craughwell, further into the county, who are included in the same water scheme.  I am trying to build a picture to show the Minister how Irish Water has failed the people of east Galway.  I am not just talking about the rural schemes in the villages; I am also talking about towns.  Portumna, Woodford, Loughrea and Craughwell have all been affected.  People were paying their water charges all the while, even though they felt really reluctant to do so because they were receiving such a poor service.  The water was not drinkable and subject to a boil water notice.  The authorities in Portumna cannot apply for a blue flag because there is no reason to believe the water supply in the locality will be of sufficient quality two years in a row.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister might say the problems I have mentioned are not all of Irish Water's doing, but I suggest they can be attributed to its failure to put in place an overarching umbrella to support us.  When I sat on Galway County Council, we struggled to get clear-cut answers from representatives of Irish Water.  When they came before us, they were unable to give us definite answers.  They could not give a timeframe for delivery, for example.  Everything needs to be subject to time management.  People need to receive feedback, but we were not getting the relevant feedback.  Both parties have agreed to this legislation which will send this issue out to a commission in order that people can talk about it.  We need to find a deliverable solution that will ensure the infrastructure - the pipes and personnel, etc. - will be in place before people on the ground are ever asked to pay water charges again.  There is a need for a a timeframe for anything that needs to be delivered.  People do not want to pay for water that they cannot drink.  They should not have to go down the road to SuperValu or Aldi to buy water, while paying water charges at the same time.  I do not want to have to represent people in such circumstances.  I do not believe we should have to pay for water if we cannot drink it.  I do not have to say anything more than that.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to what will come out of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800040#NN00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1467138000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important legislation.  Some Members of the D&aacute;il would have suggested it could never be facilitated.  We would not be discussing it if it were not for the composition of this D&aacute;il.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, and the other members of the Fianna F&aacute;il negotiating team for ensuring this legislation would be debated in the D&aacute;il and part of the arrangement for facilitating a minority Government.<\/p>  <p>  I know that representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in like to hop up and down.  They are masters of the art of expressing sheer indignation.  When they are representing people's views, they show how outraged they are about this, that and the other.  They put proposals before the D&aacute;il in its early stages during Private Members' business as part of an effort to claim some political credit, even though they absented themselves in having any hand, act or part in the negotiations and talks on the formation of a Government.  They did not consider supporting a minority Fine Gael Government or a minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  They did not consider abstaining to enable some formation to come together in the national interest.  They did not feel a duty to alleviate the need to return to the country in a second general election.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation will suspend water charges for a nine-month period.<\/p><p>From 1 July, anyone who has been paying water charges will not have to pay any for nine months.  It will afford an opportunity for all Members, after the commission has investigated and reported back, to debate fully where we go from here.  My party has stated it is opposed to water charges, like the majority of Members of the D&aacute;il.  If the majority stay true to their commitment, water charges will not be reintroduced.<\/p> <p> How did we reach this point?  As previous speakers said, we reached it because of the manner in which the previous Government - initially the then Minister and now European Commissioner, Phil Hogan, and subsequently Deputy Alan Kelly - went about the creation and establishment of Irish Water.  It was an unbelievable series of disasters.  What we saw was possibly the worst ever introduction and implementation of a public policy with U-turn after U-turn.  First, PPS numbers were to be mandatory, with the claim that there was no way it could be done without them, but, lo and behold, that was changed.  Second, a fee structure was put in place which, again, could not be changed, but, lo and behold, a conservation grant was introduced.  In itself, the grant was the biggest con job of all times.  Regardless of whether somebody paid for water or whether they used 10 litres a week or 110 litres a day, everyone received the same amount under the heading of conservation grant.  Like many of my colleagues, I saw old age pensioners who did not have the wherewithal to face another tax wondering how they would pay their water charges.  The previous Government gave itself much wriggle room and leeway to change and modify policy to suit the political reality at the time, yet no leeway or concession was given to some elderly people who had failed to apply for the conservation grant owing to their age, or who were not able apply online because they had no family support, or who were afraid to deal with Irish Water in any manner or means.  With a deadline set in stone, they missed out on the &euro;100 grant.  No leeway was given to them, but there was plenty for the Government as it moved from crisis to crisis when establishing Irish Water.<\/p> <p> Irish Water was established on the premise that it would be able to borrow off balance sheet and, accordingly, bring forward a large-scale investment programme in water infrastructure around the country.  That was right as a large investment is needed in water infrastructure.  However, the Government went about spending &euro;500 million on water meters, which are not used, and over &euro;100 million on consultants to set up Irish Water.  In its first year of operation Irish Water lost &euro;22 million.  I do not know how losing &euro;22 million could be considered to be good practice in investing in large-scale development, but I suppose it is down to how the original legislation establishing Irish Water was introduced in the D&aacute;il.  In that particular week I remember that we on this side of the House were ridiculed for merely questioning the time given to debate the legislation.  We were shot down and it was deemed that the debate on the Bill would be guillotined.  Less than three hours were given to debate one of the most important Bills to pass through the last D&aacute;il.  By virtue of the fact that it went from having a majority of 30 seats to being 30 short, I hope and expect the Government realises that those on the Opposition benches have ideas and an important role to play in the scrutiny of legislation.  That explains why this legislation is being debated in the D&aacute;il now.<\/p> <p> It is disingenuous when one sees Labour Party Members introducing legislation similar to that against which they actually voted in the previous Seanad.  Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward legislation in the Seanad to ensure Irish Water would always remain a public utility.  At the time the Labour Party Members of the Seanad voted against it, claiming it was not needed.  It is amazing how a person's opinion can change when he or she moves from the Government to the Opposition benches.  Just like Deputy Alan Kelly when Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government tried to fool the electorate and failed, I do not believe they will be fooled by the Labour Party&rsquo;s most recent proposals.<\/p> <p> Under the Water Services Act 2007, if there is a problem with or a leak from public sewerage under a public roadway or footpath, it is the responsibility of Irish Water.  Before that, it was down to the local authority to deal with it.  Whether it was on purpose or an error in the 2007 Act, a problem has emerged with public sewerage in older housing estates.  For example, many local authority houses on Green Road, in O&rsquo;Growney Drive and St. Bridget&rsquo;s Terrace in Mullingar have been bought out.  To keep costs down when such estates were being built, the sewer pipes were not placed along the main road or the back lane.  Instead, they were placed right at the back door of the houses.  Accordingly, if there is a blockage in the sewer pipes, it is deemed to be the house owner's responsibility, even though it is actually a public sewer.  These home owners are being penalised as Irish Water will not correct the problem.  This needs to be examined.  It is not the house owner's fault that when the houses were constructed, the pipes were not placed along the main road or in a public space.<\/p> <p> Again today we heard the European Union's opinion on whether we can have derogation in the case of Irish Water.<\/p><p>Sometimes, when one hears the European Union coming out on cases such as this, it seems like it is meddling in the national affairs of a particular country.  For all of the positives which were debated at length in this House only yesterday in the light of Brexit, when we hear the European Union stating it will determine whether we can implement the will of the people through this legislation, we do not have to wonder why some people are fed up with it or why some actually voted in the way they did in the recent referendum in the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> On the whole, this is welcome legislation.  As I said, it gives an opportunity to suspend water charges for a period of nine months, during which time we will have an opportunity to consider a funding model that is fair and equitable and that will not place an unnecessary financial burden or hardship on people.  Let us remember the way the original legislation was introduced.  It was introduced on the basis that a person in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension of &euro;230 a week who was struggling to survive was to pay the exact same annual amount in water charges as someone like me.  The Minister may disagree, but that is the case.  I am thinking of an old age pensioner living alone in a local authority house who is receiving &euro;230 a week and paying rent, electricity bills and prescription charges.  That person simply could not survive.  The outgoing Government in its introduction of water charges never once took account of a person's ability to pay or thought of the person who could not afford further charges, who was living hand to mouth and waiting for Friday to arrive every week in order to collect his or her old age pension.  This is not made up; it is factual.  It is welcome that from 1 July water charges will be suspended.  <\/p> <p> I wish the commission well in its deliberations and coming forward with proposals that will ensure we can raise the necessary funding to make the investment needed in towns and villages across my constituency and in every other in order that we can see them develop and grow.  At the same time, the charges must not be put on the backs of ordinary, decent working people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800040#NN00300","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467139200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about this issue.  I am coming at it from a different side in that I am speaking on behalf of those who are being billed twice.  <\/p>  <p>  In Sligo and, I am sure, other counties Veolia was given the contract some years ago for the implementation of the water scheme and the collection of charges.  At an earlier stage, we contacted it to point out that people were being charged twice, that they were being charged once by Veolia and again by Irish Water.  Some months ago, when I contacted Irish Water, it was very helpful and at the time resolved the issues involved.  People were to get a refund of what they had paid.  However, more recently, when I contacted Irish Water again, the situation had been more difficult and the result often depends on the person to whom I am talking.<\/p>  <p>  The point is that once people are billed by one utility, they should not be billed again.  It is wrong that people have to pay twice.  When people are with Veolia, they pay &euro;20 per quarter for the meter, or &euro;80 a year, and if they have a second meter, they pay again.  For this, they receive 50,000 gallons of water a year and then pay for any water they use above that amount, as many people do.  I would like to see this issue sorted out.<\/p>  <p>  What will happen to those who are part of group schemes?  They organised themselves as a group and applied for and received grants to provide water schemes.  In some cases they had to contribute &pound;4,000 or &pound;5,000 individually.  They have been paying for water continuously during the years.  What does the Minister propose to do for them?  I believe they are being overcharged and it is wrong that they should have to pay when others do not.  I ask the Minister to try to resolve the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Sligo County Council has made an application in respect of sewerage schemes.  There is a group scheme that takes in Grange, Tubbercurry and Enniscrone, all of which are under severe pressure.  The applications in respect of these schemes have been in place for many years and there have been a few false dawns.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to see whether they can be progressed as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800042#PP00200","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1467139200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the commentary from colleagues on all sides of the House.  I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.  This is a very short Bill and there has been little discussion on the technicalities of the legislation.  I hope we will have an opportunity to do this on Committee Stage in the coming days when we will go through the Bill line by line to make sure we get it right.<\/p>  <p>  Essentially, the thinking behind the legislation is clear.  It is about trying to create a window of opportunity to have a less politicised discussion on how we pay for domestic water services in terms of the supply of clean, safe water, which clearly is not the case in parts of the country.  That is evidence, if we needed it, that we need to change the system we use to deliver water.  The previous system was operated through the local authorities which were under-funded in many cases.  Although there were many good engineers within the local authorities, the reality is we had a very disjointed system, with individual local authorities trying to do their own thing.  When we look at the statistics, the results are shocking; some 49% of water leaks through pipes before it reaches its supposed destination, thousands of people are subject to boil water notices for long periods and raw sewage is going into harbours, rivers and lakes.<\/p>  <p>  The House does not need me to make the arguments on the need for an improved water treatment and delivery system for households across Ireland.  I hope the discussion in the next nine months will be about how we do this, who pays for it and how it is to be paid for.  The one constant in this debate is that everybody accepts that we need to pay for water and that this is not a free resource in terms of its treatment and management.  What the debate is about is whether we should pay for it through general taxation, whether there should be a household contribution element for the amount of water used, whether the volumes used should be paid for in full by households or whether some other metric should be used.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to other parties during this process to contribute to that debate.  Within the next couple of days - certainly this week - we will have the announcement of an expert commission.  I have tried to ensure a real balance on the commission in terms of legal and technical expertise and knowledge, including an input from group water schemes.  This interaction with the commission will certainly be facilitated in the next five months in order that we can come to a set of recommendations on which it will be up to us to decide as the democratically elected representatives of the people.<\/p><p>For some, this will not be an easy process because many people have already committed politically to an outcome, which in some ways is not helpful to the process.  Fine Gael has a political policy position on how water should be paid for, as do Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  No party has a majority in this House anymore; therefore, we are trying to put in place a structure to put some questions and options on the table which make sense, first and foremost, for households in the provision of water, in the belief that the delivery system will work for them and that it will be fair.  If there are two neighbours who use dramatically different volumes of water, for whatever reason, is it fair that they effectively pay the same amount for that resource through general taxation?  It is not and neither is it fair to ask somebody who cannot afford it to pay for water.  There is now such a structure in place.  <\/p> <p> I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for supporting this legislation, even though its position on it is very different from mine.  I hope it is an indication that it will buy into the process and try to work with and contribute to it.  In nine months time we will have an all-party Oireachtas committee which will bring forward recommendations to the House, regardless of how uncomfortable they may be for some of us.  There is a risk for everybody, but probably more so for the Government parties than for anybody else.  We will, however, take on board the committee's recommendations and have an honest and informed discussion without the constant political manoeuvring whereby all political parties and none try to outmanoeuvre each other to be more popular on this issue.  Real anger and resentment have been encouraged through the water debates that have taken place on the streets and in this House.  My job as Minister is to deal with the issue.  <\/p> <p> As people get to know me, I hope they will get to know that I am someone who wants to listen to other perspectives.  I might not agree with them all of the time, but there should be consensus in the House on water as a resource and how we deliver and should pay for it in order that as Governments change there will not be radical changes of policy on the delivery of something as fundamental as water.  If we did that in the case of electricity, the country would not be able to function.  If we did it in the case of gas, we would have huge difficulties and interruptions in supply and funding models.  It is a little like what the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, is trying to do in the health service because it is a fundamental service for the public.  There is no more fundamental provision of a resource into people's homes than the provision of water and, as Minister, I will try to facilitate that process.  <\/p> <p> I will be in Brussels next week to meet the European Commissioner for the Environment who I know quite well because he is also the marine Commissioner and I was formerly the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I know him well from negotiations on fisheries and he is a very decent and straight individual.  I have already spoken to him at length on the telephone.  I want to go to Brussels in person to explain what we are trying to do.  For an outsider, the resentment, marches, protests and anger seem like a very strange process in the politics of water provision, especially to people in other countries who have been paying domestic water charges for a generation, or certainly for decades.  I am not pretending for one minute that it is contrived.  The anger many people feel towards water charges is genuine and to try to get acceptance of a new financing model will not be easy in that context.  There have been a lot of mistakes made which have led to that anger, but there is also politics being played which has encouraged it.  When I talk about trying to take the politics out of water provision, I am not talking about trying to create some cosy consensus with which everybody will be comfortable but rather about having an informed debate to make a decision that can last through various changes of Government, which will undoubtedly happen in the next number of decades.  We should have a consistent and sustainable approach to water provision which is consistent with our obligations and commitments, both nationally and internationally.  It is something we want to embrace rather than have forced on us by a water framework directive.  <\/p> <p> The issue of public ownership has been raised repeatedly.  There is no privatisation agenda in the Government on water services.  If one looks at the legislation that safeguards this, for any future Government to privatise Irish Water, it would have to obtain permission to do so through a plebiscite.  It would require a referendum for it to happen.  That is the length to which the last Government went to to reassure people that there was no privatisation agenda.  The previous model of water delivery whereby local authorities were forced to outsource the building and management of water treatment facilities to private companies was leading to privatisation by stealth.  Irish Water is taking back ownership of many of wastewater treatment facilities; it is a reversal of what was happening previously in the context of privatisation.  I am open to suggestions others may have to provide further reassurances in maintaining Irish Water as a publicly owned utility and to reassure people that there is no privatisation agenda.  Let us look at what we can do in that regard.  I have listened to what people have been saying, but it is not as simple as holdindg a referendum on water infrastructure given the complexities around private ownership of much of the water infrastructure in rural Ireland through group water schemes.  People are perfectly happy with the current infrastructure which is working quite well and which they are financing.  For group water schemes, we are moving to ensure the financial models and supports in place before the introduction of the water conservation grant will be returned to.  We have spoken to the National Federation of Group Water Schemes about this and it seems to be very happy with what we are proposing to do.  We are also proposing to increase the grant aid available for private wells and their maintenance.  There is nothing to fear for group water schemes or those who have been paying for their water for many years.     <\/p> <p> There are contracts in place to finish phase 1 of the water metering programme and we will see it through.  There is a second phase which is more complex in providing meters in apartment complexes and other housing units that are not as easy to access.  Decisions will be made in the future in that regard; we are not making any decision on it right now.  <\/p> <p> I am not going to start holding a stick over people because of their legal views in interpreting the Water Framework Directive.  All I am saying is the European Commission's view on it does not come as a surprise to Fine Gael and it should not come as a surprise to anybody else either.  Let us wait and see how it assesses the issue.  There will be legal expertise in the commission which will look at the issues and listen to the arguments and what people have to say.  It will make an independent assessment and recommendations in the five months it will be working on the issue.  Let us wait and see what it will state.  I am happy to let it do this, but some people seem to be hugely surprised by and contest what the European Commission has been stating on the issue.  It should not come as a surprise at all.<\/p> <p> This process is about trying to fix some of the failings to which people have been referring repeatedly.  I appeal to them to work with us on the issue.<\/p><p>Who knows, in the not too distant future, Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in may be in government and it will be their responsibility to try to ensure we deliver an improved water provision each year and make sure fewer people will be subject to boil water notices and fewer families will be affected by public health issues that are impacted on by pollution and poor water quality.<\/p> <p> When we look at what Irish Water is planning to do in dealing with leaks between now and 2021, its targets are clear.  It aims to move from a figure of 49% to 38%.  This can only be done over a phased period.  All of the leaks cannot be plugged overnight.  It is hugely expensive, but Irish Water is committed to continuing that process.  Not only that, we will essentially have an observation body which is also being set up as part of the nine-month process and which will report quarterly to the Oireachtas to ensure the targets which are being set in the business plan for Irish Water and on which the regulator is insisting are being met.  We will have an independent monitoring body to report to the committee and the Oireachtas to make sure that will be the case.  That is part of what we are trying to do in creating an acceptance and an understanding of the challenges Irish Water faces and how it is responding to them on behalf of the State which will continue to own it into the future.<\/p> <p> I look forward to hearing what Members will have to say on Committee Stage.  I ask Members to try to facilitate the movement of this legislation as quickly as possible.  Let us not forget that we are effectively introducing a freeze on water charges from 1 July, in a few days time.  By the time the legislation is finalised and enacted, it will effectively be retrospective for a number of days or a week or two.  That is fine and there is nothing extraordinary about it.  However, the sooner we get it through, the sooner we will provide certainty.  It will allow the commission to get on with its work and allow the process to begin to, I hope, resolve some of the issues that have been the source of a lot of frustration for Members opposite.  It will allow us to move on from this issue, as I think many of us would like to do, and focus on the many other challenges that the Government and the House have to face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800042#PP00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467140400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1467140400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Unanimous support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800044#RR00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1467140400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>All six of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800044#RR00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee","time":1467140400,"counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800044#RR00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1467140400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(a) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees<b>.<\/b><\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800044#RR00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467140400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Energy Bill 2016 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1467140400,"counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800044#RR00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467140400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1467140400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I understand two Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies - Deputies James Lawless and John brassil - will now make their contributions, but there may be a third.

As I sit on the relevant committee, I am aware that we are due to receive it tomorrow.  I, therefore, hope it will proceed smoothly this evening.  I have a number of comments to make on the energy sector as a whole and the Bill also.<\/p>  <p>  Sustainable energy and energy security are desirable and targets to which we all aspire to achieving.  They are targets we can and should do more to achieve.  Before I deal with that issue and the Bill specifically, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge concerns in the energy sector that have arisen not only in my own constituency but in others also.  This is not necessarily directly pertinent to the Bill but more so to the energy sector as a whole.  It is a good opportunity to air them in the House.<\/p>  <p>  There appears to be an over-concentration in this country and others on a single form of renewable energy, wind energy, wind turbines in particular.  Their prevalence in the midlands, along the western and the north-west coasts, etc, has been controversial and many applications have been refused as a result.  I refer, in particular, to the Emlagh wind farm in County Meath and also the O'Grianna case on the west coast in which various court decisions led to an overturning of the decision.  The Emlagh case went to the High Court in which the objectors won their case.<\/p>  <p>  Some legitimate concerns have been raised and I do not necessarily agree with all of them.  Some of the concerns expressed about the wind energy sector, in particular, are grounded in reality.  Set-back distances remain a concern in many areas.  The question of efficiency has been raised as regards whether a spinning reserve is required.  Is there a need to depend on a fossil fuel, a non-renewable form of energy, to keep turbines in action at times when the wind speed is not sufficient to power them.  The provision of turbines has been extremely divisive within communities.  That is a fact we can all acknowledge.<\/p>  <p>  Public consultation has been lacking in many cases where wind energy project developers - the \"big wind\" as it is termed - have arrived in communities under the cover of a notice in a less well accessed publication.  I saw this happen in Johnstownbridge in the Hamlet Court Hotel when, on a dark Tuesday night in November, a public consultation meeting took place about which nobody had heard, before or since.  That is regrettable and not the way to engage with communities and secure their goodwill.  I saw it first hand in the case of the Macken wind farm and the Maighne wind farm.  The other point of note is that sometimes wind farms tend to span more than one county or local authority area.  It can be difficult for county councils if there are three turbines in one county, four in another and five in yet another in close proximity.  It can mean that there are multiple applications being dealt which, in some cases, end up being referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  What seemingly is unprecedented, in the case of the Maighne wind farm with which I am most familiar, is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has repeatedly deferred making a decision.  Initially it was due to be made last September; then it was due to be made in February or March and now it is being deferred again.  I did not realise the legislation gave An Bord Plean&aacute;la powers to do this, but obviously it does or it is being done in any case.  I flag these concerns to the House.<\/p>  <p>  While we all wish to embrace renewable energy, it is important to diversify and scatter what is in our basket beyond one source.  I refer to the guidelines.  It would be a gesture of good faith on the part of the Department and the Minister if they moved ahead with new ones.  We are aware that the guidelines are outdated.  Anyone with even the faintest knowledge of the sector will be aware of this.  New wind turbine guidelines are long-awaited.  The technology is very fast-moving and always has been.  If we want to embrace the sector and the concerns of communities, it is very important that we move on the guidelines as soon as possible as a positive step, to put communities out of their misery and win buy-in among the wider community.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly discuss the positives.  For four days solid in early May Portugal ran on renewable energy sources.  Electricity stations were powered entirely by solar, wind and hydro power sources for a 107-hour period from 7 to 11 May.  That is an extremely positive example of how well it can work.  Elsewhere in the European Union, Germany achieved an even more impressive feat also in the month of May.  Prices were in the negative for a while, something I am sure householders here would welcome.  The renewable energy sector needs the right framework to compete with fossil fuel plant operators to make it competitive and place it in a context in which it can bypass fossil fuel plant operators on efficiency and competitive grounds also.  I look forward to the Bill moving to the next Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800044#RR01100","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1467140400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I wish to quote a conclusion made by the Minister in his contribution on the Bill:<\/p><blockquote>The Bill does not set out to revise or recast the energy regulatory framework in an all-embracing or comprehensive way.  Whether such wider and more comprehensive reform is required will be addressed by the review of the legal and institutional framework for the regulation of electricity and natural gas markets, including the Commission for Energy Regulation's mandate.<\/blockquote><p>I will discuss the mandate and important role of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, particularly in the case of a project very close to my heart in County Kerry, known as the Shannon LNG project.  It was initiated in 2006 and involves an investment of &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion to bring liquefied natural gas into Ireland for the first time.  It was going exceedingly well until approximately 2009 when a decision by the CER to implement a new tariff structure for the gas coming through the interconnector across the Irish Sea put it in abeyance.  I have already spoken to the new Minister about it and last Wednesday we had a very productive meeting with a delegation from the community, the company, local councillors and Deputies.  The project has been designated as a national strategic infrastructure project and the European Commission has awarded it project of common interest, PCI, status which means that it wants it to be built for the reasons outlined in the policy statement of 2016.  The project ticks all of the boxes.  It would ensure security of supply in a very difficult market, particularly given that we are dependent on gas from a source 4,000 miles away in which the political situation is very volatile.  It would provide for diversity in the Irish gas market, connectivity to the global LNG market and have the added benefit of low carbon emissions.<br\/><br\/>In recent times, following the European Commission's intervention in awarding the project PCI status, the support of Bord G&aacute;is Energy and Gas Networks Ireland has been critical.  We are looking not only at importing gas at Ballylongford but also at reverse flowing it through the interconnector to supply gas to the United Kingdom and northern Europe.  The project has great potential.  The worldwide LNG industry wants to competitively supply the Irish and north-west European gas market through the Shannon LNG terminal.  In order for this to happen, the key players are the industry with an investor, Gas Networks Ireland, which owns the network and Bord G&aacute;is Energy which controls the interconnectors.  We must all act together.<br\/><br\/>Coincidentally, the project is mentioned in A Programme for a Partnership Government, which I very much welcome.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The new Government remains supportive of the proposal to construct a LNG terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry.  The LNG facility would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market.  The prospect of such a facility would be a positive step for the island of Ireland.  While the regulation of the gas market is the responsibility of the energy regulator we will request the national dialogue on climate change to examine if there are ways to facilitate liquid natural gas on the island of Ireland.<\/blockquote><p>How does the Government intend to implement this policy statement in a manner that will result in successful investment and job creation in the Shannon region?  It is in all of our interests to make the project happen.  The regulator, the Minister and the industry have key roles to play and we must work together to get the project over the line.  The knock-on benefits for a rural county such as Kerry would be immeasurable.  There is immense potential for knock-on industries that would flow from such a development in Ballylongford.  There is, therefdore, an onus on us all to try to make it happen.  In a spirit of co-operation, I ask the players mentioned to get together to get the project over the line.<br\/><br\/>New wind energy guidelines have been proposed for many years, but deadlines have come and gone.  I ask that the new guidelines be published before the summer recess, if possible, or, at the latest, by September to give guidance to the industry.  This is critical.  An interest in solar energy has emerged.  There are a number of projects in my county, one of which has been submitted for planning.  Owing to a delay regarding the PSO charge that will be applied to solar energy projects, there is confusion in the industry and people do not know what the benefits will be and whether they should go ahead and develop solar energy farms.  The issue must be resolved quickly to allow development in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800044#RR01200","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467141000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>This is my first opportunity in the House to congratulate Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne and wish him well on his appointment as Minister of State.  <\/p>  <p>  As my party colleagues have stated, we broadly support the Energy Bill 2016 which mainly involves amendments to existing energy Acts and strengthens secondary legislation, which is very important.  One issue of concern to us and consumers throughout the country is the high retail energy prices footed by consumers, despite the collapse in wholesale gas prices.  Consumers are not seeing an equivalent drop in the prices charged to them that should be expected due to the fall in prices worldwide.  My colleagues in this debate have indicated that the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, must be reformed and empowered to take account of the impact of current retail prices being foisted on consumers by energy providers which is having an effect on the prices paid by consumers and competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  One project is a source of serious contention in the north east of the country, namely, the proposed North-South interconnector.  During this and the previous D&aacute;il, I have raised the issue by way of parliamentary questions, but I have never received a satisfactory response.  The former Minister, Alex White, always dodged the question by outlining that the matter was before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  None of us expects anybody to interfere with the work of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but we did not receive satisfactory answers during that period from the former Minister or his predecessor, Pat Rabbitte.  Last August I made a detailed submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the proposed project, with Councillor Clifford Kelly, one of my councillors in County Cavan.  We lodged a detailed objection last August and our colleague in the Oireachtas, Senator Robbie Gallagher, with his then council colleagues in Monaghan, Seamus Coyle, P. J. O'Hanlon and Padraig McNally, made a very detailed submission objecting very strongly to the proposed North-South interconnector.  Individuals, community groups and public representatives of other political parties submitted hundreds of very good objections.  <\/p>  <p>  Last January I welcomed the fact that An Bord Plean&aacute;la had agreed to hold an oral hearing, which took place over a period of many weeks in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan.  I participated in the oral hearing, with Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and public representatives of all other political parties.  I outlined clearly and strongly that I strongly objected to the proposed project.  Any public utility, in providing public services, must be cognisant of the concerns of individuals, families and communities about a project that will traverse so much of the country, as the proposed North-South interconnector will.  At the oral hearing the County Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee and the North East Pylon Pressure Campaign, representative of communities in counties Meath, Monaghan and Cavan, also made very detailed and well researched proposals and lodged objections to EirGrid's proposals.  With others, I outlined the many negative aspects of the planning application in terms of the unacceptable scenario that would arise with the construction of monstrous transmission lines through large parts of counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath.  The project, if permitted to proceed, will destroy heritage and tourism in the area and place huge impediments in the way of farming practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800045#SS00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467141000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Equal Status (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1467141600,"counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800046#TT00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1467141600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>Education policy can throw up many opinions and preferences, some of them contradictory, but most of us agree that children benefit from meeting and getting to know others from different backgrounds and religions.  Most of us agree that diversity in our schools is an opportunity for society, not something to feel threatened by.  No Member would support the idea of parents being coerced to baptise their children just to secure a school place for them.  We would, I hope, find this offensive, from both a religious and a secular perspective, yet most of us, certainly from the Dublin area, have come across these cases.  Most, if not all, Members agree that local children should have access to their local schools because they serve as the centre of our communities.  As society becomes more diverse and as more people opt out of the predefined roles assigned and imposed by religion, our school system faces a watershed.  Can it adapt and cope with the new demands that parents now make of it?<\/p><p>No single change in the law will meet all those parental demands.  In particular, where pupil applications outnumber pupil places, the solution will not be found simply by rewriting school admission policies; the solution is to build more schools, and that is what we did during our term in office.  Our national school system was originally intended to be religiously mixed way back in the 1800s.  However, from the beginning, all the main churches refused to co-operate in the provision of religiously mixed education.  Despite the State's intentions as the founder and funder of the system, it became overwhelmingly a denominational system of separate provision, and the State, in successive editions of the Rules for National Schools, increasingly recognised and even enshrined this denominational reality.  This development reached its peak in rule 68, which dates back to 1965.  In that rule, the Minister and the Department instructed our State-funded schools: &quot;Of all the parts of a school curriculum Religious Instruction is by far the most important&quot;.  Every school was instructed that a &quot;religious spirit&quot; was to inform and vivify all its work.  My colleague, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, rightly revoked this rule last December.  It is, of course, no function of the State to instruct schools about the place of religion in the education they provide.<\/p><p>The problem now is that we have a system of national schools that are privately owned but publicly funded, and access to those schools is decided by religion, but we still have a Constitution that envisages something different.  This goes back to the 1800s, and there is a clear tension between different constitutional provisions that have an impact on admission policy for our schools.  On the one hand, the Constitution makes it clear that the State is entitled to fund denominational schools and that those schools are entitled to provide religious instruction during the school day.  On the other, the Constitution also requires that legislation on State aid for schools must not prejudice the right of any child to attend a State-funded school while opting out of religious instruction.  This much has been stated in the Supreme Court: if a school accepts public funds, then any child, no matter what her or his religion, is entitled to attend that school and has the right not to attend any course of religious instruction at the school.  However, we as legislators have not yet come to terms with what this means and what it imposes on the design of our education system.<\/p><p>The Constitution Review Group reported in 1996 that Article 44.2.4&deg; had the potential to give rise to difficulties.  Our task, therefore, as legislators is to strike an appropriate balance between the right of a school to preserve its denominational ethos and the right of a child to attend a State-funded school and to avoid religious instruction there if that is what the parents of the child wish.  In other words, when a denominational school accepts State funding, it must accept that this aid is not given unconditionally.  The State-funded school must be prepared in principle and in practice to accept pupils from other denominations or none and to provide separate secular and religious instruction.  The Bill aims to achieve this effect in law.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that our Bill does not go as far as some commentators and interest groups would like, and I will spell out clearly why.  Discrimination in the provision of education is generally prohibited by the Equal Status Acts, but there is an exemption for denominational schools.  Section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the 2000 Act provides that a school does not discriminate where it admits one child in preference to another on religious grounds.  Some campaigners have called for a straightforward repeal of this subsection to end the exemption for schools from our anti-discrimination laws.  I acknowledge that the call has a certain appeal, but I believe this is seriously flawed as a solution.  Suppose the Act was amended to outlaw a discriminatory admissions policy for State-funded schools and it was insisted on that every school must be open first and foremost to its neighbouring children, with students enrolled on the basis of proximity rather than religion.  If there were two national schools in a particular area, one Catholic and one Presbyterian, both schools would no doubt protest against the change in the law but both would comply with it.  At the end of the admissions process, simple demographics dictates in the Republic that the Catholic school will still end up with a largely Catholic student population.  The problem is that the Protestant school will also, particularly if it is in my area of west Dublin or in Lucan or Swords, because the Catholic population is so numerous that, on a proximity basis, they would more than likely fill both schools.  If the law was amended in this manner, it would have to be applied equally and in a non-discriminatory way to schools of all Christian denominations and all minority faiths.  Ironically, even though those who want a change in the law are chiefly targeting Catholic schools, only these schools would survive the impact of such a change.<\/p><p>A repeal of, rather than an amendment to, section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) would spell a more or less immediate end to participation in our education system by the Church of Ireland and the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, as well as the Jewish and Islamic faiths.  This proposal might well appeal to ex-Catholics, but it takes no account of non-Catholics, and that must make it constitutionally dubious.  Since the public funding of denominational schools is contemplated by the Constitution itself, any preconditions that are imposed by the State to receive that funding could not be such as to destroy the denominational character of a school.  If schools admission policy was required to be entirely neutral on religion, the smaller the faith, the greater the risk that its schools would entirely lose their denominational character, a character our Constitution rightly entitles them to have.<\/p><p>Even if we were constitutionally entitled to do so, we in the Labour Party do not want to see an end to minority faith participation in schools and, therefore, our Bill does not seek to destroy the ethos of denominational schools.  It does seek, however, to impose conditions for State funding that reflect the requirements of the Constitution.  It falls to us to propose this Bill because the Government has already made clear that it has no intention of legislating in this area and we are back to the scenario of St. Augustine, the long grass, holding off and Lord let me do it some day but not just yet.<br\/><br\/>At present, the law states that a school can absolutely refuse to admit a child on religious grounds if the school can prove that the refusal is essential to maintain the school&rsquo;s ethos.  That would be a very hard case to prove and it is not used in practice.  Therefore, we do not propose to change this provision.  The Act also states that any denominational school can give preference to children of its own denomination.  There is no test of necessity and no proof required at all.  This exemption applies to every school, regardless of whether it is State-funded.  Such a preferential admissions policy might, for example, provide for admissions of, first, Catholics of the parish, then, second, Catholics from outside the parish, and then, third, local non-Catholics.<br\/><br\/>A &quot;religious first&quot; rule for enrolling students requires the production of a baptismal certificate or equivalent as a condition for admission.  As a result, non-baptised children can be turned away, especially in urban areas where schools are hugely over-subscribed.  I am very familiar with this in my area.  The patrons of all the different religious denominations and patrons such as Educate Together and community national schools work hard, notwithstanding the contradictions in our law, to ensure that as far as possible every child is a welcomed child in the school, regardless of religion or ethnic or cultural background.  We must acknowledge the aspect of the present law that sanctions a preferential admissions policy, admitting students from outside the school&rsquo;s catchment area in preference to those of a different religion or none who live in the area.  That is the problem with the existing law.  Such policies run the risk of depriving more and more non-Catholic children of education in their neighbourhoods.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Equal Status Act to redress the imbalance between the right to maintain denominational schools and the right of children to receive a secular education in a State-funded school.  Under our proposals, a denominational school&rsquo;s preference for one religion would only be accommodated to the extent that it is demonstrably needed, by reference to actual circumstances, to meet the demand for denominational education in its catchment area, in accordance with the conscience and lawful preference of parents.  Once that local need is met, the school cannot continue to prefer its own co-religionists to fill up the remaining places.  I should make it clear that we intend to allow each school to define its catchment area under its statutory enrolment policy.  Not every catchment area is equal in size.  A Catholic school may well be in a local parish comprising a few thousand houses while a Protestant school may well serve half a county.  We have examples of that in Dublin and in Meath.  We have that factual situation.<br\/><br\/>Another important change is proposed in our Bill.  It states that, in deciding whether an admissions policy or a refusal is proved to be essential, due regard must be had to the constitutional right of any child to attend a State-funded school without attending religious instruction, and also to the concomitant obligation that every such school should be so organised as to enable that right to be enjoyed.  If the local State-funded school is the only reasonably available school and it is a denominational school, then, notwithstanding its religious ethos, the secular and religious instruction in that school must be severable to enable a child to attend that school without receiving religious instruction.  Otherwise, the school should not qualify for public money.<br\/><br\/>I refer again to the report of the Constitution Review Group, an eminent body that included two former Attorneys General and a director general of that office, as well as two future superior court judges.  On this issue, the group concluded bluntly that the denominational character of the school system does not accord with the Constitution.  The report states:<\/p><blockquote>The situation is clearly unsatisfactory.  Either Article 44.2.4<sup>o<\/sup>should be changed or the school system must change to accommodate the requirements of Article 44.2.4<sup>o<\/sup>.<\/blockquote><p>Faced with the choice between amending either the Constitution or the school system, that group did not recommend a change to this part of Article 44.2.4<sup>o<\/sup>.  First, it pointed out that the provision was a limited exception to the general constitutional prohibition on the State endowment of religion.  Second, it argued that if Article 44.2.4<sup>o<\/sup>did not provide safeguards for minorities, the State might be in breach of international obligations.  It argued that an amendment would be a retrograde step in the context of Northern Ireland and would send the wrong signal concerning pluralism in the State.  We in the Labour Party accept these arguments.  We are not proposing an amendment to the Constitution but, if the Constitution is not to change, then the education system must change to align itself more closely to what the Constitution requires.  Therefore, denominational education providers must accept that public money is not given unconditionally.  The Constitution imposes requirements.  It requires that every publicly funded school must be prepared, in principle, to accept pupils from denominations other than its own and to have separate secular and religious instruction.  That is not just the Labour Party&rsquo;s position, it is also the position, or very close to it, of most of the parties in the D&aacute;il having regard to the recent general election manifestos.<br\/><br\/>In the spirit of new politics, it is open to the majority in the D&aacute;il this week to progress this Bill through Second Stage and send it on to Committee Stage where we can continue the debate, reach consensus and, finally, make an agreed improvement to the law.  I do not claim that its drafting is perfect or that it covers every conceivable contingency, but Second Stage debate is about accepting the principles and policies of a Bill.  If it is accepted, we can all contribute to improving the Bill on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>I have seen the Government's proposed amendment to the Bill.  I understand the Minister's good intention in this respect but the road to inaction, particularly in this D&aacute;il, is paved with good intentions and, in a way, an excess of talk.  The Government's proposal is that this Bill will only be deemed to be read this time 12 months hence.  It is to be postponed for 12 months.  It would be helpful if we could set a political target for parents because this is about parents, boards of management, teachers and patrons all trying to do the best for the children of the area.  I represent Dublin West where we have the highest level of diversity in the State and where an extraordinary contribution is made by patrons, teachers and parents for the betterment of children.  We as a D&aacute;il should aim to have this legislation in place for the 2017-2018 school year.  It would address the issue in this context of parents having to be involved in baptism where they do not wish to do that.  If they wish to do it, it is a wonderful celebration, but if they do not, there is something false and forced about it.  If this Bill were accepted and we then dealt with it in committee and at pre-legislative scrutiny level, we would then be ready for that timeline.  I urge the Minister, in terms of our Republic, that this is the appropriate thing to do and not to dilly-dally with this for another year.<\/p><p>As this is a precarious D&aacute;il at times, is another year the equivalent of putting it off for three years or more?  I understand that the Minister is well disposed and has engaged very generously in the discussion, but I suggest that he rethink the amendment he proposes, because it puts the matter out of bounds in terms of academic years for several extra years.  I am not sure that is his intention, but it is the consequence of what he proposes.  The Minister also proposes that we sort out so many issues when, in fact, as I think I have outlined in my speech, most of the pertinent issues are addressed in the Bill.  Where they are not, the proposals that have been put forward by the different groups and the parties in their manifestos are capable of being addressed on Committee Stage so that we have the best outcome for all of our children in the diverse society that many of us happily live in now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800046#TT00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467142800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that the Bill be deemed to be read a second time this day twelve months, to allow for scrutiny between now and then by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills and for the Committee to consider submissions and hold hearings that have regard in particular to ensure that:<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) the proposed Bill strikes a balanced and measured approach in relation to competing rights;<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the proposed Bill does not give rise to any unintended consequences that create any adverse impact on the schools of minority denominations;<br \/><br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) the issue of catchment areas for schools will be examined, with due respect to the importance of established geographic boundaries and organisation, as well as having taken into regard experience in other jurisdictions and the views of stakeholders;<br \/><br \/>(<i>d<\/i>) the proposed Bill takes account of any impacts and distortion on school transport policy and provision; and<br \/><br \/>(<i>e<\/i>) the proposed Bill does not give rise to Constitutional difficulties;<\/blockquote>and to fully discuss and explore other practical issues and consequences that may arise as a result of the proposals, and further agrees that the Bill would proceed separately from the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, scheduled to be published by Government this term.&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>I welcome the tabling of the Bill by Deputy Joan Burton.  It is important legislation.  Contrary to what the Deputy inferred, I am keen that progress be made in this area.  I did not say I was not keen to progress the legislation; rather, I have always said I was keen to work with the committee to advance legislation in this sphere.  That is because when the education committee has examined this issue in the past, it recognised that there were difficult legal and constitutional issues that had to be balanced.  This is not a simple issue but a complex one.  None the less, it is important, and I am very keen to progress the work.  That is the spirit in which this amendment is put forward.<\/p><p>I am very keen to progress other areas where choice for parents can be genuinely opened up.  I will push ahead with the admissions Bill, on which a great deal of work was done by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan when she occupied the post I now have.  She did a great deal of good work, including pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Bill did not include a provision of this nature.  There is a lot of established work with which we can progress.  The admissions Bill is well worth pursuing.  It will bring extra clarity and definition to the area and be good for parents.  I am also determined to push ahead with a plan to build on the work of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and her predecessor, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to expand the number of multidenominational schools available in our system.  We have set a target of 400 over 15 years, which will represent a considerable acceleration of the pace of transfer.  Clearly, a great deal of work will go into that.<\/p><p>Deputy Burton rightly pointed out that there are huge numbers of patrons, students and boards out there doing fantastic work.  It is my genuine belief that they deserve the opportunity to attend hearings held by the Oireachtas committee and make their input.  This is an issue that will have an impact on many schools and they need to have a chance to assess it and inform us in the Oireachtas of the potential impact it might have.  There is a strong case to be made that children should not be unreasonably refused access to their local schools.  That has been well articulated by Deputy Burton and others.  In particular, oversubscribed schools should not routinely pass over local children to admit children of their own denominations where those children have options in their own areas.  That is a principle that informed Deputy Burton's Bill.  It is vital that we provide for the consultation that a proposal of this nature involves.  Everyone has recognised that there are legal and constitutional issues, and in her own presentation Deputy Burton picked her way carefully through them to ensure that she respected them.  It is very important that we get the reassurance not just of this debate, which will be short, but of the sort of scrutiny that can occur in committee and that it deserves.<\/p><p>The Bill has raised a number of particular matters that will have to be examined much more closely when we get to the hearings stage.  The Bill relies on a school's catchment to define the area within which preference can be given.  The concept of a catchment has not been used in Irish education legislation and as such it is a new one.  It is not particularly defined in the Bill.  It is certainly arguable that a better approach would be to permit preference for a child where he or she does not have a closer school of the same denomination rather than to define &quot;catchment,&quot; which is a term we have not used in the past and that is not clear, although I think from Deputy Burton's presentation that she envisages that catchments would not be standard things.  Every school would have a different type of catchment which it would presumably define for itself.  That obviously provides scope for creative definitions of &quot;catchment&quot; to allow the continued exclusion of local children.  A school could define a catchment as a whole county or the whole country.  There is an issue that needs to be examined there.  The Bill ties catchment of a particular school with catchment of a particular denomination, which overlooks the practice whereby particular Protestant religions frequently give preference to children of other Protestant traditions even though they are not of the same denomination.  That is a practice with which we should not lightly interfere.<\/p><p>The concept of requiring a religious school to prove, even within its own catchment, that its preference is, in the words of the Bill, essential to ensure reasonable access to children of that denomination within the catchment certainly pushes the issue quite far.  Article 44.2.5&deg; includes the right of religions to organise their own affairs.  Even though the schools are in receipt of public funds, there is an issue with a requirement to prove that it is essential.  Furthermore, the criteria against which the schools would have to prove that case are not set out.  These are issues we need to examine.  I am aware that the existing Equal Status Act uses that phraseology in respect of individual refusals, but the admissions Bill we are promoting will provide that a school that is not oversubscribed cannot refuse entry to any pupil.  We are going beyond the requirement to prove that it was essential to disallow it in those cases.  We need to tease out how the system would work in practice.  One of the things about which we must be careful is the risk of creating a situation in which parents have no choice of school.  We do not want to do that.  We do not want to have parental choice constrained totally by address.  Parents are recognised as the primary educators in our system, and that should be facilitated so that they have as wide a choice as possible.  One of the things I am very keen to do is to expand that choice and to provide more multidenominational schools so that parents can operate their own choice to have their children taught in schools of their own ethos.  That is the best outcome for parents, which is not to say that parents who choose to have a child in a school that is not of their ethos should not be properly accommodated also.<\/p><p>The matter of catchment may also raise issues for boarding schools, which will need consideration.  That is especially so in the context of many Protestant boarding schools, which have very broad catchments.  That is part of their attraction.  The Bill introduces a provision on children who are opting out of religious instruction with regard to some kind of test to prove that preference was essential.  I am not sure I see how those two things are connected.<\/p><p>There are constitutional and, given the education legislation, legal obligations to ensure a child's parents who want to opt out have the facility to do so.<\/p> <p> This is a constrained debate, but I will welcome this legislation in the short time that is available to me.  Our approach of providing a year during which these issues can be teased out will be helpful and allow us to move ahead swiftly, given that we will have worked through complex issues.  If these issues had to be reflected upon and developed solely within the Department without having the opportunity to share that work with Deputies or for the committee to hold hearings with people in a public forum, the preparatory work would not be as well done.  The way in which Deputy Burton and the Labour Party have proposed the Bill has given us an opportunity.  We can push on with the elements relating to, for example, the admissions policy and move to the point at which the D&aacute;il can make decisions on the Bill, which complements some other measures.  The old phrase is, \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\"  There have been many reforming people before me in the Department.  I want to build on their work and not let valuable measures prepared in the previous Oireachtas be lost.<\/p> <p> I hope this offers Deputy Burton some reassurance.  My approach to the Bill is constructive and not in the spirit of St. Augustine.  I have forgotten what he said, but I know the phrase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800048#VV00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467143400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Let him be chaste, but not just yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800049#WW00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1467143400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Exactly.

It seems that, if we have proper consultation on this issue, it will be possible to reach a consensus in the D&aacute;il.  However, I do not see that consensus yet.  For my part, that is primarily because I have not been able to meet all the interested parties.  I have met some impressive lobby groups that made good cases in seeking the repeal of the Equal Status Act and other measures, but this is the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims and I have not been able to meet them as a result.  The Church of Ireland has not been available to meet either, although it sent an urgent message this evening about its concerns with the Bill.  For these reasons among many others, it is essential we take time to consider the Bill and speak to all the interested parties.  They must be heard just like we and the impressive lobby groups that want change for good reasons must.<\/p>  <p>  While Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Government amendment, we would not allow the period to reach one year as a means of delay.  As Deputy O'Loughlin, the incoming Chair of the Committee on Education and Skills, will agree, this issue can be addressed efficiently and must be dealt with properly.  In recent years, time has been wasted on the divestment process, covering only a little of the distance that we must travel on the issues of choice and ethos in schools.  Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut or demanding change without consultation or bringing people along has proven a barrier to change.  A slightly different approach is necessary if we are to bring people with us.  Everyone can see that the arguments are correct.  Fianna F&aacute;il accepts that the treatment of non-Catholic parents and children in the education system is an urgent rights issue and must be addressed quickly.<\/p>  <p>  This situation has resulted from the changes in our society and the ever-increasing mismatch between patronage arrangements and the wishes of parents.  I acknowledge the role of religious organisations in providing education via the national school system.  Some provided it when no other education was available.  While we must remember that some of the people involved shamed that work, I thank the religious overall.  They are not in our schools as much as they used to be.  In general, they did tremendous work for decades when the country had few resources.<\/p>  <p>  The Equal Status Act 2000 prohibited religious discrimination in educational services.  However, it allowed schools to enrol co-religionists in preference to members of other faiths when the schools were oversubscribed.  Some 20% of schools are oversubscribed nationally, but particularly in Dublin.  This has become a live issue.  Having met those parents who cannot get their children into local schools, their case is inarguable to some extent and is one for which I have great sympathy.  This situation has arisen on occasion in County Meath.  I agree with the Minister that our policy while in government, that of providing choice, has worked in some areas.  In Ashbourne and where I live in Meath, one generally has a wide choice of educational providers, for example, Catholic and non-Catholic Gaelscoileanna, Catholic national schools, Educate Together, etc.  This is good and forms part of the solution to the problem.<\/p>  <p>  No parent should have to baptise a child just to get that child into a school.  All children, regardless of religious denomination or outlook, should have access to a school in their local communities.  Every Deputy will agree that this principle should be self-evident.  However, amending section 7 of the Equal Status Act in the manner proposed in the Bill is too simplistic.  As some of the minority faiths that have contacted me today have said, this would endanger the ethoses of minority faith schools.  I do not like the idea of them having to prove that a refusal or admissions policy is necessary to protect their ethoses.  The Minister has outlined the constitutional difficulties with it.  While I will not go into the detail, this approach would invite court decisions, which would not be right when the issue can be addressed in a better way.<\/p>  <p>  We favour the introduction of selection criteria for oversubscribed schools based on locality and catchment while recognising that children of a particular faith are entitled to attend a school of that faith.  The Bill does not address the so-called baptism issue in school admissions properly.  Proving an admissions policy is difficult.  Going through the question at the committee of what would be required to protect ethos would be useful.  Ethos is difficult to define.  There is a Catholic ethos, but some schools have different Catholic ethoses.  Educate Together has its own ethos and, although it has been in existence since the 1970s, we have only become more aware of it in our communities in the past 15 years or so.  What is ethos and what needs to be protected?<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il's policy refers to catchment areas, but I would be the first to admit that this issue needs to be examined.  I agree with the Labour Party and disagree with the Minister that catchment areas will form part of the solution to the issue, as schools should have catchment areas.  There must be a way of allocating resources fairly.  We must work out what catchment areas are.  I am unsure as to whether I agree with the Labour Party's approach of letting a school decide, since a school could apply an especially broad catchment area.  I am unsure whether the State should get involved in parish boundaries.  We should stay away from that if we can.  However, we must have a way of recognising catchment areas.  Some schools include catchment areas in their admission policies and there are bus catchment areas and so on, but this matter has not been properly examined by the State to date.  Deputy O'Loughlin's committee will have to consider it to provide guidance for us.<\/p>  <p>  We have only received brief legal advice on the Bill, as it was published last week, but we believe there will be constitutional issues with it.  I say this in good faith.  The Labour Party issued a statement on Monday asserting that this was the new politics and it would consult other parties about the Bill.<\/p><p>Quite frankly, there was no consultation.  Although I met Deputy Burton and, in fairness, had a fruitful conversation with her, it was very much off the cuff.  We just bumped into each other.  It was a worthwhile conversation but it would not strike me as consultation.  I do not wish to be too critical on the issue but believe that if I had this Bill before the House, I would certainly be canvassing opinion across all sides rather than simply going in for a D&aacute;il debate.  Canvassing opinion would have been worthwhile because we could have expressed some of our concerns on the Bill, perhaps at an earlier stage.  In any event, this can be done by the education committee, and it needs to be done by that committee.  We believe the Bill requires further scrutiny before it passes through Second Stage.  The problem with simply passing Second Stage today is that the Bill will just proceed to Committee Stage, which traditionally does not provide for consultation or for people to come in to give evidence.  It simply involves a line-by-line examination of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800049#WW00500","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467144000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>We could change that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800050#XX00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>We could change things but it would be better to opt for pre-legislative scrutiny before engaging in line-by-line scrutiny.  Line-by-line scrutiny is pedantic; it is about words and their meaning.  The issues are too big to be dealt with simply by addressing definitions.  We really need to examine broader issues such as catchment and ethos.  We should explore on the public record why this issue is of particular importance to minority-faith schools.  As I stated, I have not been able to consult representatives of at least two minority faiths, and I am sure the other parties have not been able to do so either since this Bill was published.  It would be wrong to proceed without consultation.<\/p>  <p>  The concerns I am addressing with regard to this Bill and the issues I am raising in disagreeing with it are entirely predicated in the first instance on the Constitution and, second, on the protection of the rights of minority faiths.  This is a matter we must take seriously as a country.  It is not a matter we have taken seriously over the decades.  The Church of Ireland community, in particular, was not always treated fairly by this State.  At the very least, its views on this matter must be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  When one notes all the issues concerning race that are bubbling up in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries, including Ireland, one must conclude that the views of the Muslim community must be taken seriously.  If it is to see us as seriously trying to integrate it into society and communicate with it, the passage of a Bill like this, which may affect it, must involve consultation.  I have not yet spoken to representatives of the Muslim community so I have yet to obtain their views.  I presume the legislation does affect them; they have only two schools.  Their views will be very important if we are to demonstrate seriousness of intent.  I have not had the opportunity to consult the Muslim community, nor has the D&aacute;il, because we are currently in the month of Ramadan.<\/p>  <p>  I am absolutely confident that the D&aacute;il will reach consensus.  I sincerely hope it will be achieved by the autumn and that we can have our consultations.  The education committee will not be busy with legislation in the way the justice and finance committees might be.  Therefore, we will have time to deal with this issue and get this right in a relatively short period.  Having this legislation ready for September 2017 is and should be an attainable ambition.  I agree with Deputy Burton fully that this needs to be dealt with by then.  I am absolutely confident that a consensus will emerge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800050#XX00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>We should not say 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800050#XX00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Let us not have a conversation about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800050#XX00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>On the period of 12 months-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800050#XX00600","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>New politics, a Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800050#XX00700","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>That is what is being presented here.

What is being proposed by the Labour Party tonight is far short of what is required.<\/p>  <p>  The Equal Status Act 2000 was very progressive legislation brought in by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  It brought an end to many issues of discrimination that were still present in our society.  Any measure that further improves equal status is one of which I am very supportive.  It is imperative that any alteration to section 7(3) of the Equal Status Act not put Christian or minority-faith families in a disadvantaged position when sending their children to school.  This Bill has the potential to do that.  In saying that, the wording of section 7(3) of the Equal Status Act 2000 does need to be updated.  It needs to be reformed rather than removed.  When places are available in any given school, they should be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis.  The process should take into account the locality of the family.  Religion should not be the determining factor in these circumstances.  The Labour Party Bill does make provision for this.<\/p>  <p>  In essence, schools do not have to provide justification for turning away students of a particular religion if they claim to be oversubscribed.  This is wrong and is correctly amended in the Labour Party Bill.  The principle behind this Bill is correct but it is too simplistic.  I agree that the selection criteria for entry into schools should not be based on whether a child has been baptised.  Every child should have the opportunity to attend his or her local school regardless of religion.  However, every school has the right to defend its ethos.  Minority-faith schools will also lose the right to defend their ethos if section 7 of the Equal Status Act is simply removed.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of schools are already doing a good job in caring for children of different cultural and religious backgrounds.  The teaching of different faiths and religions forms part of the religious curriculum in our schools while allowing schools to protect their ethos.  The Bill gives neither majority- nor minority-faith schools the protection they require.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill allows us to begin a discussion on how best to approach the issue of access to our schools.  If there is an issue with schools turning students away on the basis of religion when oversubscribed, it affords us an opportunity to discuss how best we can overcome it while protecting both the family and the ethos of the schools.  However, the Bill is too vague and does not legislate correctly for this complex issue.  Fundamental matters need to be resolved before the Bill can progress any further.<\/p>  <p>  It is ironic that the Labour Party is now trying to alter the flaws in our education system despite having held office in the Department of Education and Skills for five years, during which it made no attempt to resolve the issue we are now discussing.

Every child going through our education system should be treated and cherished equally.  No child should be isolated because of his or her religion, lack of religion, race, colour or background.  Our education system, which is publicly funded, must be equally accessible to all children.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the treatment of non-Catholic parents and children in our education system, there is definitely an urgent rights issue.  I say this as somebody who was educated by the Sisters of Mercy not only at primary and secondary levels but also at third level, in Carysfort College.  I also taught in a faith-based school.  There is an ever-increasing mismatch between the current patronage arrangements for national schools and the wishes of parents.  It is important to note that 96% of national schools are under denominational patronage.  Surveys have found that only one in four parents would actually pick such a school if he or she had a choice.  This is the reality we face.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt about the principle of this Bill and I believe it is extremely well meant.

Currently, catchment areas are not enshrined in legislation, nor are they a statutory requirement in admissions policies.  Any solution to the issue of admissions will require enshrining some form of catchment area in school admissions policies.  Specifically, schools should not be able to admit children of the same denomination as the school who live outside the catchment area in preference to children of a different denomination from inside the catchment area.  This is a key point on which I believe we all agree.<\/p> <p> My party colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, addressed the issue of protecting minority faith schools, as did Deputy Joan Burton.  Fianna F&aacute;il proposes that catchment areas for minority faith schools be sized according to the availability of schools of a different ethos.  It is unlikely that this proposal could be perceived as unconstitutional.  It would mean that catchment areas could be sized according to the prevalence of the school ethos, for example, Presbyterian, Jewish and Muslim schools would need to have wide catchment areas for admissions.  In such circumstances, a child from outside the catchment area would not be considered for a school place before a child from the local area, even if the local child is not of the denominated religion of the school or of no religion.  <\/p> <p> I acknowledge the role Educate Together has played in helping to solve the admissions problem.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the organisation's ongoing involvement in the patronage of schools.  All schools should be multi-faith in their enrolment policies and education practices, albeit under different patrons. <\/p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Party in government introduced a community national school model in 2007.  This model should play an increasing role as new schools are opened and others are transferred from Catholic patronage.  Any large-scale movement of schools from Catholic Church patronage should be planned carefully, however, to avoid significant disruption and a possible decline in educational standards in schools.  A gradual transition in the patronage arrangements of schools is vital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800050#XX01000","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467144600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Deputies Carol Nolan and Maurice Quinlivan have seven minutes' speaking time.

I am glad Deputies have an opportunity to address it in the Chamber.  Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000, which has been interpreted to allow schools to discriminate between students on the grounds of religion, has been roundly condemned by campaign groups and teachers' unions, including the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Teachers Union of Ireland.  In 2011, the UN Human Rights Council recommended that Ireland eliminate religious discrimination in access to education.  The Ombudsman for Children has also recommended that the relevant legislative provision be amended. <\/p>  <p>  While I appreciate that the vast majority of schools operate fair admissions policies and do their best to accommodate all children, discrimination in admissions policies has become an issue in some areas, particularly where schools are over-subscribed.  Unfortunately, it is not only in the area of religion that children face barriers in terms of access to education.  A problem also arises in respect of children with special educational needs who often face a variety of soft barriers in accessing their local school, an issue highlighted recently by the National Council for Special Education.  It is my understanding that this issue will be addressed in the upcoming admissions legislation due to be published by the Government.  I and my colleagues look forward to engaging to ensure that children with special educational needs can access education on an equal footing with their peers.  <\/p>  <p>  While I broadly support the sentiments behind the Bill, I also have a number of concerns.  The legislation appears to retain the right of denominational schools in receipt of State funding to give preference to pupils of that denomination in terms of access to education.  While this is no doubt an attempt to overcome potential constitutional issues and secure the maximum possible political support for the Bill, it is an issue of serious concern.  It is a sad reflection on this House that in 2016 we cannot simply give effect to the right of every child to receive an education without facing any form of discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in position is that the right to education is a fundamental human right and every child should be able to access his or her local State-funded school on an equal footing and without discrimination, including discrimination based on disability or religion.  Sinn F&eacute;in has campaigned heavily on this issue and last year produced a Bill that would eradicate discrimination in access to education.  In that regard, I commend my predecessor as Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on education, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, on the hard work he did on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's support for the Bill is qualified.  My party would like the issue to be debated thoroughly and the views of all stakeholders taken into account.  We appreciate there is a need to examine the constitutional workings of an amendment to the Equal Status Act in respect of the rights of all children and their parents to practise their beliefs.  We would like an opportunity to further examine this issue on Committee Stage, with a view to developing a position that ensures the constitutional rights of every child are balanced in a fair and equitable manner.  The State has an obligation to ensure the rights of all children are protected and it must take action to ensure this is the case.  My fear is that this Bill will not achieve this objective.  For this reason, we will seek to amend it on Committee Stage to ensure the most robust possible protection is in place for all children.  I look forward to working with all my colleagues on this issue and making the most of this genuine opportunity to ensure equal access to education for each and every child in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800051#YY00500","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>While Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill, in light of serious concerns expressed by a significant percentage of the population on this issue, we believe the legislation does not go far enough.  As such, this is disappointing and a lost opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  There is little doubt that the issue of school admissions has become extremely controversial.  We are dealing with the legacy of an institutional structure and a mindset from a bygone era that is not fit for purpose in modern Ireland.  In 21st century Ireland, we have a society that is racially, ethnically and ideologically diverse.  In terms of religious affiliation, we have people in communities of all persuasions and none.  The question for the State and its institutions is how to manage this diversity while at the same time ensuring equality of access for all.  In education, particularly primary education, achieving this balance has proved problematic for the State thus far.  In large part, this failure is due to the unwillingness of successive Governments to take control of the national school system, which is, after all, funded by taxpayers, and their failure to challenge powerful vested interests.  The reluctance to tackle this issue once and for all has produced the chaos, confusion and anger that have become evident in public discourse on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The State has a duty to act in the best interests of all children.  The only way to achieve this is through the introduction of a secular, public primary education system.  While this Bill makes a positive contribution towards achieving this goal, it does not go far enough.  We live in a complex world and the current admissions system is not sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the Educate Together campaign which has done fantastic work in the area of school admissions.  Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to pursue this issue until we have a State-run primary school system that in practice and ethos is open to all children, irrespective of religious affiliation, race, class or ability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800051#YY00600","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Deputy Mick Barry has seven and a half minutes' speaking time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800051#YY00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I expected the Ceann Comhairle to give me a few extra minutes as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800051#YY00800","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>We will stick to the schedule.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800051#YY00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467144600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I welcome the parents in the Gallery who have been campaigning for change and justice on this issue.  The current practice in respect of school admissions and the teaching of religion in schools is at odds with the views and aspirations of the majority of the population.<\/p><p>According to a poll conducted on behalf of Equate, a total of 87% agreed that the State should ensure children do not experience religious discrimination during the school day, while 84% agreed that reforms should be carried out to ensure no child is excluded from education on the basis of whether he or she is religious or non-religious, as the case may be.<br\/><br\/>Some 96% of primary schools are controlled by religious organisations and 90% are controlled by the Catholic Church.  This means that those who are not Catholic face the greatest problems.  Muslims, Hindus, those from other Christian denominations and those with no religion face serious difficulties accessing local schools.  Children live beside and play with neighbouring children but because of the religion of their parents, they are separated when going to school.  In all other aspects of life, Ireland has diversity in religion and cultural backgrounds.  We see this in the workplace, sports clubs and communities but not in schools, which remain segregated according to the religious backgrounds of children's parents.<br\/><br\/>The experience and testimony of parents with children trying to get into schools is stark.  The Education Equality organisation has supplied the Anti-Austerity Alliance and other parties with testimony from parents.  I have before me several quotes and I will read three into the record.  A woman said: <\/p><blockquote>The experience has caused significant stress and anxiety for our family, for a prolonged duration of time.  My husband and I have been under enormous pressure to baptise our son against or conscience in order to secure a school place for him.<\/blockquote><p>The second quote is from another parent:<\/p><blockquote>Our daughter is bottom of the list in our local schools, as they are religious ethos schools even though they are state funded ... Our friends have had their children baptised to 'jump the queue' even though they are not religious.  We don't want to have to do this.<\/blockquote><p>The final quote is from a man who says:<\/p><blockquote>My daughter was born in Ireland.  I was finding it impossible to get a school place for her ... I got a call from the office of Arch Bishop enquiring about the problem ... He offered me a solution: &ldquo;To make your daughter&rsquo;s admission easy and quick, why don't you baptise her?&quot;... I was furious ...<\/blockquote><p>He was right to be furious.  Those words ring clear and true to me.  They stand in some contrast to the weasel words we have heard in the House tonight from Deputies who say that they support the Bill, that they believe it is progressive and a step in the right direction but that they are not going to vote for it.  That is simply not good enough.<br\/><br\/>The experience of these parents and others who have been in contact with the Anti-Austerity Alliance Deputies shows that their rights are not vindicated by the State.  Their right to choose religion or not to have a religion is not respected.  According to the Equate survey, one person in five is aware of someone who has had his or her child baptised to help the child to get access to the local school.  The right of a parent not to have his or her child attend religious instruction is not a reality under the current arrangement.  The right of children to education is not respected, as children must travel past their local school to go to another school.  Furthermore, there are examples of children not getting access to school and having to postpone the start of primary education.<br\/><br\/>It is not only parents who are taking issue with religious discrimination in schools; the United Nations takes the same view.  This year the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child called on the State to change the laws in respect of school admissions and how religion is integrated into the school day.<br\/><br\/>I am going to be caught for time.

It contends that the State is obliged to maintain a situation whereby the interests of religious institutions are placed ahead of the right of freedom of religion, the right to access education and the right to opt out of religious instruction.  We do not agree with this interpretation of the constitutional position.  There is no absolute right on the part of religious organisations to discriminate, especially when they are receiving State funds to provide the State's education system.  Constitutionally, the Oireachtas is allowed to legislate to set a balance between competing rights.  There is no constitutional prohibition on the Oireachtas ending religious discrimination in school admissions and directing schools to have religious instruction at the end of the school day after core school hours.  The only thing lacking is the political will of the establishment parties to implement legislative change that would displease the Roman Catholic Church.  Let us suppose the constitutional position did not allow for the necessary legislation.  If the Government were serious, it would bring forward a constitutional amendment and hold a referendum to ensure education equality.  If the Government did this, it would be supported by voters strongly.<\/p>  <p>  The Anti-Austerity Alliance welcomes the Bill because it would lead to a dilution of the current wording of section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act.  The Labour Party Bill would essentially change the pecking order in school admissions policies by allowing local children not of the religion of the school second priority after local children of the religion of the school.  This would be a slight improvement but it is still insufficient and it is not what the hundreds of parents who are campaigning on this issue are seeking.  The Labour Party Bill also legislates for due regard to be afforded to vindicating the rights of those not taking part in religious instruction.  However, the parts of the Education Act that make this difficult in practice will stay on the books.<\/p>  <p>  The Socialist Party and the Anti-Austerity Alliance advocate for complete separation of church and State.  We do not believe the State should interfere in people's religion and we do not believe the teachings of religion should inform State laws.  Religious organisations should not run State services in education and health.  Such services should be well funded by the State, open to all and run democratically.  Although we will be voting for this Bill on Thursday, we remain committed to reintroducing the Equal Participation in Schools Bill in the coming weeks.  If the Labour Party Bill is passed, we will bring forward amendments on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>  <p>  There should also be changes in legislation, in particular, section 30 of the Education Act, to end the current position of the Minister having to be deferential to school patrons.  Our Bill would require religious instruction to take place at the end of the school day after core school hours.  We encourage parents and all those interested in equality to continue their campaigning work.  We encourage people to attend the Education Equality gathering for change this coming Sunday at 3 p.m. in St. Stephen's Green.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1467145200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>We will move on to the Independents 4 Change.

I welcome the sentiment behind the Bill but I do not believe it will achieve the change we need.  Our international obligations have already been cited.  As has been said, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has recommended that Ireland amend the existing legislative framework to eliminate discrimination in school admissions, including amendment of the Equal Status Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Ombudsman for Children has recommended change.  The Ombudsman's office reviewed material on our UN obligations dating back to a 2006 review of Ireland's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  That review recommended a change in the admissions framework and so on.  The review also examines our monitoring of the international covenant on civil and political rights.  Again, the recommendation was to remove discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party is trying to change something without changing it in any real sense.  I see the difficulty the Labour Party faces in this regard.  There is a strong lobby not to change.  However, as was the case during the election, the Labour Party and the previous coalition Government were somewhat out of touch with the views of people.  The surveys we have seen support the views of the people to whom we have talked who are demanding change to ensure we do not discriminate against children.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and Skills has said there will be more schools, and I welcome this.  He has set a figure of 400 additional schools within a certain timeframe.  However, that does not resolve the problem.  While it will give choice, it does not sort out the problem.  Let us suppose a small area has only one school.  How does someone there who does not want to attend religion class or go to a school with the religious ethos of that school manage?  How do we give that child and her parents rights under the Constitution?<\/p><p>In fairness, the former Minister, Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn, set out on a positive road to try to divest schools of patronage.  However, the progress has been extremely slow and I understand only eight schools have divested themselves of religious patronage.  We have a historical legacy with 96% of the schools run by religious denominations.  However, people have moved on.  While I value religion, I also value the right of a child to attend a school without having to participate in religious education.<\/p> <p> I do not believe the amendment in the Bill will deal with the complexities of what we are facing.  We need to look at it and grasp it in order that we treat all children equally.  We give rights to children who want a religious education and we cite the Constitution to back up those rights.  However, we cite the Constitution only as an obstacle when it comes to children who do not want that type of education.  One cannot pick and choose from the Constitution to suit one's argument.<\/p> <p> The Constitution sets out rights entitling people to education and entitling them to practise their religion.  However, there is no constitutional right that we would give public funding to a school that will only admit children of certain religions.  The Equal Status Act should have addressed the problem at the time, but it did not and that is why we have a problem.  It allowed an exception that it should not have allowed at the time.  The UN had already indicated we were not meeting our obligations in 2000 and yet we introduced the Equal Status Act.  Clearly the Government at the time did not have the courage to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800052#ZZ00700","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467145800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>The Bill appears to attempt to deal with the issue of discrimination on religious grounds when it comes to admission to schools.  It looks on first reading of the Bill that there is a right to attend a school and opt out of religious education, which the school must facilitate, but the Bill appears to place the onus on parents to assert that right.<\/p><p>The second amendment to section 7 of the 2000 Act is explained as giving effect to the principle that if a local State-funded school is the only reasonably available school for a child, &quot;religious education in that school must be severable&quot;, meaning religious education must take place outside the classroom.  My concern is that this section appears to place a parent in a situation of conflict with the school to assert that right.  Many parents would not want to be in that situation, and why should they have to be?  The State as the body that delivers on the right of all children to receive an education should ensure religious education in all publicly funded schools is severable.<\/p><p>This week EQUATE published a commissioned opinion on the constitutionality of reforming section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000.  Opinion from three constitutional law experts agrees that the church has no constitutional right to unconditional public funding for private or denominational schools and that the Constitution permits the imposition of reasonable conditions on the provision of public funding.  While it found that the outright repeal of the section may be open to challenge in that this may be seen as excessive interference with the management by religious denominations of their own affairs within private religious institutions, it also stated in its opinion that an amendment of the section could be made in order that it cannot be relied on by publicly funded schools.  It would not prevent religious denominations from operating discriminatory admissions policies in private religious institutions but solely make the provision of public funding to such institutions conditional upon non-discriminatory admissions policies.<\/p><p>The courts in dealing with attempts by the Oireachtas to reconcile competing constitutional rights have established a strong presumption of constitutionality.  This means there is a presumption that the Oireachtas has considered the competing rights and has attempted to strike a balance.  The Labour Party in this Bill has relied heavily on the Constitutional Review Group report from 1996 which is 20 years old now.  I believe the opinion from EQUATE is more up to date and deals with recent case law.<\/p><p>For most families outside of Dublin and the major urban areas there is no choice in what school to send their children to.

While our local school did not and does not insist on children having been baptised to attend, the current system would allow it to and that needs to change.<\/p><p>I would be inclined to support the Bill, but only on the condition that it could be amended substantially in committee.  I note that the Government wants the Bill to pass Second Stage in 12 months' time, which is too long.  Surely the committee could consider it much sooner.  I am not sure how the Minister wants to achieve it.  It might be worthwhile to have that discussion in committee, but at the end of the process we must have legislation that means no school can discriminate on religious grounds against any child.  I believe that is what we must achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800053#AAA00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1467145800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to speak on this Bill.

That is all I can speak for.  Throughout the years I have served on boards of management of a primary school and a new community college, including setting up that college involving the amalgamation of three schools.  Those people must be saluted and complimented on how they operated in difficult circumstances and dealt with calls for change.  They are dealing with change.<\/p>  <p>  We need to make haste slowly.  We need to look back to where we had local plebiscites on divestment of schools some years ago.  There were very mixed reactions.  In many areas it was not made clear to them what they were voting on and there were low turnouts.  We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater.<\/p>  <p>  There are some good points in the Bill and I compliment the Labour Party on introducing it.  We need a reasonable and reasoned debate.  The timeframe of 12 months is not unreasonable.  We must bring it before the Committee on Education and Skills and it would be important to have public hearings because this has serious ramifications.  We do not want to victimise any of the minority faith schools that have been operating under pressure, including some small rural schools in my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  There are other areas that are also very serious.  Under the closed school rule, families are being divided.  I have been contacted regularly by parents with two or three children in a primary school, and under this rule, based on measurements from satnav, the eye in the sky or whatever, they find they might be a couple of hundred metres nearer to a different school.  That has serious implications because the family is divided and there might not be a seat on the school bus, if they get the bus, to get to the school they always went to.  It causes huge inconvenience.  It is difficult enough for any family to deal with getting their children enrolled in a school.  I sympathise with people who have difficulty in getting enrolled for reasons of faith and so on.  That should not be happening and, thankfully, it is not happening in my constituency as far as I am aware.

I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on his new portfolio.  I am sure it will be no problem to him, as he has served in many other Ministries.<\/p><p>I have to say we do not have discrimination issues in Kerry, Killarney or Tralee.  We have people of many different religious denominations attending our national schools and secondary schools.  We do not have any issues.  I am not aware of them anyway.  I have to salute our boards of management and parents' councils for the good work they continue to do to ensure our children are properly seen after.  We have no discrimination in Kerry of which I am aware.  That is what I have to say.<\/p> <p> We certainly have problems in other areas of the school system.  Going back the years, if a school closed in an area the Department of Education and Skills gave an undertaking - a written undertaking in many cases - to transport the children of the locality to the central school in the parish free of charge.  Sadly, the Department has reneged on that promise or consideration on many occasions.  This has hurt many people in rural parishes and caused a great deal of expense for those who now have to bring their children four or five miles - in some cases, the school is six or seven miles away - to school each morning and evening.  If a national school bus run does not have ten children, it will not qualify under the free transport scheme.  I believe this is unfair, especially as the Department of Education and Skills previously gave an undertaking to transport such children to school free of charge.<\/p> <p> I would like to mention an issue that was raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath.  I refer to cases in which the older children in a family are attending a school that traditionally has been attended by members of the family in question.  Three or four years ago, some bright spark decided that such children should have to attend a nearer school on the basis of a satnav or whatever.  It is unfair that the younger children in this family, who would normally have been accompanied to school by their older siblings, now have to go to a different school.  I believe all the children in such a family should be entitled to go to the school that was traditionally attended by their family and all the families around them.  It is wrong that they are divided and separated now.  This change hurt many parents when it was made three or four years ago.<\/p> <p> The school transport system needs to cater for all our children, but that is not happening at present.  I will give an example.  In some cases, a parent needs to have a medical card in order for his or her child to qualify for free school transport.  If one parent has a medical card but the other parent does not, their children are denied free school transport.  It is very unfair that families in such circumstances have pay &euro;350 for a school transport ticket for each of their children because many of them can ill afford such an expense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800053#AAA00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467146400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>We will move on to the Social Democrats-Green Party grouping.

I welcome this Bill because I strongly believe we need to reform fundamentally the schools admission practices in all State-funded schools and ensure equality of access, participation and opportunity in our schools.  While what is proposed in this Bill is preferable to the current system, it does not go far enough.  What is required is quite simple: no State-funded school should be able to discriminate for or against a child on the basis of his or her religion.  How can it be fair that a child who lives right beside a school and whose name was the first to be placed on the admissions list can miss out on a place because he or she is not of the preferred religion?  Of course there is a place for freedom of religion and religious schools in Ireland.  This should be both recognised and respected, but not in an exclusive way.  Taxpayers&rsquo; money should not be funding discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  Our children are growing up in a worrying time.  This worry is caused not just by the external existential threat of climate change, but also by the much more frightening human threats of hate, fear, anger, intolerance and violence.  In recent times, we have seen the rise of far-right nationalism in Europe, the nomination of Donald Trump as a candidate for the Presidency of the USA and the anti-immigration rhetoric that fuelled large parts of the ultimately successful \"Leave\" campaign in the Brexit referendum.  All of this leaves me more concerned for our children's future than I have ever been before.  It has left me with an even stronger conviction that we must fight this fear with courage, this anger with love and this hate with tolerance.  We must defeat exclusion and alienation with inclusivity in everything we do, including how we educate our children.<\/p>  <p>  The most valuable lesson any child can learn is that of respect and love for all the people around him or her, regardless of their ethnicity, their religion, the language they speak or where they are from.  No danger is greater to our children than the danger of isolation and insulation.  It is a great tragedy if a child cannot encounter other children who come from different backgrounds, cultures, points of view, ways of life or religious beliefs.  A child who cannot interact with the wonderful diversity of our country and our world to the fullest possible extent is a child whose childhood is not as rich as it should be.  Our schools are where our children make friends.  While the religious ethos of so many of our schools is helping to shape the good values of the people of our country, no child should be denied a possible friend because he or she prays in a different way, or he or she does not pray at all.<\/p>  <p>  In saying this, I acknowledge the huge contribution made by the religious to education over hundreds of years.  They were often the only educators who were playing an invaluable role at home and abroad.  They are renowned throughout the world.  In years gone by, they provided education in a voluntary capacity, and at times at great risk to their own lives.  We must also acknowledge, embrace and cater for a changing modern society in which all our children are treated equally when it comes to education.  Religious discrimination has no place in modern society.  All schools in receipt of State funding should be fair, transparent and inclusive in their admissions policies.  Discrimination on the basis of religion would not be tolerated in any other walk of life and the education system should be no different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800054#BBB00300","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1467146400,"counter":345,"content":"<p>It is important to say at the outset that if this Bill is passed as it currently stands, it will not end religious discrimination in our schools.  The purpose of this Bill has been cited in media reports as \"seeking an amendment to the Equal Status Act to allow equal access to Catholic schools whether baptised or not\".  It has to be said that this Bill would do nothing of the sort.  It would retain on the Statute Book the legal discrimination against children in circumstances where there is a shortage of local school places for children who share the same religion as that of the school patron.  It blatantly puts the interests of the Catholic Church ahead of the interests of children.  That is still a Catholics-first policy in anybody's book.  Such a policy is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Democrats want to see section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000 abolished, especially for publicly funded schools.  There are various opinions on whether this is constitutionally possible.  I am aware that Equate recently got an opinion from three senior counsel.  I know that Education Equality also received legal advice as well.  According to all of that advice, it is possible and constitutionally acceptable to abolish or seriously amend section 7(3)(c) of the 2000 Act.  We believe the right course of action at this point would be to test the constitutionality of the abolition of section 7(3)(c).  We should proceed not with this Bill, but with legislation to abolish section 7(3)(c).  We should let that legislation be tested in the Supreme Court and if we need a referendum, so be it.<\/p>  <p>  Even in its limited provisions, the Bill before us lacks clarity.  For example, it does not define the term \"catchment area\".  If schools are defining their own catchment areas, what is to stop them from simply broadening the area to facilitate non-local people who are co-religious over local people who are non-religious?<\/p><p>Neither does the Bill define reasonable access.  Who gets to decide what constitutes reasonable access, for example?<br\/><br\/>The Government proposal is not a solution either.  A 12-month delay on this issue is simply a long-fingering exercise.  It will mean children enrolling this coming year will continue to face serious discrimination.  Moreover, children enrolling for the next school year will face that discrimination also.<br\/><br\/>We have dwelled far too long on this issue.  It cannot be right on any level that State-funded schools can continue to discriminate against children on religious grounds.  Doing nothing suits those in favour of the <i>status quo<\/i>just fine.  However, with every enrolment year that goes by, yet another cohort of young children are turned away at their local schools.  As legislators, we should be ashamed that we allow that to happen to four and five-year old citizens.  This Bill does little to address this discrimination.  It is pretending to be something it is not.  It is not even a good start.  If passed, it would stall real reform for years.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to ensure our public education system reflects and respects the diversity of modern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800054#BBB00400","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467147000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that, by and large, there is general appreciation of the Bill's contents, with the exception of the last speaker.

In that sense, I am disappointed the Government has tabled an amendment to the Bill&rsquo;s passage.  While I welcome the fact the Minister has said he is willing to publish the admissions Bill in this term, I do not see any reason the two Bills could not go side by side.  It is particularly disappointing the Government tabled an amendment to the Second Stage passage of this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  This is an effort by the Labour Party to make more incremental progress on these issues, which require measured balance.  When in government, the Labour Party has always addressed issues of equality.  When Dick Spring became T&aacute;naiste in 1992, he gave equality a place at the Cabinet table.  The then Minister, Mervyn Taylor, initiated the Employment Equality Act and started work on the Equal Status Act.  Those two Acts formed the bedrock of progress on eradicating discrimination across many areas of Irish life.  When we came back into government in 2011, we addressed many equality issues, the most obvious being the referendum on marriage equality, which the people, thankfully in their wisdom, opened their hearts to and made a reality.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress was also made in the education area.  My predecessor, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, when he became Minister for Education and Skills in 2011, established the forum on patronage and pluralism.  As a result of its recommendations, a system of consulting parents was established wherever a new school was to be provided.  This resulted in most of the new schools established since 2011 being multidenominational.  He also initiated the divestment programme, which we all acknowledge has gone slower than we would have wanted.  However, it did get the support of patrons, including the Catholic Church and the Archbishop of Dublin, in particular, showed leadership on this.  It ran into difficulty at local level.  When I was Minister, I met with the various patron bodies to see if we could untangle some of these difficulties.  I know the Minister has committed to continuing that work, which I welcome.  There has been a 43% increase in the number of multidenominational schools and a 54% increase in the number of children attending such schools since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  When I became Minister, I revoked rule 68 which placed religious instruction as the most important subject in schools, irrespective of their ethos.  I wish the Minister well in achieving the targets he has set out in increasing diversity in our schools.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton outlined the background to this Bill both in terms of the constitutional provisions and the historic development of schools in Ireland.  There is a balance to be achieved.  What emerged was not the original intention when the national school system was first set up in the 1830s.  In this area, one makes progress incrementally.  It is not a system that can be turned around overnight.  There are issues of ownership, apart from anything else.<\/p>  <p>  The one issue we are concerned about and want to address is that of parents baptising their children into a religion in which they do not believe.  There is something fundamentally wrong about that.  This Bill is drafted to address the reason some parents feel forced to take such a course.  While all parties agree this is wrong, I have not heard any other practical suggestions in the debate on how to deal with this.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy Shortall that this Bill is not doing anything.  It is putting in a provision whereby denominational schools cannot give preference to children of that denomination outside the catchment area ahead of other children in the catchment area who are not of that denomination.  It is not true to say the Bill is not doing anything progressive.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that 80% of schools are not oversubscribed and, therefore, the issue does not arise for parents applying to those schools.  From my experience, there are Catholic denominational schools, many of them in the poorer parts of our cities which are great at being inclusive with up to 30 different nationalities and a wide variety of faiths.  However, the problem is where the demand exceeds the number of places.  The current situation allows for a school&rsquo;s admissions policy to give priority to children of the denomination of the school who live outside the catchment area ahead of local children of other denominations or none.  This is where the baptism of convenience issue arises.<\/p>  <p>  Catchment does not automatically mean the local parish.  In the case of a minority religion, it could, in some cases, cover several counties.  It could also specify other like-minded churches.  An example was given by the Minister of a Church of Ireland school which takes in Presbyterians and Methodists.  This could also be specified within the admissions policy of the particular school.  We want to make it absolutely clear that this Bill is carefully drafted to respect and protect the right of minority religions to protect the ethos of their schools.  If section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act were abolished, it would not protect the ethos of minority schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800055#CCC00400","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1467147000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>It would kill them off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800055#CCC00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1467147000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>That is the issue we have identified if this section were simply abolished.

However, I urge them to support the Bill, which is designed to bring fairer access for children to their local school and to develop on the progress that has already been made in regard to making Ireland a more inclusive place for children, irrespective of their background.  Deputy Catherine Martin expressed very well the need to do that in the broader context of attitudes which are hardening in various parts of the world, including Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Children benefit from meeting and getting to know classmates from various backgrounds and religions.  Diversity in our schools is an opportunity for our society, not something we should feel threatened by.  For that reason, it is very disappointing that the Government is deciding to kick this down the road for 12 months.  This is not new politics; it is a &quot;do nothing&quot; D&aacute;il.  We have seen other examples of issues being kicked down the road and not decided upon.  I again urge the Government to re-think that timescale, particularly as the admissions Bill is to be brought forward early.  We do not need this broader consultation because we can do that within the committee on Committee Stage.  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism has already engaged very widely on this issue under an independent chairman.  I believe this is to put off something we need to do right now for the parents of children who are right now worried they will not be able to get their child into the local school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800055#CCC00600","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467147600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions to an interesting debate on what is an important and complex issue.  The basic aim of the Government is to use our economic success to create a fair and compassionate society and, ultimately, to make life a little easier for people.  A key part of this is making it easier for parents and children to access more easily local schools which reflect their values and needs.  Therefore, we are taking two major steps to deliver on this.  First, as the Minister, Deputy Bruton, said, we are publishing and enacting a new admissions Bill which will reform the process of school admissions, including banning waiting lists and admission fees, and requiring more information and consultation for parents throughout the process.  Second, we will increase the rate of delivering the new multidenominational and non-denominational schools to reach a total of 400 such schools by 2030.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is currently developing a plan to deliver on this.<\/p>  <p>  We also recognise we need to deal with the situation whereby some religious schools, when they are oversubscribed, admit children of their own religion from some distance away ahead of children of other religions or no religion who live close by.  That is why we are supporting the principle of the Labour Party Bill.  It is important, of course, to remember that only 20% of schools are oversubscribed and, therefore, the vast majority of schools are unaffected by this issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the debate there is broad consensus that children should have access to their local schools and that this is particularly important at primary level.  However, it is also clear from the discussion on this matter that the amendments proposed by Labour involve significant legal, constitutional and operational issues.  Given the complexity of the issues at play and the imperative of balancing all of the competing rights, this proposal needs to be thought through carefully to ensure the consequences of the measure are as intended and to avoid unintended consequences.  Furthermore, a number of potentially significant legal and constitutional issues arise from consideration in regard to the proposed amendments.  Therefore, there are a number of serious questions about the approach proposed in this Bill, in particular in regard to the issues of competing rights and unintended consequences that could have an adverse impact on the schools of minority denominations.  The Bill must also take into account the potential impact on and distortion of school transport policy and provision.  The issue of catchment areas for schools needs to be examined, with due respect to the importance of the established geographic boundaries and organisation, as well as taking into account the experience of other jurisdictions and the views of stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In light of this, we believe the Bill should be delayed for 12 months.  I disagree with Deputy Joan Burton, who said we were dilly-dallying, and with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who said we were kicking this down the road.  We are delaying it for 12 months to allow time for scrutiny and consideration of the aforementioned matters by the new Joint Committee on Education and Skills, which I believe is a very reasonable approach.  We will also consider the admissions Bill, which is due to be published shortly and which contains a series of measures on which there is broad agreement and which can quickly improve the admissions process for parents and children across the country.  That should proceed on a separate track and not be allowed to be held up by the very complex and difficult issues raised in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, I thank the Labour Party for this proposal.  After consideration by the Oireachtas committee, I believe we will be in a better position to bring forward amendments to the Equal Status Act that can capture the complex legal, constitutional and operational elements in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062800056#DDD00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1467147600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies who contributed.  It was a very good debate on a very serious issue.  I have listened with great care to all the views expressed and know many speakers have given a lot of thought to these issues because they have been around for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  Some colleagues commented that Labour's Equal Status (Admissions to Schools) Bill is not radical enough.  It is, in truth, a modest proposal.  It is clear it is drafted within the constraints of the Constitution, to address the point made by both Ministers who spoke in the debate.  It is designed to address one net issue, namely, to strike a balance between the right of a school to preserve its denominational ethos - it is clear not everybody in the House believes this is right but that is the constitutional position - and the right of a child to attend a State-funded school in his or her own area and, if that be the wish of that child's parents, to avoid religious instruction being given to that child.  I agree that is not an earth-shattering set of proposals but it is very important if it affects any one child.  If a child in a community cannot get into a local school and children from more distant areas are leapfrogging that child simply because they are of the same religious denomination as the patron of the school that is next door, that is not right.  While there are other issues, we can do something about this net issue within the constraints of the Constitution, and we can do it right now.<\/p>  <p>  Our simple belief is that schools that are funded by the State must be prepared to accept pupils from other denominations and from none into their own school community.  Many schools do that anyway, as a matter of course.  Most Deputies agree it is positive for children to study and play with children from other religions and from other ethnic or national backgrounds.<\/p><p>It is good for children and it is a fundamental building block of a better society.  If we know anything from the divisions on our island and, elsewhere, when new migrant communities have come to other European countries, the segregation of communities on the basis of ethnicity, nationality or religion was calamitous in most cases.  Too often we have seen that segregation result in alienation of people from each other and from society.  A lack of social contact with people of different backgrounds is fundamentally bad for society.  As Deputy Burton has set out, what was originally intended to be a mixed religious national school system in this country in the 19th century, which was a progressive view then, has been made into a segregated denominational system of education.  That is the one we grew up in and it is still 96% denominational.  The result has been little or no choice for most parents.  Perhaps there was not an enormous clamour for choice in the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s, but that clamour is there now and we need to address it.  We are not suggesting that the problem can be cured entirely by enacting this legislation.  A solution will require a number of other matters including, as Deputy Burton has very clearly said, the continuation of the vast schools building programme that my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and before her Ruair&iacute; Quinn, set about.  We have to build more schools and more schools of difference so that we provide choice and match the views of parents.  Three quarters of parents want choices that are not available in the current system.  The Bill addresses the issue of local children being effectively locked out of their local schools on religious grounds even where there is a space for them.  They are being leapfrogged by children coming from well outside their local area, simply because they are of a different faith.  That cannot be right.  <\/p> <p> The issue of catchment, which several Deputies have talked about, is important.  In our proposals, we seek to leave that to each school to determine, and I recognise the points made by Deputy Byrne in that regard.  There are huge issues in my constituency of Wexford that need to be addressed by defining catchment, because certain schools are drawing pupils from all over the place and other schools are under-subscribed.   We need to do something about that.  Either we have a CAO system at local level, which was piloted in Limerick, or a defined catchment, but we need to get on with it.  That is a separate issue.<\/p> <p> The Government amendment seeks to stop the Bill from getting a second reading for a year, which there is no coherent or cogent reason for.  Even if somebody said three months, one could make an argument for it, but delaying it for a year can only be interpreted as an attempt to stop the proposal from being enacted.  Surely new politics is about allowing debate and allowing all the issues listed by the Government to be addressed by the committee.  I have served on committees here for 30 years.  There would be no difficulty with any of the points made by Deputy Byrne.  The committees can have hearings, bring in deputations and ask for submissions.  It may take many months, but the idea of voting down the principle of the Bill on Second Stage on Thursday is wrong.  Let the principle be passed so that there is a grounding base document for people to address; otherwise, we are asking the committee to deal with the abstract.  I ask that, in the spirit of new politics and with a genuine sense of engagement by all the people here, because there are many important ideas in this debate, we allow this Bill to pass Second Stage.
