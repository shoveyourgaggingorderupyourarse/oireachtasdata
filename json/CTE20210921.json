We have received no apologies.  As we return to participating at committee meetings in person, I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending and to practise good personal hygiene.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after meetings.  Masks should be worn at all times during meetings except when speaking.  I ask for the full co-operation of members on this.  I apologise for the late start; I was expecting to see everybody in the room.  Some members are in the room and the rest are participating remotely.<\/p> <p>  The first item of business is the minutes of our meetings of 29 June, 1 July, 6 July, 8 July and 13 July.  These have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matter in the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's webpage.<\/p> <p>  A total of 58 sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 5 July and 17 September.  These should be appearing on the screens now.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address the accounts and statements before opening to the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#B00100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632218400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  In the interests of efficiency I will quickly mention the accounts that have been presented.  Obviously after a long break over the summer there has been a significant accumulation of accounts.  If the schedule is put on screen, members will see it starts with departmental and other funds.  The export guarantee account has a clear audit opinion.  The credit union fund account has a clear audit opinion.  The motor tax account, which had a turnover of &euro;938 million, has a clear audit opinion.  The finance accounts, with a turnover of &euro;61.8 billion, also have a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  In the education sector, the accounts of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology received a clear audit opinion.  Limerick Institute of Technology also received a clear audit opinion.  Mary Immaculate College received a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to procurement non-compliance, which is disclosed in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p><p>I also draw attention to the deferred pension funding asset recognition, which is a standard issue for universities and colleges of education.  There is a clear audit opinion for the National College of Art and Design but attention is drawn to the deferred pension funding asset.  There is a clear audit opinion for the Higher Education Authority.  There is a clear audit opinion for Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh, but, again, I drawn attention to procurement non-compliance and deferred pension funding asset.  Again, this is standard for universities.  There is a clear audit opinion for Institute of Technology Sligo and Athlone Institute of Technology.  <\/p><p> The financial statements of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, or Caranua, for 2020 get a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to continued inadequate control over grant payments.  I have drawn attention to this matter for a number of years with regard to Caranua.  The residential institutions redress special account had a turnover of &euro;1 million in 2020 and gets a clear audit opinion.  This is the payment relating to compensation payments made to former residents of residential institutions.  <\/p><p> There are two sets of financial statements regarding Home Building Finance Ireland Lending Designated Activity Company, DAC.  These relate to 2019 and 2020.  The company is a subsidiary of Home Building Finance Ireland and its consolidated financial statements were presented in a timely manner.  However, there was an oversight relating to the presentation of the accounts for 2019 for the subsidiary.  A clear audit opinion was given in both cases.  I will not name all of the NAMA subsidiaries' accounts 17 to 26.  There are ten in total.  These are the subsidiaries of NAMA.  Again, the consolidated accounts were presented earlier.  <\/p><p> There is a clear audit opinion for the HSE for 2020.  I will not repeat the items to which I drew attention last week when I opened for the HSE accounts examination.  There is a clear audit opinion for Tusla, or the Child and Family Agency, but attention is drawn to significant non-compliant procurement and the ICT security breach.  It is the same security breach as occurred with regard to the HSE.  Because Tusla relies on the HSE, it was affected by the security breach.  There is a qualified audit opinion for the National Cancer Registry for 2020.  The accounts for the National Cancer Registry are prepared in accordance with FRS 102, which is the standard accrual accounting standard.  The accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable.  This is something that occurs with a number of health bodies.  I will draw attention to that in each case.<\/p><p> The National Haemophilia Council gets a clear audit opinion.  The Mental Health Commission gets a qualified audit opinion on the same basis I referred to previously.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service gets a clear audit opinion.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority gets a qualified audit opinion - again in respect of the accounting for retirement benefits as they become payable.  The Medical Council gets a clear audit opinion.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund gets a qualified audit opinion on the same basis.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland gets a qualified audit opinion on the same basis.  The Health Insurance Authority gets a qualified audit opinion on the same basis.  I should point out that in respect of the accounts of the Health Insurance Authority, the turnover was &euro;2.7 million.  That relates to its administration costs only.  There is a separate account presented with its annual report that relates to the risk equalisation fund and the turnover on that was &euro;771 million.  A clear audit opinion was given in respect of that.<\/p><p>On State bodies, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority get a clear audit opinion on its 2020 accounts.  The Marine Casualty Investigation Board gets a clear audit opinion.  SOLAS, with a turnover of &euro;837 million, gets a clear audit opinion.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment 2020 accounts get a clear audit opinion.  The Commission for Communications Regulation accounts for 2019-20 get a clear audit opinion.  The National Transport Authority accounts for 2020 get a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to some non-effective expenditure on an ICT project.  Enterprise Ireland gets a clear audit opinion.  The National Oil Reserves Agency, with a 2020 turnover of &euro;121 million, has a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to ineffective expenditure in note 3, relating to &euro;250,000 incurred in respect of an onerous lease contract.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Office of the Planning Regulator gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Economic and Social Research Institute gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which had a turnover of &euro;1.5 billion, gets a clear audit opinion for 2020 but attention is drawn to non-compliance with procurement rules.  The Pensions Authority gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Road Safety Authority gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, with a turnover of &euro;136 million, gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Gathering Project 2013 is a dormant company but I still have to issue an audit opinion on it, and that was clear.  The Residential Tenancies Board gets a clear audit opinion for 2020 but I draw attention to delays and cost increases in the delivery of a new management system for tenancy registrations and disputes that is estimated to cost &euro;5.2 million.  IDA Ireland for 2020 has a turnover of &euro;218 million and it got a clear audit opinion.  Finally, Waterways Ireland, which is a North-South body that I audit jointly with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, had a turnover of &euro;43 million.  This is the 2019 financial statements; there were delays relating to the completion of the financial statements for 2019 but we issued a clear audit opinion in that regard.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  My apologies for that taking so long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632218400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>With regard to number 28, which is Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, the Comptroller and Auditor General notes that attention is drawn to significant non-compliant procurement.

The issue of deferred pension funding comes up repeatedly, and there are other pensions, such as those in the health services, that Mr. McCarthy stated are funded as they go.  Are pensions for universities and colleges funded in advance?  Are they fully funded?  How does that work?  Mr. McCarthy might give us a note on that.  I presume the cost of the liability for pensions in the health bodies is fully captured by the Department of Health.  I presume that cost is included in the health budget as we go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#E00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632218400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Yes.  In the case of universities, the accounts are required to recognise the liabilities that are incurred in the year as a result of staff working.  An actuarial process is gone through to estimate the pension liability that accrues.  There is an assumption in that case, and this a matter I am drawing attention to, that the liabilities will be meet in the future as they arise.  The actual amount of funding provided in a year is tailored to take account of the liabilities as they arise.  The funding is provided on an as-you-need-it basis in relation to pensions.<\/p> <p>  There is a complication with the universities in that they are required by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to maintain what are called pension control accounts.  That is a buffer that forms, in some cases, funding used by the universities as part of their working capital as they go, but in some cases there are deficits.  Most of the universities are operating two or, perhaps, three pension schemes.  It is a very complicated funding arrangement but, as I said, the accounting liabilities are fully recognised there.<\/p> <p>  A different approach is taken with the health bodies.  It does make things much more complicated.  The liabilities that have already accrued in relation to health bodies are not recognised in the Department of Health's financial statements.  The Departments operate on a cash basis so there is no accrual for pensions that have already been incurred.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does a periodic exercise to try to estimate the total of the liabilities.  I think it does that about every three years.  I cannot remember when the last exercise was done.  There may be some reference to that in the finance accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1632218400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>There is a significant issue here in that most of this will be a liability into the future for anyone who is working at the moment.

It might be something that would be worth, at some point, putting a little time into, probably next year.

Given the extent of what happened there, and we certainly do not want to be giving information to people whom one does not want to get that information, understanding that and having a proper understanding of how it can be avoided is something that we should consider examining, perhaps in a year's time or early next year when there is full sight of exactly what the fallout is from it.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is the National Transport Authority, NTA.

I note he says there were inadequate controls over grant payments.  We discussed that with the representatives previously, but the Comptroller and Auditor General might refer back to me.<\/p> <p>  Also, there is Tusla and the significant non-compliant procurement.  That is something we must flag, and likewise with the NTA and the ICT project.

It is in the public interest that in our public institutions such as universities we understand who exactly is sponsoring or undertaking training within particular disciplines.  We are not asking for the names of hundreds and thousands of sponsors or corporate donors to be published; we are asking that where a course is significantly run by a private entity, the public institution should state that clearly, particularly when there are regulatory issues relating to that industry.  I am unhappy with that answer from the university.

Looking at section 3.2 on page 14, a number of sets of legal proceedings are either concluded or under way.  A new set of proceedings was brought against IBRC during 2020.

The latest board was appointed following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  The CEO gave a commitment to contacting the individual who raised this matter with the committee.  As agreed on 13 July, we forwarded this item to the individual but, as set out in R0759, which we will come to, Screen Ireland has not yet made contact.  I propose we request an update from Screen Ireland on its undertaking to contact the individual as well as a breakdown of the percentage of its funding in recent years that has gone to companies associated with board members.

I propose that we take this correspondence with No. 765B, which also addresses the matter.  It is from the Department of Health and dated 25 August 2021.  It is a response to the committee's request for the Department to clarify that the committee \"will be provided with the report on the progress review of the National Paediatric Hospital including the cost of the project, and a timeframe for its completion\".  This follows on from our two meetings with the hospital board in the last term.  The response to our request for sight on the analysis remains the same.  It states that \"Any discussion of costs, however hypothetical or otherwise, at this time, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract, and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the Development Board in its engagement with the main contractor, and the Board&rsquo;s responsibilities for the timely completion of this critical project.\"  While we must take the Department at its word, its position means that we do not have information as to the final cost and completion date for the largest capital project ever undertaken by the State and it appears we will not have that information for an extended period.  I propose that we note and publish this item.  I have flagged it for discussion because we are being strung along.  <\/p><p> Members will recall that, last November, we decided to bring in the board of the new paediatric hospital being developed.  We also asked the Department of Health to come in.  We put that back to the new year because the report on progress and estimates as to the final cost were not available.  We brought the board in on 9 February.  We thought we would get information that day but we did not.  We were told that we would have it soon after.  The months passed by and the information still did not come.  We had the board in again before the summer break but still did not get the information at that time.  We have also visited the hospital.  I do not know what the other members think but I believe we are in a ludicrous position.  The taxpayer is funding the largest capital project in the State.  We are digging deep into pockets and pay packets but we have no idea what the final cost will be and we have no idea about the timelines.  We went out and saw the project.  I do not know about the rest of the committee but, after seeing it, I had more questions than I did before.  It might be an architect's showpiece but I would question how practical or functional some of it is.  <\/p><p> This situation is totally unsatisfactory.  I do not know if other members want to come in on this but the Committee of Public Accounts cannot sit back and take this.  We are being fobbed off by the Department.  How long does it take the Department and the hospital board to come up with a progress report and timelines for the project?  The public need to know what this is going to cost every one of us.

Mr. Peter Boylan has put out the idea that perhaps one of the ways to address the critical needs around the new national maternity hospital is to provide a service at the children's hospital for critical care so that babies requiring such care could be born in that setting and have their needs addressed, as an interim measure if there is a need to look at alternative models for a new national maternity hospital.

There is a difference of approximately 25% between the lowest tenderer and the highest.  It is about how costs have increased dramatically in the past number of months.

Ultimately, from our perspective as a committee, we must know the bottom line of how much the State will pay for this hospital.  This has been rumbling on for years and certainly from that correspondence there does not seem to be any bottom line here.

There were not enough construction workers on that site.  The point I made at a previous meeting was that contracts go both ways.  There is an obligation to pay for the work that is done but, equally, there is an obligation to do the work that is contracted for.  That slippage is potentially very problematic because we can see there is a significant problem with building costs inflation.  That is one of the issues in respect of which I think we need to understand where the controls are.  This will not be the last hospital we will build.  It is to be hoped we will not in the future build hospitals in the same way as the national children's hospital has been built in terms of how the tender process worked.<\/p> <p>  I remember very clearly one occasion on which witnesses were before this committee to discuss this.  When you tender for something and then you make changes, that is where costs are going to arise.  For example, there were changes to the hand basins.  They were going to be changed to stainless steel for infection control purposes.  I would have thought that was self-evident hospital infection control.  You put in your maximum at that stage because it is going to cause you a problem if you do not.<\/p> <p>  We need to be learning lessons as well as everything else from what went wrong with this project in terms of the escalating costs.  If we do not learn those lessons, we are going to repeat exactly the same mistakes again when we go to build another hospital.  Already we are talking about the very controversial location for the national maternity hospital because of the ownership of the site.  First it was &euro;300 million, then it was &euro;500 million, then it was &euro;800 million, so there is a very significant issue here with procurement.  This is a project in respect of which we can better understand where things can go wrong and how things can cause more problems than anticipated.  It is very important we properly scrutinise that so we understand it and we look at the contractual side, because if it is in the interest of a contractor, whether it is this site or any other site, to elongate the timeframe for something at a time when there is building costs inflation, of course the timeline is going to slip and of course it is going to cost more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#R00100","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1632218400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I have just noticed that at the very end of Eamonn Quinn's letter he says, \"The Department is aware that the ...

Therefore, the Department cannot provide any information as to why the building has been left vacant or why it has not been maintained.<\/p> <p>  The Department goes on to set out its role in sport promotion and efforts to secure a permanent ice rink facility in Ireland, including engagement between Sports Ireland and the Irish Ice Hockey Association.  The Department states that Sport Ireland was in the early stages of conducting a feasibility study on the development of a permanent ice rink facility as part of the Sport Ireland National Sports Campus.<\/p><p>No. 738 is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, dated 13 July 2021.  The Secretary General notes that DkIT has responded to the committee, and states that, in terms of governance arrangements, the role of the Minister and the Department is set out in the Technological Higher Education Association code of governance.  However, the Department goes on to state that while it has a sanctioning role under the code of governance regarding material acquisition or disposal of land, including long-term leases, this sanctioning role \"is distinct from the conduct of lease negotiations and operational decisions generally in relation to how DkIT manages and utilises its properties\".  It goes on to say that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in commercial negotiations.<\/p><p> No. 739 is from Professor Michael Mulvey, president of DkIT, setting out a detailed response to its purchase of the then JJB Sports site for &euro;3 million, which includes the Ice Dome.  DkIT received sanction from the HEA for the purchase in 2012.  The correspondence sets out that the purchase was central to its Campus Development Plan 2011-2021.<\/p><p> DkIT states that the Ice Dome was not operational when purchased and that somewhere in the region of &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 million would be required to bring it back into service.  As it wants to maintain control of the property in case it wants to expand its campus, which it states is particularly relevant in the context of its ambition to become a technological university, DkIT intends to continue its efforts to lease the premises.  Essentially, DkIT does not have the financial resources to bring the Ice Dome back into use nor is doing so aligned with its long-term strategic objectives.<\/p><p> DkIT states that it intends to lease the Ice Dome to a tenant with the financial resources to bring it back into service.  In respect of its negotiations over several years with the Irish Ice Hockey Association, DkIT states that &ldquo;the association was afforded every opportunity to present a proposal that met the requirements of the Institute&rdquo; and that it requested a final proposal from the association in February 2021.  DkIT did not deem it to be viable, stating that it presents &ldquo;too high of a commercial and operational risk for the Institute.&rdquo;<\/p><p> No. 740 is from the vice president of the Irish Ice Hockey Association, dated 12 July.  As mentioned, the association has been in negotiations with DkIT to lease the Ice Dome, but ultimately, DkIT did not deem the association&rsquo;s final proposal viable with the end result that we have a decaying ice rink with an owner not interested in using the facility for its intended purpose; an ice hockey association with no ice rink which is unusual to say the least; and no permanent ice-rink facility in the State.<\/p><p> The association has submitted extensive and detailed correspondence on the matter over a number of years, including Sport Ireland&rsquo;s 2018 support in principle for the association&rsquo;s bid to reopen the Ice Dome, subject to the costs being met by the association.  The association has also provided the minutes of DkIT&rsquo;s governing body&rsquo;s meetings, which are publicly available.  They detail DkIT&rsquo;s consideration of the matter, from its intention in 2017 to sell the Ice Dome to the current decision to lease it.  <\/p><p> The association&rsquo;s 2018 business plan notes that the United Kingdom has 63 ice facilities and that New Zealand, a country of similar demographic and history of ice sports to Ireland, has four indoor arenas.  I thank members for their patience on listening to me outline the gist of the current situation.  I will now open the floor to members.

No. 741B, dated 12 July 2021, is from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs, RT&Eacute;, and provides information requested by the committee on a range of issues.  No. 754B, dated 30 July 2021, is also from RT&Eacute;.  I propose we take the two together.<\/p> <p>  Part of the information requested by the committee on a number of occasions was the amount paid by RT&Eacute; to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of a Revenue audit inquiry into the engagement of contractors by RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; states that, as the process has now concluded, it can disclose the amount paid to Revenue was &euro;1.223 million.  Members will recall that, at a meeting earlier in the year, we extracted the fact it made a settlement.  We had also requested information on the parallel audit being conducted by the Department of Social Protection.  RT&Eacute; states it is ongoing but no interim payment has been made to the Department.  As with the Revenue process, RT&Eacute; states it is unable to provide more detail until the audit has concluded.  That is obviously relating to the employer's liabilities in respect of each employee.<\/p> <p>  On the committee's request that RT&Eacute; conduct a comparative review of the remuneration of Irish-speaking workers at Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and their counterparts in RT&Eacute;, first made at our meeting with RT&Eacute; last April, RT&Eacute; states it has appointed a company with specific experience in the media sector to carry out a full evaluation of all staff roles and grades in RT&Eacute;.  Irish language roles will be part of this review, which was set to commence this month.  This review follows on from the recommendations contained within the role and gender review report conducted by Mr. Kieran Mulvey on behalf of RT&Eacute; in 2017.  One of the key recommendations in Mr. Mulvey's report was to review and simplify its current structure, which has 167 different grades.  RT&Eacute; states it is following through on this recommendation and, while it cannot undertake to conduct also a review specific to any one service, it will be addressed as part of the wider review.<\/p> <p>  I propose we note and publish this correspondence and ask RT&Eacute; to provide us with the findings of the social protection audit as well as the findings of the organisational review as soon as they become available.

Agreed.<\/p><p> There was correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood that officially outlined for the first time that RT&Eacute; made a settlement with Revenue regarding people who were wrongly classified as self-employed, or what is referred to as bogus self-employment.  That has been an important step forward for the Committee of Public Accounts but we need to know much more about the payments.  What were they for?  How many staff members does that payment take account of?  What about other staff?  Does the payment cover only what the State was owed or does it cover compensation to those 11 workers?  We need to know more about the audit that is being carried out by the Department of Social Protection and the number of workers involved in that.  We need to know more about what RT&Eacute; is doing about these contracts and workplace practices around the classification of employment and what is sometimes referred to as bogus self-employment.  We have got the figure of the settlement between RT&Eacute; and Revenue.  As soon as the figures relevant to the Department of Social Protection and the PRSI contributions that are due in that regard are available, we should look for that information.  I request that we correspond with RT&Eacute; and thank it for the information that has been provided.  We should also highlight there are other specific pieces of information we want.

That is not RT&Eacute;'s fault because defamation laws require urgently to be changed.  Every media outlet has a particular issue with the current defamation laws.  Perhaps if we got that figure back, we could follow through to the Department to seek a change.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the Revenue audit, Eversheds did a two-year look-back in the report it conducted.  I am sure Revenue will not be limited by that because I think some of the staff who had a change in their employment status, those who became employees as opposed to contractors, would have flagged up this issue for some considerable time.  A Revenue audit will be dictated by Revenue.  It will decide the parameters as opposed to the entity being audited.  I suspect Revenue will go back further than Eversheds did.  Revenue will dictate that.  The important thing is that if Revenue does not provide that report, if the amount of &euro;1.2 million changes, we will see that in the RT&Eacute; accounts.

The RTE report indicates that there will be no payments to the Department of Social Protection, that the Revenue Commissioners have responsibility for the collection of taxes and that the payments that were made by RTE include PRSI.

We also wrote to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this regard, and that response will come before the committee at the next meeting, at which we will consider the correspondence.  The issue arose from our engagement with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of planning permission for data centres which are huge users of electricity and water.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications referenced the Government statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's enterprise strategy, which was published in 2018 and states that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, Ireland's independent energy and water regulator, has responsibility for policies regarding the national grid.  The commission works with EirGrid and the ESB networks to issue connection offers to the grid.<\/p><p>The Minister stated that planning permission and grid connections are separate requirements, and while planning permission must be in place before grid connection is sought, planning permission does not guarantee grid connection.  <\/p><p> A consultation on the future development and operation of the electricity system was launched last March, and focuses on the need to cater for the transition to 70% renewable energy by 2030 as well as increased demand.  The total electricity requirement for large energy users, including data centres, is set to more than double by 2030.  The Minister stated that a number of actions have been taken to ensure continuity of supply, given data centres' implications for the national grid over the coming years.  In a paper published in June, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities acknowledged that some form of intervention is necessary and a consultation process has now closed.

Being increasingly confident that we have electricity is not a standard of public service that the public expects from Government or from a Government Minister.  Given that this matter has come into focus since the committee last met, I suggest, with the Chairman's permission, that we write the Minister to seek information on any potential rolling blackouts or his Department's views the cause of such blackouts.  This should be done in light of the fact that a significant amount from the public purse has been spent in recent years on upgrading green energy and indeed on the grid itself, and also given what we know about the drain on electricity and water supplies that these data centres represent.  We know that these centres are popping up and there are probably more planning applications in for data centres in this State than across Europe.  The drain on our electricity and water supplies must be weighed against an average of 50 jobs per centre.  Given the relationship with our water supply, it is nowhere near fit for purpose or up to standard as it is.  Yet, there seems to be no taking into account of the drain that these data centres represent.

The Minister has come out in recent days, and, as I understand it, has said that there is nothing to worry about and there will not be blackouts.  However, we know that on those frosty, dark nights, the wind does not blow, so there are no wind turbines moving.  We also know that there is no sun on those nights, so the solar panels will not work.  Therefore, we are heavily dependent on the gas-generating stations and we know there are difficulties with that.  We also know that there are plans to import some temporary generators.  As the Committee of Public Accounts, we have a right to ask about continuity of supply, because if the lights go out, the whole thing is banjaxed.<\/p><p>We have the right to know about the potential costs of any temporary generators or other interim solutions that are brought in.  To follow on from the issues raised by the previous speakers, this is the area on which to focus.  I am concerned that we have closed down the peat-burning power stations in the midlands, because we are moving away from peat.  I understand the logic in that.  However, this morning, a shipload of peat arrived from Lithuania.  My understanding is that it travelled almost 3,000 km.  I would like somebody explain to me the logic of all of that.  I do not get the logic of it from an economic point of view or from the point of view of reducing carbon emissions.<\/p><p> There is a real issue around electricity generation and the response from the Minister on the data centres.  On the one hand, we are dishing out planning permission for data centres as a State while on the other hand, we are importing generators to use as stopgap measures to keep supply to the grid.  As a result of this, we, as the Committee of Public Accounts, need to ask questions about the security of supply, the cost of the generators, and their projected costs going into the future.<\/p><p> I propose that we note and publish the correspondence we have on the outcome of the consultation process.  That has been agreed.  I also request that we seek further information from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Gas has become precarious.  There are some, including the Minister, who raised concerns in the past about using gas as a transition fuel.  I raised that concern with him at the climate action committee three years ago.  Back then, he told me that importing electricity generated by nuclear power was preferable to using gas.  However, this is where we are at that moment.  The immediate concerns are: the security of supply; the implications all of this has on the public purse; and the implications of the costs of interim solutions, such as the use of generators a stop-gap solution.

I thank the committee for its time this afternoon.  Peatlands have been one of the most abiding features of the Irish landscape since the last ice age.  They cover a large area of the land surface, occurring as raised bogs, blanket bogs and fens.  Peatlands have a key biodiversity value and provide a range of ecosystem services.  They are considered among the most important ecosystems of the world because of their huge carbon stores and their ability, when growing, to capture carbon and thus help to regulate climate.  Irish peatlands are a significant carbon store, containing up to 75% of all the national soil organic carbon.  On average, peatlands are estimated to contain between 30 kg and 70 kg of soil carbon per cubic metre.  This is about ten times as much as a typical mineral soil.<\/p> <p>  Over the centuries, peatlands have been naturally cooling the atmosphere, the opposite to human-induced warming caused by the emission of carbon dioxide, by removing CO2 from the atmosphere.  When peatlands are drained or damaged, the peat oxidises and the carbon is released back to the atmosphere.  Peat oxidation can be stopped or reduced through the restoration of sites and hydrological management measures.  A restored bog can actively sequester carbon, and once restored it becomes a carbon store.  It is essential to keep the carbon stored in the ground and restore and rehabilitate the hydrological balance.  This means water must be maintained close to the peatland surface over most of the year to return degraded peatlands to sinks or carbon neutral systems.<\/p> <p>  Action 5 of the national peatlands strategy provides for a review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  To undertake this review, the former Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht established a working group comprising representatives from that Department, which chaired the working group, from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and from the Environmental Protection Agency.<\/p> <p>  The working group produced an issues paper on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  This paper was published on 9 October 2019 and submissions were invited on the paper by 31 January 2020.  Thirty-four submissions were received from industry stakeholders, environmental non-governmental organisations and the public and all of these are available to view online.  A report on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry was prepared by the inter-agency working group on the basis of the submissions received.  I published this report in September 2020.<\/p> <p>  The review report concludes there are significant positives and negatives arising from ending the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  There are complexities in terms of the environmental benefits of ending horticultural peat extraction set against the economic consequences for the industry, food security, the lack of an effective alternative to peat and the economic and cultural impact on the local communities that would be affected.<\/p> <p>  Based on the recommendations in the report, I set up a working group comprised of representatives of the relevant Departments, State bodies, environmental non-governmental organisations and various sectors within the horticultural industry.  This group, under an independent chairman, Dr. Munoo Prasad, has had 11 meetings to date.  As well as discussing the current situation the horticultural industry finds itself in, the working group has focused on the potential of alternatives to the use of peat in the horticultural industry.  It has had a number of presentations from, for example, the chair of the UK Growing Media Association, an associate professor at the school of agriculture and food science in UCD, Teagasc, and from growing media producers and horticultural industry growers.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, large-scale peat extraction is subject to a dual consent regime of both planning permission and integrated pollution control licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated regulations, requires planning permission.  Under the planning and development regulations of 2001, peat extraction in a new or extended area of less than 10 ha or in a new or extended area of 10 ha or more where the drainage of the bogland commenced prior to 21 January 2002 is exempted development.  This exemption is subject to a restriction in section 4(4) of the 2000 Act whereby that exempted development status is lost if an environmental impact assessment under the EU environmental impact assessment directive or appropriate assessment under the habitats directive is required in respect of that development.<\/p> <p>  Peat extraction involving a new or extended area of 30 ha or more requires an environmental impact assessment and, therefore, planning permission.  Peat extraction below that threshold may require an environmental impact assessment if it is considered it would be likely to have significant effects on the environment.  Any peat extraction that would be likely to have significant effects on a European site, such as a special area of conservation or a special protection area, requires an appropriate assessment and, therefore, planning permission.<\/p> <p>  The environmental impact assessment directive is a European Union law which requires that consent for development for certain public and private projects likely to have significant environmental effects should be granted only after an assessment of those effects has been carried out by a competent authority.  The first iteration of the directive was adopted in 1985.  The directive is broadly transposed into Irish legislation through several development and activity consent systems covering, for example, land use planning, waste permitting, integrated pollution control licensing, roads and motorway construction, and foreshore development.<\/p> <p>  Peat extraction of an area greater than 50 ha requires planning consent from a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well as integrated pollution control licensing from the EPA, with reference to the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, as amended, both of which regimes require environmental impact assessments to be carried out by the respective competent authorities, which are the planning authority and the EPA, and appropriate assessment if relevant.<\/p> <p>  The planning system includes the availability of the substitute consent process set out in Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000, under which regularisation of any development requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment under the planning side of the dual consent regime may be sought.<\/p><p>If a proposal for peat harvesting requires retrospective regularisation of historic peat extraction that should have been subject to environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment but was not, then the proposed activity would require both substitute consent approval as well as a prospective planning permission under the planning regime, in addition to relevant consents under the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s integrated pollution control licensing regime.  Irrespective of whether an alternative consent regime could be put in place, there can be no derogation from the need to comply with the environmental impact assessment and habitats directives.<\/p><p> The horticultural industry makes a significant contribution to economic output and employment in Ireland.  The productive potential of the sector has relied on peat-based growing media and peat casing.  The sector is divided into subsectors, each having unique requirements in terms of peat harvesting.  Harvesting of peat by growing media and mushroom casing manufacturers in recent years has been challenging from a legal and regulatory point of view in the context of planning permission and integrated pollution control licensing requirements.  Consequently, the working group first examined this issue.  Arising from deliberations within the group, the chairman submitted an interim report to me last May.  The interim report sets out the biodiversity value of peatlands, which also provide a range of ecosystem services, information on peatlands used for the production of peat for horticulture in Ireland and on the horticultural industry in Ireland, the reliance on peat in the Irish horticultural industry, the challenges in securing alternative growing media to peat, the proposed alternatives to peat, information on the importation of peat, the current legislative provisions for large-scale peat extraction and a series of proposals relating to the current position the horticultural industry finds itself in.<\/p><p> The interim report also indicates there is general agreement among the members of the working group that peat for the professional horticulture sector should be available until a target date of 2030 and a maximum target date of 2035, with the amount of peat being used by the sector being phased out over that time.  There should be strict monitoring of the reduction by an independent body.  The level of reduction would depend on the success of research and development on peat alternatives.<\/p><p> It is clear a solution to this issue requires a multi-departmental and multi-agency response in co-operation with the industry and academia.  In that regard, and following on from the receipt of the interim report, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are working on a suite of measures as regards the situation in the horticultural industry.  I understand that Dr. Prasad, the chairman of the working group, is preparing his final report, which will focus on the potential of alternatives to the use of peat in the horticultural industry.  This report will be presented to the working group before being sent to me.  Currently, we hope the final report will be submitted to me by the end of September.<\/p><p> I worked in the horticultural sector in the past.  It is a very important sector to Ireland.  We are working collaboratively and, working together, we can find a solution to the significant challenge currently faced by the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#A00500","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>There is huge frustration out there and people are worried about the economic viability of the sector.

I am aware our peatlands are an important ecosystem.  I was lucky enough to grow up in the bog and I am lucky enough to still live on the edge of the bog.  I value and appreciate what the bog did for us as a young family when we were growing up.  I am appreciative of the people who worked on the bogs of Ireland over the years.<\/p><p>We were warned time and again that we would end up importing peat.  We were warned time and again that just transition was going to fail the midlands.  My phone was pinging from early this morning.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>is not widely circulated in Longford but the story quickly made the rounds.  Former Bord na M&oacute;na employees and peat producers were aghast to learn of the massive importation of peat into County Louth at the weekend.  Some 3,600 tonnes of peat travelled 3,000 km from Latvia.  Similar if not better quality peat could have been extracted from bogland no more than ten to 15 miles away and could have been brought on 10 km journeys.  We are now being told by Growing Media Ireland, which represents the peat producers, that we are going to need at least two shipments the size of what arrived into the country last Saturday to meet Ireland's peat demands for the foreseeable future.  As I say, there is great anger out there, not only with the Department Housing, Local Government and Heritage but also with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan.  We have had 11 meetings of the working group at this stage and yet we have seen no actions emanating from the interim report that was submitted in May.<\/p><p>Peat producers are aghast, disillusioned and disappointed.  They looked for a fair, equitable and workable licensing system that would have enabled them to extract peat.  Everybody within the sector accepts there is a short lifespan left for the sector.  As the Minister of State rightly said, that lifespan may end in 2030 or may extend to 2035.  I appreciate the Minister of State is only here for a short while but we need to see some message of hope and positivity, and some degree of certainty, going out to these peat producers because the midlands, the heart of Ireland in terms of bogland and energy production over the past 60 years, has lost faith in the just transition process.  Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB have ridden roughshod over the region at this stage.  It must be said we are rapidly losing faith in the Minister of State's Department and, as I said earlier, in the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan.<\/p><p>I have three questions to ask before I hand over to my colleagues.  What hope can the Minister of State give us today that I can relay to the peat producers, many of whom are logged in and watching his contribution?  What reassurance can I give those producers, their families and employees that their sector is not going to be written off, that it is going to get a lifeline that will enable them to continue producing to 2030 or 2035?  Will the Minister of State tell us definitively whether there will be a route forward for the sector?<\/p><p>Bord na M&oacute;na withdrew its seven applications from An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the start of the year, leaving two live applications, both of which are from a local producer, Klasmann Deilmann, which is just up the road from me in Rathowen.  There is surely an opportunity there for some of the Department officials to liaise with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to prioritise and, it is hoped, get those two applications over the line to allow the producer to start extracting that peat to try to head off the absolute folly whereby we imported more than 200 truckloads into our country last Saturday, something we are going to repeat twice every month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#B00300","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.  I, too, want to reference today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  There were two articles relating to these matters.  My phone was hopping at 9 o'clock in response to those articles.  The timescale to find a practical and ecological alternative to peat must be reasonable and realistic.  I am not sure the times the Minister of State has set out to 2030 or 2035 are realistic, sustainable or appropriate given the difficulties faced by the mushroom industry and horticultural propagation sector, with which I know the Minister of State is familiar.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the target date of 2030 with a maximum target date of 2035.  That means ten to 14 years to phase out the use of peat in the Irish horticultural industry.  We are, in effect, going to importing peat for the next 14 years, according to the logic the Minister of State has set out, while research is done on replacing peat with an alternative.  Of the 3,600 tonnes of peat imported from Latvia last week, what purification, if any, was carried out on this important product?  That is an important question.  What controls are being put in place for the by-product of this imported peat?  That is particularly relevant if we have not addressed the issue of purification.  The cost of importing peat could be up to three times that of sourcing it domestically.  Consumers will have to absorb that cost in their pockets and that is a concern.<\/p><p> What about the countries that are exporting their peat and their carbon stores?  We live in the European Union.  We have heard time and again in recent debates on climate action and the challenges around all that about solidarity with our neighbours in the European Union and how we are all in this together.  We have to address that.  It is not good enough to say we have a different requirement.  We have our neighbours in the European Union.  The Minister of State has his fellow activists and party members across many of the states of the European Union.  We need to address those issues.<\/p><p> I would like to hear the Minister of State's response.  I do not doubt his commitment to biodiversity and peatlands conservation and restoration - I share those ambitions and concerns with him - but we have to be realistic about timelines for the phasing out of peat and we have to have a successful, viable and commercial alternative, and we simply have no idea when that will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#B00400","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  I do not want to repeat some of what the other speakers have stated but I fully concur with their thoughts on this issue.  I know we are all very interested in the green agenda, but I can tell the Minister of State that it is getting a huge amount of negativity since we are not able to sort out what I believe is a small issue but a major issue to an awful lot of people out there in the indigenous horticulture and nursery sectors.  A short-term measure is needed to look after the horticulture and nursery sectors because of the sudden end of harvesting here.  What is needed is for us to have a practical approach to this and to be able to harvest a small amount of peat that is needed for a huge industry but a very minor industry in the scheme of things.  It is a very important industry to all of us.<\/p> <p>  As an island nation, Ireland is exposed to a huge number of risks, including disease, by importing peat.  We have seen that with ash dieback.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State and his Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have taken this into consideration.  I understand there is a suggestion that there is a need for a change to legislation for a very common-sense solution here.  I do not want to finger-point - I understand the Green Party is in government and that my party is in government with the Green Party - but I would suggest there is an unwillingness on the part of the Minister of State as a member of the Green Party and on the Green Party as members of the Government to have this practical change to legislation.  We see the green agenda coming down the tracks and fast approaching us.  If we were to do something small for this sector, I assure the Minister of State that the Government would get a huge amount of goodwill from other sectors.  A common-sense approach is needed.<\/p> <p>  We hear that 4,000 tonnes arrived into Ireland on Saturday morning, involving 200 trucks travelling 3,000 km.  What does that do for carbon emissions?  If we try to sell peat, it is almost like selling sand to the Arabs.  We can sell peat to everybody, but importing it does not make sense on this occasion.  I have great respect for and support the green agenda, but we have a very small agenda here that we have to look after as well.  I know the Minister of State will probably ask what else will come down the tracks if we look after this small industry.  I think most people understand carbon credits and the green agenda that faces us.<\/p> <p>  I was contacted by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, about Kelly's Nursery, in Streamstown, near Mullingar.  Some other Deputies from the midlands might be very well aware of Kelly's.  It had a recent inspection, there was a positive result for a disease and plants within an exclusion zone of 2 m around all the plants that were found to be positive had to be destroyed.  If a disease comes in with the imported peat, what sort of financial package will be available for that?  We have seen this with ash dieback and in other areas.  I feel there is a common-sense approach to be taken, and Deputy Noonan is a common-sense Minister of State.  I have known him for many years.  He and his officials, along with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, have to see a common-sense approach here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#C00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I will take those three members' questions together if that is okay, Chairman.  I will make an initial comment to address Deputy Flaherty, Senator Boyhan and Deputy Kehoe about this being the green agenda.  It is not the green agenda; it is the law.  That is the reality of this.  My Department, which has responsibility for heritage, has no role in this except in the sense that the peatlands strategy, specifically recommendation No. 5 of the strategy, was to establish this working group to look at alternatives.  We took up that challenge in September 2020 and acted very swiftly to do that not long after forming the Government.  We tasked Dr. Prasad and the working group to look at alternatives.  I assure the committee members they are working flat out to try to achieve that and to look at those alternatives.<\/p><p>Excuse me if I am skipping some of the questions.  Senator Boyhan raised the issue of my stating that the timeframe for finding a solution is 2030 to 2035.  That is the recommendation of the interim report, not my recommendation.  I said at the outset of this that my preferred option was not to import peat.  I saw the report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today and it is disheartening.  Peat has been imported but, historically, there have also been significant quantities of peat exported from this country.  The reality is that it is a commodity.  I am taking on board the issue of a biohazard and the challenges surrounding importation of peat.<\/p><p>I will go through the other questions quickly because I want to try to allow in all the members.  In response to Deputy Flaherty's comments on hope, I am saying the whole of the Government is putting all its effort into this.  I spoke to the Taoiseach about this last week and he is very concerned and wants to seek a resolution, but we have to act within the law.  Even moving towards a single consent regime will not get us there any faster because it will require primary legislation.  As for a route forward, we are trying to seek a short-term and medium-term solution.  In my view, a longer term solution around alternatives has to be brought about more quickly than 2030 because of the significant challenges surrounding climate and biodiversity but also to provide assurance to the sector.  I hope I have addressed that.<\/p><p>As for the imported peat, I have addressed the point Senator Boyhan raised.  As I said, there is a significant carbon impact of importation of peat and the vehicles required to transport it.  There is no doubt about that.  As I said, however, peat is imported and exported, and one of the solutions that had been put forward is importation.  It would have been much easier to seek a solution in Ireland and to be able to use Irish peat but, as I said, we are locked within the existing law.  If Mr. Brian Lucas is with us, and I thank him because I know he has been before the committee on a number of occasions and has been a great asset in trying to steer us through the legal challenges, he might address specifically the issue of the current dual consent and moving towards a possible single consent regime.  The committee has probably heard about that already.  The challenges in that regard are significant as well.  I will hand over to Mr. Lucas on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#C00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>This came up the last day I was before the committee with officials from two other Departments.

There would also be a need to introduce new systems and processes by whatever statutory body was given responsibility for such a new system.<\/p><p>Only at that point could the regulation process begin under a new consent system which we have talked about before, namely, leave to apply followed by substitute consent, an application for planning permission and, if necessary, an integrated pollution control licence from the EPA.

I ask what we mean by \"a small amount of peat\".  The previous day I was before the committee, I referred to the regime for the exempt development provisions for sites under 30 ha, which the Minister of State also talked about in his opening statement.

I am fully aware that at the time no Department would take it up and they and their Department were essentially lumped with it.  There is a serious concern here for a simple reason.  We had a person in from the Department with responsibility for climate and they were the most arrogant person ever to come before a committee.  They basically said straight out that part of the solution is going to be importing peat.  Anyone with any environmental brain in their head will know bringing peat 200 km to a boat, 3,000 km on the boat and then having 200 lorry loads of it going up and down the country is complete lunacy.  I know everyone wants to get in questions fairly quickly.  We need clarity on this.  We are dancing from report to report.  It is not the Minister of State's fault.  Earlier Deputy Kehoe mentioned the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  He is in the Department with responsibility for the environment.  He has the authority to bring planning forward if need be and it would be helpful if that was done.  Substitute consent in the quarries has been a disaster.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, whether there is a commitment one way or the other in Government on harvesting next April.  Nobody is going to harvest it now for the winter; there is no point.  The Government now has a window of seven months to get this solved.  As Deputy Flaherty asked earlier, will the Government give a commitment to the people who need to harvest this by next April?  I understand from the working group that everyone is in agreement we must do it until 2030 or maybe 2035, as the Minister of State has outlined.  Is there a commitment from Government that for the harvest season starting April next year, people will be able to go out to save this industry?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lucas will be familiar with my second question.  I have worked with him for years and, as the man says, I cannot commend him well enough, in fairness to him.  We did a system for certain bogs where we picked areas out - Mr. Lucas will be able to give me an answer on this - and you looked at the up-welling and did all the scientific work.  Mr. Ray Flynn, who all the witnesses probably know, was involved in it.  You basically showed there was an area of the bog that would not be worth restoring, to put it simply.  Is there a process like that which could be brought in?  To Mr. Lucas specifically, what if these people picked out, say, a 50 ha plot and said they were going to do that 50 ha this year, keep men in there and then go to another place and revamp that?  Are there not solutions like that which can be done to ensure we keep the consistency of supply to resolve this problem?<\/p> <p>  My third question is for the Minister of State.  It is not associated with this and he may not know about it.  I raise the issue of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, where natural heritage areas, NHAs, were to be in category 2.  Many farmers who want to plant trees are held up at the moment because of a Bill that fell in the previous D&aacute;il that was to come in before Christmas of this year, I think.  Is getting that resolved on the agenda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#D00400","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>There are thousands of jobs at risk.  In his opening remarks the Minister of State indicated he recognised the importance of these jobs to the rural economy and rural communities.  He also said he was disappointed at the importation witnessed today.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister of State accept that, at present, there is no alternative to the extraction of peat for many sectors of the horticultural industry?  I refer, as I have done on multiple occasions, to the mushroom industry which is of particular importance in my constituency.  Stockpiles are close to exhausted.  There is sub-30 ha harvesting under what can only be described as confused structures that even those harvesting do not believe can meet demand.  Alternatives do not exist.  Even where there are limited options like coir from India and Sri Lanka, they themselves create environmental concerns.  Take it as a given we want to protect our bogs, the biodiversity they have and we want to see an alternative to peat use.  On the other hand we also want to see viable rural communities and economies based on them.<\/p> <p>  We should bear in mind this is the seventh ship entering the island of Ireland because there have been others to Belfast and that product has made its way down.  We now have a situation where huge shiploads are being imported into Ireland.  Each of these shiploads involve 200 trucks transporting peat from where it is harvested in the Baltic to a port there, then a 3,000 km sea journey to Ireland where a further 200 trucks meet the ship to unload the peat and deliver it to Irish plants to be processed.  We can compare that to journeys in Ireland for peat production, which were as short as 10 km on average.  Does the Minister of State accept this is an absolute failure on his part and on the part of his Department and the Government?<\/p> <p>  The first three people who uttered, in my presence, that importation was to be the alternative were the Minister of State himself, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  This was not just an accident we should all be surprised about.  This was the strategy.  We would eliminate the extraction of peat in Ireland to create the facade we were doing something on environmental protection but we would, on the most hypocritical basis, then allow these shipments to arrive.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Minister of State on one point.  It is nothing short of a scandal that a State-owned company, Bord na M&oacute;na, was for over two decades exporting hundreds and thousands of tonnes of peat, knowing as it did that this crisis was likely to emerge.  Nobody said \"Stop\" when that was happening and now we have a situation where for the next decade or so we will see the importation of what is primarily water.  The shipments coming in are 80% water because the peat must be wet for sectors like mushroom production.<\/p><p> My two questions are as follows.  How is it that Latvia, Lithuania, Germany and other countries are able to put in place legislative frameworks allowing for the extraction of peat in those countries while remaining in line with EU law while we are not?  The Minister of State as mentioned the second issue.  The only viable alternative to the importation of peat is for Government to introduce a single-stage application process that would allow the harvesting of horticultural peat to meet the domestic needs of the sector in a sustainable way.  This would allow us to manage, monitor and enforce the environmental regulations.  The Minister of State has acknowledged the need for legislation, which would need to be primary legislation.  What steps have been taken within his Department to prepare that legislation?  Considering the number of emergency laws that have been passed over the last 18 months, surely it is not beyond our capabilities to prepare such legislation quickly, speedily and efficiently so that we can protect core jobs for rural economies that have very few others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#D00500","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.

A message should go out from this committee today that this is absolutely unrelated to the Green Party's agenda or the general green or environmental agenda.

My Department has limited responsibility with regard to heritage and no responsibility with regard to the planning side of things or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.<\/p> <p>  We will absolutely use those six months wisely.  We have used the time to date wisely.  We have given every single consideration to how we could deal with this in an Irish context.  In saying this, I address Deputy Carthy as well.  It was never my preference for importation to be an option.  It is certainly a less favourable option environmentally when quality peat exists in this country but the law is the law.

With regard to the work we did on the raised bogs, we used the existing legislation that is already in place under the Planning and Development Act.

The submissions we received from guests on each occasion, irrespective of what Department or area they are from, are a rehash of working group and interim reports.

To see a shipment of just under 4,000 tonnes of peat come into the country at the weekend was crazy.  As Deputy Carthy said, it is not just about 200 trucks in Ireland because another 200 trucks had to load that product over in Latvia and it also travelled 3,000 miles by sea.<\/p> <p>  All sectors of Irish horticulture will be affected, including the mushroom industry and small fruit and vegetable growers in north Dublin and throughout rural Ireland.  They will be severely affected.  It is not only the growers themselves who will be impacted by the increased cost from importing this into the country, as was said.  This will work its way down to consumers having to pay extra.  We all saw the news about increases in electricity prices and so on.  It is the consumer again who will get hit hard by this.  We have been talking to John Neenan from Growing Media Ireland.  That organisation is saying the cost of importing horticultural peat from Latvia and so on could be up to three times the cost of sourcing the same product in Ireland.  The importation of peat has considerable consequences for the environment, with considerable emissions of carbon to transport that 3,000 miles by sea.<\/p> <p>  Senator Daly mentioned as well, and we need to recognise, that 17,000 jobs are at risk from these kinds of decisions.  Some 17,000 families can be affected by this.  We have also spoken to Frank Alley, who the Cathaoirleach knows, in my parish of Dundrum.  He has told us they have been wasting their time and it is totally unfair on growers like him and others throughout the country.  This is the kind of suspicion they have of that working group the Minister of State keeps talking about.<\/p> <p>  Before he goes, I thank the Minister of State and his officials for coming.  It is ludicrous to think that we are in a situation where peat is being imported from Latvia into this country.  If one of us said 30 years ago we would start importing peat into the country, we would be locked up.  It is the Minister of State's Department that is saying this represents progress in reducing emissions.  It is unbelievable.

They ensured Bord na M&oacute;na was closed down six years before it was destined to close down.  There was moss peat left behind in Bord na M&oacute;na in the middle of the country.  The Government is saying there are alternatives for nurseries in Kerry and for the horticulture sector.  We are not even being told what the alternatives are.  Will we lose those jobs?  It is the same as the briquettes.  It is no bother to import moss peat and briquettes into the country and, at the same time, our bogs are lying idle.

Before the next peat harvesting season starts, we need to be able to harvest peat here for our horticulture and nursery industries.  That is environmentally and economically sensible.  There is a danger in that the cost base of these industries is being threatened and they could relocate, especially the mushroom industry, which is a very tight margin industry.  We have huge concerns about not being able to keep its cost base in check.  Importation of peat obviously puts huge financial pressure on those companies.

Many of the members might already know me as an agricultural journalist, but I also have the privilege to farm with my grandmother in County Limerick.  Like many members of the committee, I had a farm childhood that was both blessed with warm summer days helping to bring in hay bales and cursed with the dubious honour of standing in gaps in the biting cold of winter.  Farming is in my blood, as it is for many of the colleagues here with me.  Growing up, all I wanted to be was a farmer, like my grandmother.  Yet, the reality of the day is that I am one of fewer than 500 young women throughout Ireland of my generation who are under 35 years of age, who grew up to be farmers and who are in receipt of farm payments.  An even more frightening statistic is that there are more women over the age of 80 who the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine considers to be actively farming than there are women under the age of 40 who are considered to be actively farming.  That same figure is not shared by our male counterparts in farming.  This highlights the impact of a long-held tradition where farms are passed from generation to generation by way of the eldest son.<\/p> <p>  The family farm is sacred to rural Ireland.  However, just as no man is an island, the reality is that hardly any farm operates without the input of both partners.  For example, when my great-grandfather had to emigrate to England to work on the railroads to support his family, it was my great-grandmother who milked the cows every morning and evening and got their nine children off to school.  Women have always shared the workload on Irish farms, yet the official recognition of that work has never happened.  Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures show that 70,000 women are getting up every single day to help out on farms in some capacity, yet roughly just 16,000 women are in receipt of payments.  Just 3.8% of all farms in Ireland are held in joint male-female names.  The figures are not improving organically, and the primary aim of the Women in Agriculture Stakeholders Group, WASG, is to push the number of women farming in their own name and in partnerships to 25% by 2030 through the mechanics of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.<\/p> <p>  The group is made up of representatives from the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICSA, Macra na Feirme, the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, the Irish Organic Association, IOA, West Women in Farming, and South East Women in Farming.  It is completely voluntary.  Since coming together just over a month ago, we have made our first CAP submission and have met with senior officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss it.  We also have a social media presence and a mailing list, and we have the support of women of all ages.<\/p> <p>  I know the submission has been circulated to  committee members already, so I will not bore them overly with the points.  In it, we have the target to reach 25% of female farmers by 2030, through partnerships and single owners.  We are saying there should be a 60% targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS, grant for women over 40, because the figures we received show that less than 4% of TAMS money went to women.  There should be a female-only knowledge transfer, KT scheme and a top-up scheme for KT groups that have at least three female members.  We would also like a partnership tax credit to work in line with a succession tax credit similar to that, whereby a woman could enter into a formal partnership with a male farmer - it could be a daughter, daughter-in-law, or wife - over a five-year period and the farmer would receive &euro;5,000 a year tax credit, but the farm would have to be divided 50:50 between the farmer and the woman coming onto the farm.  Another point we would like to touch on is that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must commit to plan and fund a national women in agriculture dialogue as set out in Food Vision 2030.<\/p> <p>  We welcome any questions committee members might have on our submission.

It is great to see them.  I have daughters myself, and when I need a hand, sometimes they are out quicker than the lads.  Ms Quinn-Mulligan talked about the CAP going forward.  Regarding the mentality, I presume, and I would have looked into a bit of this, that the reason the numbers are greater for those later in life is, say, the spouse would be dead or something and they were handing the farm over to the other person.  I think that was the reason I got before on that.<\/p> <p>  What are the actions regarding CAP and otherwise?  This is about a sea change in the whole farming community, to be quite frank about it.  It is about respect for people who are doing much of the work.  It is well known there are many women throughout this country who are basically keeping the farm going, as Ms Quinn-Mulligan has rightly pointed out.  What are the obstacles the witnesses face?  Do they face sexism in the whole industry, that someone would look at them and that there is this attitude there?  Is it education as well early on in schools and in the agricultural colleges?  I know the numbers of ladies in the agricultural colleges who are studying agriculture science has gone up a lot.  I have been monitoring that.  What are the steps we need to take to make sure we achieve what the witnesses talked about, the 25% by 2030?  We can have goals, but we need to make sure we get a level playing field.

This is timely and important conversation.  I welcome the work the stakeholders' group has been doing with a very able chair in Ms Quinn-Mulligan.  While she was often scary to us as a journalist, I have no doubt she will be a very able and available source of information to us as we deal with the challenges to ensure the official figures recognise the realities on the ground.<\/p> <p>  To me, to increase the numbers of women farmers, we first need to recognise that women are already farmers.  It is just that the official figures do not acknowledge that.  To me, there are four different areas in terms of how we can address those issues, on which Ms Quinn-Mulligan or the other guests could comment.  First, we had better admit and face up to it that there are cultural issues that need to be addressed on farms and in communities.  Essentially, we have moved to the point where women are quite able.  The reality is they do everything on the farm apart from owning it.  How do we address those cultural barriers?  Second, we need to identify where there are legislative gaps.  I wonder if our guests have any ideas in terms of where legislation is required and where this committee could perhaps start to instigate that.  Third, and this was addressed in the opening statement, there needs to be budgetary consideration.<\/p><p>We have recognised that we cannot encourage transition or new ownership with young farmers without putting in place budgetary measures for that to happen.  Ms Quinn-Mulligan mentioned TAMS, which is a good proposal.  The partnership tax credit also seems like an interesting idea and I would appreciate a little bit of elaboration on that.<\/p><p> The CAP process will be a big part of the work we will be involved in over the next 12 months.  I understand that proposals on women in agriculture were part of the recent CAP negotiations but they did not make it into the final agreement.  Do the witnesses have any views as to why that was the case?  Where did resistance come from?  Was it within the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, the Commission, all of those or none of those?  Did it simply get lost?  Recognising that, what needs to be in the next CAP strategic plan?  From a domestic level, what can we hold up as a barometer and as a first step to show that we are taking seriously the issues Ms Quinn-Mulligan has mentioned when it comes to the future of CAP?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#H00700","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I will hand back to the witnesses and to whoever wants to take the questions from Deputies Fitzmaurice and Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#J00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I am happy to take those.  I thank the Deputies for their questions because they give me a chance to clarify some points.  Deputy Carthy is right that unfortunately a lot of the support measures that were originally in place for women in CAP were dropped.  There are still some fundamental areas in the legal text of CAP to give us a foundation with which to go forward.  If you look at Article 6(1)(h), it specifically states that women have to be supported in the next CAP.  Everyone on the committee knows that it comes down to the member states how that will be articulated.  Part of our mandate is how we think it should be worked out or how we envision it working out.  If we look at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT, analysis, and to come back to Deputy Fitzmaurice, it references cultural bias.  That is the phrase that is used for favouring men over women when it comes to land inheritance.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn Ireland, less than 12% of landholders are women presumably as a result of traditional cultural bias towards male successors, resulting in women rarely inheriting land.  This has had a significant negative impact on the participation of women in agriculture at all levels and has reinforced a perception that farming is a male occupation. <\/blockquote> <p>It also states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThis poses a further challenge as women are often cited as more likely to drive the change necessary to ensure the future viability of some farm enterprises. <\/blockquote> <p>Many of us will agree that there are huge challenges facing agriculture.  Not to incentivise or encourage one half of the farm family to be involved in farms does not make any sense.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Fitzmaurice touched on the numbers in agricultural science courses.  If you look at Teagasc it is worrying because only about 10% of participants in its courses are women.  If you look at UCD, there is a higher proportion and it is a 50:50 split.  If you listen to Dr. Monica O'Gorman, who was on &quot;CountryWide&quot;  a couple of weeks ago, she will tell you that the majority of the men are going into primary agriculture roles such as dairy when it comes to specifying it later on in the course but that women are more often going into innovation roles because they know they will not inherit the land.  That is scary to me because it goes back to agriculture facing all of these challenges.  We cannot spark some kind of brain drain in agriculture.  We need young men and women coming back to farms to face all of those challenges.  Education is something we need to look at.<br\/><br\/>We got a freedom of information, FOI, request back from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the last knowledge transfer, KT, scheme.  Overall, out of around 20,000 participants, just 3,000 were women.  If you break that down to individual counties, in Wicklow, for example, only two women took part in that scheme.  In Longford, only three women took part in it.  These are low numbers.  The idea behind female-only KT schemes is not to create any form of segregation because the mixed schemes will still be there for anyone who wants to take part in them.  They will be there to create the environment where you can ask questions, including technical questions, about your farm without being made to feel stupid.  There are fantastic men out there and I have received so much support from men, but if you are in a minority in any situation, whether you are a woman or a man walking into a room, to put up your hand and ask a question can be very difficult.  For example, I was one of three women with about 100 men doing my green certificate in Pallaskenry.  As supportive as the management and teachers were, I hated asking questions or putting my hand up because the lads would be either trying to take Snapchat videos or they would be staring you out of it.  That is the idea behind the female-only KT schemes.  We are not necessarily saying that any extra funding is needed for those but we are saying it would be incorporated into the KT programme itself.  I might bring in Ms Kiely O'Connor or Ms Crowley on this at some point because they are part of a female-only discussion group that started organically and they find it very supportive.<br\/><br\/>I want to touch on Deputy Carthy's questions as well.  He talked about the cultural issues and I would say that, traditionally, people have thought of the physical barriers before women.  My tractor does not know if a man or woman is turning the key in the ignition.  I am a beef farmer but I have been known to milk cows in my lifetime as well.  When you come down to it, the buttons on a milking machine and a washing machine are not different.  Anyone who says differently has not turned on a washing machine in a while.  The physical barriers that were in place are not there anymore so that cannot be used as an excuse.<br\/><br\/>A big part of the partnership tax credit we are thinking of is that it works similarly to the succession tax credit.  It runs for a five-year period and it is there to encourage bringing in women over 40 years of age who are already working on farms in a formal capacity.  This will give them the recognition they deserve and need, but work is also being done by my colleague, Ms Kiely O'Connor, who is the ICMSA representative.  She has looked into the likes of the McKinsey &amp;amp; Company report, which states that farms and businesses become more economically viable and productive when a partnership is in place.  It does not just make sense as an inclusivity factor; it also makes sense as an economic factor.<br\/><br\/>Ms Kiely O'Connor might share why she finds the female-only discussion group beneficial, she might share some of her thoughts on partnerships and she might give us a rundown on her background.  She is a Limerick native but she has ended up dairy farming in County Cork.  I would welcome her sharing some of her thoughts on those matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Hannah Quinn-Mulligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank members for being here.

I still cannot get over the fact that, in 2018, she was the first ever female in the role.  From that perspective &ndash; I am not being critical &ndash; do the representative organisations, which are male dominated, have an agenda to try to encourage more activism on the part of the female farming community?<\/p> <p>  My last question is on cultural and societal issues.  How can we prevent elderly farmers from being very wary about, or dead set against, signing over their land to a daughter for fear that, when she marries, she will change her name?  How do we overcome the fear of land no longer being in the family name?  This is one of the main barriers preventing succession involving a daughter as opposed to a son.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#K00900","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for one of the better submissions this committee has received in my time as a member, or in the past 12 months.  I am especially happy to see three Limerick women here today.  Obviously, Limerick is leading the way when it comes to women in farming.<\/p> <p>  I have one point to make with respect to the composition of this committee.  Senator Boylan, who is present, is our only female member.  This is a matter we should consider as a committee.  There is no gender balance on the committee.  We must be mindful, as we go forward, of trying to seek a balance.  We have to hold our hands up and say we do not have a balance at the minute.  By not having one, I do not believe we can address the issues our guests are talking about in the way we should.<\/p> <p>  My question has been covered by previous speakers.  If we are to have more women in farming, we have to look to school-leavers and younger women in particular.  In that context and in the context of CAP, I am interested in hearing from Ms Crowley, who is representing Macra na Feirme.  My question has been asked and, perhaps, to some extent answered in the contributions by Ms Kiely O'Connor and Ms Quinn-Mulligan.  We have heard repeatedly how difficult it is to get young people into farming.  It seems it must be exponentially more difficult to get young women into farming.  I would like to believe, in the context of CAP, that this is being examined seriously.  I would like to hear more about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#K01000","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank both members for their questions.  I will answer Senator Daly's question, and if Ms Crowley wants to answer Deputy Leddin's question, we can work it that way.  On the Senator's first point, it is really heartening to see all the farming organisations coming together on this.  When I reached out to people to form the group initially, the support I received from them was overwhelming.  That was fantastic to see.  Many of them were wondering themselves how they could go about doing what we are doing.  I am not saying all were doing so but all of them gave a positive response.  I am happy to say Irish Grain Growers has asked to be part of the group, and we are accepting its application at our next quarterly meeting.  That would be a big deal for us.  When we look at knowledge transfer scheme figures, we see that just 53 women in the entire scheme took part in the tillage section.  That is not good enough and something we need to work on.  I am very happy that ICOS has reached out and would also like to join the group.  We are going to accept it too.  Many people in the room might know that four out of the five major dairy processors do not have a single female farmer elected to their boards.  In 2021, we have to ask if that is good enough in our most valuable indigenous industry, agriculture.  I would say it is not.<\/p> <p>  While farm organisation support has been fantastic and the outpouring of support from women has been brilliant, the desired change will never happen without the support of men.<\/p><p>We have received support from men privately by email or Instagram and other social media, but it will not happen without the support of the members of the committee and it will not happen without the support of people in government.  This is why it is fantastic to be invited here today to get our points across.  Ultimately, this is not about making women superior, it is just about equality.  It is about putting a temporary measure in place in the next Common Agricultural Policy cycle in Ireland that will help to level the playing field.<\/p><p> With regard to younger women, I love going to the National Ploughing Championships every year just to see how enthusiastic the young women are.  I am a Hereford breeder, and I should not admit it but in the Angus competition the young women who come from non-farming backgrounds were just so enthusiastic about farming, it is really heartening to see.  There are young women out there.  It is devastating that fewer than 500 young women under the age of 35 received farm payments.  When we put that figure on social media, a lot of them were unaware of that.  This is why we got so much support from them.  We have a generation of women now growing up who always considered themselves farmers.  How do we translate this into actual farm ownership?  I think it is a question of when you see it you can be it.  If we see more women going to knowledge transfer events, if we see them becoming more involved in farming organisations, and if we see them being elected to the boards of co-ops, that is how we will do it.  It is to be hoped some of the measures we are putting in place will ensure this happens.<\/p><p> I am not going to ignore Senator Daly's question about the name.  I am aware I have a very long one myself, which I have inherited, and there are a couple of other women on here with very long names.  It is a really important element.  Places in Ireland are known as Ryan's farm or O'Donoghue's farm and that kind of thing.  They are landmarks.  It is 2021, however, and I promise that the worst thing that will happen with a double-barrelled name is that the children will just learn the alphabet that much faster.  It is not a big deal anymore and it should not be considered a big deal anymore.  If the name is that important, it can just be turned into a double-barrelled version or a woman can keep her maiden name in a marriage.  It should not be the deal breaker at this stage.  If the farmer in the family is a woman and she is the better farmer, then ideally the farm should go to her.  That is it.  I will pass over to Ms Crowley now for Deputy Leddin's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Hannah Quinn-Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I will follow up on Ms Quinn-Mulligan's last point on the maiden name issue.  There are quite a number of farmers, especially in the dairy sector, that for business reasons have gone into companies.  The actual family name issue is not as big anymore.  I know that, for myself, I would hope to get married at one point.  Because my farm has a farm name, which is a company name, I do not believe that losing my maiden name would be an issue.  It is something you can work around.<\/p> <p>  On the question of getting younger people into farming and how we tackle this, I believe there is a significant element lacking in education from the ground up.  Some programmes are starting up with primary schools such as face time with a farmer and getting that farmer into the classroom to educate our young children so that they know people, including women, are out there farming and that it is an option.<\/p> <p>  Like Ms Quinn-Mulligan, I went to an agricultural college.  I went on to an institute afterwards, but when I did my leaving certificate in 2013, I was in the last year to do agricultural science in that school.  This was a country school in Croom in County Limerick.  That year 20 students chose to do agricultural science for their leaving certificate and I was the only farmer on the course.  There were 19 people from outside of the industry who took an interest and yet the school pulled the subject.  Anyone since has had to avail of the subject outside of school hours if he or she wants to be educated on it.  With rural schools especially, farming is around them and the schools should be providing agricultural science on the curriculum.<\/p> <p>  I went on to an agricultural college, and as with Ms Quinn-Mulligan, there were 107 lads on my course and I was the only female.  It was not an issue for me but the agricultural college felt obliged to ring me before the course started to ask me if I was going to be comfortable to attend as the only female, or did I want to go to another college like University of Limerick or Cork Institute of Technology.  It did not bother me.  I knew what I wanted to do and I was going to go farming, but the educational element could turn other women away from it instead of opening their arms and trying to overcome any issues they might have.  We really must stop viewing a woman going into an agricultural course as something special.  We are more than capable of doing the jobs, and with some elements such as the rearing of the calves and the milking of the cows, a lot of people would say we are far better.  Maybe it is the maternal instincts or having more patience.  There is a lot we can bring to it that is better than our male counterparts.  It is not there in the education system, however, and it is not giving enough of the chance to get people into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I welcome the new group and it is brilliant to see.  I totally agree with what Ms Crowley has just said.  Education is vital for all of this to change.  It is not just about changing attitudes in the farming sectors.  Attitudes need to change right across the board.<\/p> <p>  I just want to put it out there in response to Deputy Leddin's remarks that I believe Tipperary is leading the way in that we have chairpersons in the north and south Tipperary Irish Farmers Association, respectively, Imelda Walsh and Erica O'Keeffe, who are there before us leading the way.<\/p> <p>  I have spent 40 years in and around the farming sector.  I have no doubt about the figures from the CSO about the 70,000 women because I have seen for 40 years how hard they work on farms and they continue to do so.  As Ms Quinn-Mulligan has said, when somebody is sitting on that seat the tractor, does not know if it is a female or a male who is turning the key.<\/p> <p>  The freedom of information figures show that just 4% of TAMS payments are made to women.  The group is proposing 60% of TAMS grants for all female farmers.  In what way is the group working to bring that around?<\/p> <p>  This committee has heard before about the organic sector in Ireland and that it is lagging behind in terms of progress.  It was reported recently that approximately 25% of licensed organic operators and women.  Will the witnesses explain to the committee what they believe are the reasons this percentage of female participation is vastly above the percentage of overall female representation in farming?<\/p> <p>  I would be interested if the witnesses could expand their views on the issue of succession, which is predominantly along the male side of the family.  What are the witnesses' views on tackling the traditions, which the witnesses touched on a while back, as well as the technical aspects such as the CAP and overall policy?<\/p> <p>  Before I finish I must say I believe the group will have widespread support from the committee in achieving what it is out to achieve, and I think I can speak for all of the committee here.  As Senator Daly has said, their male counterparts could take a lesson from that group whereby if everybody would work together, it would be easier to progress things along.  It is easier for a committee to support people if everybody is singing from the one hymn sheet.  I congratulate the group and I offer the witnesses the best of luck and continued support going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021092100002#L00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I welcome the speakers.  As somebody from Dublin it is very interesting to be listening to this discussion on women in farming.  I sympathise with Ms Crowley.

The witnesses have answered a lot of the questions with the previous speakers, but is there a formal education programme?<\/p><p>It is right to get in at primary school level because students make choices as they progress to secondary school and their choice of subjects dictates the path they will take.  Are there formal education programmes to go in at primary school and follow up in transition year to reinforce the point that there is a future for women in farming and they should consider farming?<\/p><p> Agriculture is changing and we are in a transitional phase.  Does that open up new opportunities?  Ms Quinn-Mulligan is right that it makes no difference who is operating machinery but is there something to the fact that there are more women involved in organic farming?

I was speaking in the Seanad.  It is great to have this group before the committee.  This is an important day.  We need to promote women in agriculture and also acknowledge the women who are in agriculture.  My mother, who is 72 years of age, has worked all her life on the family farm.  There is a legacy issue that needs to be addressed, in particular in respect of pensions.  Women who worked at home and did not pay PRSI were not on the books and the only reason for that was poor accountancy.  That is a significant legacy issue affecting many rural families and it must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Role models such as Caroline Walsh are important.  Women who are role models in agriculture need to be promoted.  We need to step up to the mark and start talking about the real female leaders we have in agriculture.  I attend agricultural meetings almost weekly at this stage and they are 90% male.  Farming is a male-orientated and male-dominated space and it is going to be very hard to bridge the gap and get females into that space.  Certain strong-minded, tough, focused do that well.  My 11-year-old daughter who is very shy farms with me at home at weekends.  I do not know if she would manage in that kind of a scenario.  We need to start thinking about how to help get people like her involved in farming at that basic level.<\/p> <p>  The TAMS figures are crazy - off the Richter scale in many ways.  We have a scheme in place for young farmers.  We are discussing parity here and how we achieve it.  We have an opportunity to have young farmers and female participation in agriculture treated in the same way.  That would be a real driver in the industry to ensure we achieve the parity we need.  <\/p> <p>  This is also a cultural issue.  The current generation of farmers is predominately made up of males aged over 55 years.  Changing the ethos will take an awful lot of work and thinking outside of the box.  Campaigns, role models and leaders are really important.  I see this with the veterinary practice we use at home.  Two of its best vets are females.  When they come into the yard my two little girls jump for joy because they see what can happen on the ground.  These are the kinds of role models we need to see.  People want to get involved when they see that kind of activity on the ground.  <\/p> <p>  This is an important engagement but it cannot be our last one.  We must have ongoing dialogue to go over issues in the agricultural industry that need to be addressed and ensure we have parity and female participation at a very high level.

On the points raised about TAMS, the idea is to provide a 60% grant for women over the age of 40, but there would be a clause included to make sure it is not abused.  There would have to be a formal partnership arrangement in place whereby over a five-year period, the farm would have to be divided 50:50.  This is to encourage more male-female partnerships for women over the age of 40 and farming with their husbands, for example.  There would be a clause included to make sure it is not taken advantage of.<\/p> <p>  On education, Ms Kiely O'Connor made a good point about having a ground-up approach in primary schools.  Senator Lombard also made a good point about role models.  If some of these policies are put in place, younger women will see older women more visibly active on farms.  They are currently active but they are not visible.  That is a big part of the issue for us.<\/p> <p>  I refer to agricultural meetings.  Three of the women at this meeting have rearranged their milking time.  They should have been milking cows at this time.  This is major issue for us, which we included in our submission, and needs to be taken into account when agricultural meetings are being arranged, be they farm organisation or Department meetings.  I refer to the CAP consultation plan, for example.  The Department had three meetings in a row, all of which were held at the exact same time - between 7 and 9 o'clock.  A number of women contacted me to say they could not join those meetings because they had a full day at work, they were running around working on the farm, and then had to put their kids to bed or do something to get them ready for school the next day.

The package collectively aims to make the EU&rsquo;s climate, energy, land use, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, in line with the decision of the European Council.  The European climate law regulation, adopted in June 2021, has now given legal effect to the targets adopted by the EU Heads of State and Government.  The package is extensive and is currently being analysed and considered by both our Department and other Departments that have a role in it.  In parallel, the recent enactment by the Oireachtas of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 sets Ireland on a similarly ambitious decarbonisation trajectory for 2030, but it must be stressed that there are two distinct targets, each with its own measurement and compliance regimes.  The committee has indicated it wishes to focus specifically in its session today on the proposals to extend the EU emissions trading system to new sectors, COM (21) 551, and to establish a social climate fund, COM (21) 568.  The committee has received information notes from the Department on both of these proposals but I will briefly set out the key elements of each.<\/p> <p>  The EU emissions trading system, ETS, is a key pillar of EU climate policy architecture.  The sectors it covers, primarily electricity and heavy industry, are obliged to achieve a 43% reduction in their emissions by 2030 relative to 2005 levels.  The new proposal seeks to increase this target to 61% and to incorporate emissions from maritime transport within the overall cap.  This will be achieved by a steeper annual reduction in the available allowances of 4.2% instead of 2.2% per year under the current system, following a one-off reduction of the overall emissions cap by 117 million allowances, also known as \"re-basing\".  The Commission also proposes to gradually remove free emissions allowances for the aviation sector, which is already covered by the EU ETS for domestic and intra-EU flights, and to move to full auctioning of allowances by 2027 to create a stronger price signal to drive emissions reduction in the sector.  Accompanying changes to the system&rsquo;s market stability reserve will allow the system to absorb the historical surplus of allowances more quickly to help achieve this more ambitious overall cap.<\/p> <p>  The Commission is also proposing to extend the ETS to fuels used in road transport and buildings and for these to be covered by a separate cap, with distinct trading arrangements to the current system.  The new system will operate at the point at which transport and heating fuels are placed on the market rather than at the point of end use.  This will place the obligation on fuel suppliers, rather than households or drivers, to hold a greenhouse gas emissions permit, to report their emissions and to hold and surrender allowances to cover those emissions.  It is proposed to become operational from 2025, with a cap on emissions set from 2026 and with the objective of reducing emissions annually to yield an overall reduction of 43% in 2030 compared to 2005.  The Commission proposal indicates that the overall objective of this proposal is to ensure that sectors other than those currently included in the ETS contribute cost-effectively to the emission reductions needed in line with EU targets and Paris Agreement commitments, while ensuring synergies with other policies targeting those sectors.<\/p> <p>  To address the potential impacts arising from the fact that the fuel suppliers subject to this new regime are likely to pass on some of their costs to consumers buying road transport and heating fuels, the Commission has also presented a separately legislative proposal for a new social climate fund.  This proposal recognises that increases in the price for fossil fuels will have social and distributional impacts that may disproportionately affect those households, microenterprises or transport users who spend a larger part of their incomes on energy and transport and who may not have access to alternative transport solutions.  This could be achieved through temporary income support or investments intended to reduce, in the medium to long term, the reliance on fossil fuels through improving the energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonisation of heating and cooling of buildings, integrating energy from renewable sources and the provision of improved access to zero- and low-emission transport.  The proposal anticipates that a portion of the auctioning revenue from the new ETS for buildings and road transport will be allocated to the EU budget and from there to the member states for expenditure through the social climate fund.<\/p> <p>  Each member state will be required to develop a social climate plan, which will set out the measures and investments that will be financed from the new fund, as well as their expected costs and milestones and targets to achieve them.  Each social climate plan should, first, provide vulnerable households, vulnerable microenterprises and vulnerable transport users with the necessary resources to finance and carry out investments in energy efficiency and decarbonisation of heating and cooling in zero- and low-emission vehicles and mobility, and, second, mitigate the impact of the increase in the cost of fossil fuels on the most vulnerable and prevent energy and transport poverty.  It is proposed that &euro;737 million will be allocated to Ireland over the period for the first social climate plan from 2025 to 2032.<\/p><p>Member state allocations are calculated under the proposal according to an allocation key, taking into account population at risk of poverty living in rural areas, emissions from fuel use in households, households at risk of poverty with arrears on their utility bills, gross national income, GNI, and the member state&rsquo;s share of reference emissions for the buildings and road transport sectors.  Member states will be required to contribute at least 50% of the total costs of their social climate plan, with the costs of this expected to be borne by member states&rsquo; share of auctioning revenues from the buildings and road transport sectors.  A total fund of &euro;1.474 billion would, therefore, be required for Ireland&rsquo;s social climate plan over the seven years concerned.<\/p><p> The proposal to apply a separate trading system to road transport and buildings and to use revenues from the new system to finance the social climate fund would potentially reduce the funding available for Ireland&rsquo;s own measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In accordance with the programme for Government, revenue from increases in carbon tax is to be ring-fenced for climate purposes and is a key part of funding a just transition through targeted social welfare measures that protect vulnerable households against fuel poverty, fund socially progressive retrofitting schemes and partially fund a rural environment protection scheme 2, REPS 2, encouraging the uptake of greener and more sustainable farming methods.  Government policy is not to levy a carbon tax in sectors of the economy included in the emissions trading system as this would amount to a form of double taxation.  As the sectors proposed for inclusion in the new ETS for road transport and buildings are also subject to a carbon tax, this would require the Government to reduce the scope of application of this tax, therefore affecting expected future revenue from the carbon tax.<\/p><p> While a share of auction revenues from the new ETS would accrue to the State and funds would be made available to Ireland from the EU budget under the new social climate fund, these revenues are likely be significantly lower than those raised by the carbon tax.  It might be noted in this context that the full year yield from carbon tax in 2020 was approximately &euro;495 million, when the applicable rate was &euro;26 per tonne.  As the committee will be aware, the Oireachtas has also legislated for an annual schedule of increases in the rate of carbon tax through the Finance Act, which provides that the rate will reach &euro;100 per tonne by 2030.  I should stress that the Department and several other Departments are continuing to examine the implications of both proposals in light of the issues that have been identified and in the context of the wider Fit for 55 package.  The Minister proposes to brief the Government on the Department&rsquo;s initial assessments with a view to informing the position to be taken during the negotiations on each of the proposals in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  We are very happy to take any questions the committee members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Maughan.

One is in respect of your final comments, Mr. Maughan, on the carbon tax.  Is this an either-or situation or would it be the case that this climate fund could co-exist with the carbon tax, the schedule of which is planned through to 2030?  He might elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  Second, perhaps he could give some clarity on how an ETS for transport and buildings might work.  It is not particularly clear to me.  I am quite familiar with the ETS that has been in existence for a long time at this point.  It is very much about incentivising the end user to reduce emissions and reducing a cap in that market gradually over time.  That has been successful, but I am not clear how it would work where it is essentially the producer or fuel suppliers, as I read it, that would be required to operate in this new proposed ETS.  Perhaps he would elaborate on how that might work versus the existing system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#C00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Before I begin, for the information of the committee, Mr. Regan and I are both attending to cover each of the proposals.

The EU ETS covers electricity generation and large industry, and the carbon tax is not levied in those sectors, but is levied in other sectors of the economy where fossil fuels are used.  By extension of that policy, it would have implications for the future scope of the carbon tax.  That is not necessarily to say it is automatic.  This is a policy question and Government has not taken a policy position on it yet.  It is to draw the attention of the committee to this issue which arises by virtue of the proposal to extend the ETS into the road transport and heating sectors where the carbon tax currently applies.<\/p><p> The second question relates to the operation of the ETS in the new sectors and I will pass over to Mr. Regan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I will describe what the European Commission is proposing in terms of road transport and buildings.  First, it is important to say that the current EU system for road transport and buildings falls within the effort sharing decision.  Those two sectors plus agriculture and some others fall within the effort sharing decision which essentially means that each member state has a binding national target by which to reduce its emissions.  Ireland's current national target is 30% by 2030.  The Commission is proposing to keep the effort sharing decision and the national targets for these areas, but in addition it proposes to add this new system which provides carbon pricing for road transport and buildings.  It is essentially a separate emissions trading system from the one currently in place for electricity generation and industry.  It is completely separate with no linkages.<\/p> <p>  It is intended to commence from 2026 and, as pointed out by the Chair, it will not be applied at the point of emission as is currently the case for the ETS.  Rather it is applied at the point of release of consumption of fuels.  Essentially at the same place excise duty is applied, this new ETS system will be applied.  That is where the monitoring and accounting would take place.  What it does is that if a fuel supplier releases their fuel, they must have an equivalent certificate from the EU scheme, equivalent to the amount of emissions caused by that fuel.  The certificates available will be limited over time, and they will reduce each year in order to reach minus 43% emissions reduction by 2030.  This is a market which gets more scarce over time for the emissions to be released, which essentially puts a price on the carbon.<\/p> <p>  Another important point is that there will be a separate market stability reserve which will be used to dampen price fluctuations because it will be a market based mechanism so, unlike the carbon tax that is in place at the moment where there is price certainty, we can expect that carbon prices will fluctuate.  That market will be in place from 2026.  There will be a trial period of reporting only in the years 2024 and 2025.  That is two years of testing followed by implementation from 2026, with a reducing amount of allowances available each year to 2030.  Unlike the current system for large industry there will be no free allowances.  Everybody must get an allowance for the fuel when it is released.<\/p> <p>  The emissions savings as a result of this will count against each member state's target but it is a separate complementary mechanism, as proposed by the Commission.  It is not intended to replace the current member states' national targets for these sectors.  That is an overview of the current position.  I would note that member states have many questions in regard to how this will be applied and how it will work in practice, because it is quite a complex system to implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Regan.

My question is for Mr. Maughan.  I would like to tease out where he got that 737 million allocation for Ireland under the social climate fund.  Why is only 25% of the ETS going to be allocated to the social climate fund?  On the allocation key Mr. Maughan referred to in the opening statement, we do not really know the extent of fuel poverty in Ireland so how have we identified those households?  I know the 2015 report commissioned by the Department, when it used the objective indicator, said that fuel poverty could be as high as 28% and even as high as 50% in the north west.  The later report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2020 said we actually do not have sufficient data to use that objective measure from the 2015 report.  The fuel poverty strategy lapsed in 2019.  We were told we would have the Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicators to better measure fuel poverty by the close of 2020.  How have we arrived at the figure of 737 million and what indicators did the Department submit to the EU to get that figure?  I also ask Mr. Maughan to touch on why it is only 25% of the ETS that is going to the social climate fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#E00400","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The first part of the question relates to the amount of 737 million.  This is an outcome of the key that has been set out in the legislative proposal for assessing the distribution of the revenues that will accrue to the EU budget from the social climate fund, and that amount is included as an annexe to the legislative proposal.  It is broken down to 242 million in the three years 2025 to 2027 and a further 495 million in the years 2028 to 2032.  The reason it is broken down in that way is that the Commission is proposing that the revenues will be allocated to the EU budget, and the budget runs on a seven-year cycle which ends in 2027.  I understand that, from a legal point of view, the Commission needs to separate everything out into two separate sub-periods.  That explains that.<\/p> <p>  As a share of the overall total available for the social climate fund, Ireland's allocation would approximately be just over 1% of the overall fund and that is broadly in line with Ireland's share of population.  I will reiterate the elements of the allocation key: population at risk of poverty living in rural areas, emissions from fuel use in households, households at risk of poverty with arrears on their utility bills, gross national income, and the member state's share of reference emissions for the sectors concerned, that is, buildings and road transport sectors.<\/p><p>Thus the Commission does not specifically look at fuel poverty <i>per se<\/i>but it does take data which is published data and which is available to it and to everybody else from EUROSTAT and other published sources.  Data on utility bills, for example, will be available to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  This is based on the Commission's own examination of the data, not on data submitted by the Department.  This is obviously one of the things we will drill further into as the examination of this proposal progresses.<br\/><br\/>As to Senator Boylan's question on why limit it to 25%, that is not something I can answer too specifically.  It is what the proposal states.  The expectation is that of the share of revenues from the extended ETS, 25% will go to the EU budget.  Another portion will be allocated to an EU-managed innovation fund, which is an existing fund in place as part of the EU ETS competitive fund for the promotion of new technologies.  The remainder will be allocated to member states' budgets as auctioning revenues.  That is the broad breakdown of how the revenues will be allocated.  The Commission has chosen 25% for its own reasons.  It does not make a clear justification for that in the proposal but clearly the higher you go in terms of the percentage the more fluidity there is going to be about the revenues coming from the new ETS because as a market-based mechanism, the price of allowances in the scheme is likely to fluctuate, as is the case in the existing scheme.  In principle it would be difficult to fix a total amount that could or would be made to the social climate fund at a higher percentage.  I hope that answers the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I just want to clarify something.

The Commission has chosen a number of different statistics to go about constructing the allocation key.  The Senator is correct in identifying issues around the identification of households in fuel poverty.  The data on that is not as clear but there is clearly much work to be done to negotiate this proposal and to determine how member states should be able to prepare a social climate plan and to justify their proposed interventions to the Commission as part of that social climate plan.<\/p> <p>  It is very early days in terms of the questions the Senator is raising about the statistics.

I have referred the committee to the tax strategy group paper published by the Department of Finance last week, which sets out these data in some detail, as part of the annual pre-budget consideration of taxation options.  On the other side of the equation, we have clear data from the Commission proposal about how much of an allocation Ireland would be expected to get over the seven years of the proposal.  There is a difference between the two figures.  The annual carbon tax revenues are much higher than the average annual allocation Ireland would receive under this proposal.  It is not necessarily the case that all sources of carbon tax would be supplanted by this.  There are potentially other sources of carbon tax application which would not be covered by the EU emissions trading system, EU ETS, proposal.  The big issue that will be at play in the negotiations will be precisely where the EU ETS will land and what sectors it will cover.  That will impact on this too.  There are a number of different elements to this, which are all moving parts as the negotiations under the two proposals progress.

We have a lower amount of heavy industry than is typical and our agricultural emissions are higher than the average of other member states.<\/p><p>Looking at how they compare, 2030 is a key staging point for both.  The EU target is at least a 55% reduction compared with 1990 levels.  The climate Act states that there should be a 51% reduction from 2018 emissions.  The Deputy has correctly pointed out that the bases are different and, therefore, a comparison is difficult.  It is important to state that the emissions target for the ETS for large industry and electricity is an EU-wide target, so the 61% is not for member states but for the EU.  All that said, this depends on what assumptions are applied.  It is safe to assume that the climate action policy will be as ambitious in 2030 as the EU package.  Certain assumptions could be changed but that is safe to say at a high level.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's question about the sectors and how we track them, it is important to state that both our inventory for the national system and the EU system will be based on the IPCC guidelines.

The proposal as published by the Commission envisages that member states would prepare and submit a social climate plan by the end of 2024.  It has directly linked that to an existing deadline for member states to update their NECPs, which are in place to set out how they will meet their current climate and energy targets under the pre-existing 2030 targets framework.<\/p><p>The NECP has to be updated by mid-2024 and the Commission is proposing that the social climate plan will be submitted alongside that.  There is then a process whereby the Commission assesses the plan alongside the NECP.  Clearly, they will be looking for coherence between the two.  They will also be looking for coherence with member states' planned use of other EU funds, be it the Structural Fund or the Recovery and Resilience Facility, Ireland's plan for which has now been approved by the Commission.  There is a fairly extensive process envisaged on the Commission side and then the Commission will formally adopt a decision to approve the plan for the member state after which it can commence expenditure.<\/p><p> On the second part of the question regarding the overlap, the Commission is presenting the proposal effectively as if nothing is happening in the sectors already in terms of the types of interventions.  It does not address the question of whether member states can continue to do what they are doing.  This is one of the points that needs to be teased out.  What they say is that the funding can be used for two types of measures.  The first of these are temporary income support measures.  That is the type of measure the Deputy raised in respect of current types of social welfare supports.  That is the type of measure that is contemplated there.  The second type of measure is more in the line of household investments.  That will be issues such as energy efficiency - retrofitting of buildings, installing zero-carbon heating or, as the case may be, cooling systems such as heat pumps - installing renewable energy, for example, photovoltaic panels on the roofs of houses, and supports for access to zero-emissions mobility, which could be, for example, supports for the uptake of electric vehicles along the lines of the grants that are currently available from the SEAI.<\/p><p> It is clear that, across the various types of interventions, the Commission contemplates that Ireland is already doing a lot of these things.  The question we cannot answer right now is to what extent they will continue in parallel.  On the face of it, they could because if it is not separately being funded by the EU budget, there is nothing to prevent the Government continuing to fund those measures domestically.  It would give rise to questions of alignment and coherence.  One thing that comes out from the Commission proposal is that it anticipates that member states, through their social climate plans, will establish clear targets and indicators for what they will achieve by their proposed investments under the social climate plan and the release of funds from the Commission to the member states is contingent on the achievement of those targets.  It entails quite a degree of oversight by the Commission in terms of the expenditure of funding under the social climate plans and that would, in turn, give rise to questions about how money is spent in parallel through the Exchequer.  These are all issues that will have to be teased through in understanding how the types of interventions under the social climate plan would fit into the policy interventions and funding interventions the Government has in place or has planned over the coming years.<\/p><p> The other questions are related to the scope of the sectors that are proposed to be brought into the ETS.  I will ask Mr. Regan to take those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I will speak to the scope of the sectors and I think the Deputy also asked about the success of the ETS to date.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the scope of the sectors, its is buildings and road transport.

Aviation is already in the current emissions trading system for intra-EU flights and flights within the EU are in the ETS.  However, there are considerable free allowances to the airline operators and a proposal now is to phase them out by 2027 so that, essentially, airlines would pay the full price of carbon from 2027.  For international flights outside the EU, there is a new agreement being put in place, called Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, CORSIA.  That is a worldwide system and that would be for flights outside the EU.<\/p><p> In terms of maritime transport, the Commission in its impact assessment has identified that, in the absence of an intervention in the maritime transport area, essentially emissions will not drop by 2050.  This is largely an oil-based system.  They have a new proposal to include maritime transport within the main ETS, but not in the buildings and road transport one.

In fairness, it has been complemented by a renewables target which has been particularly successful in increasing renewables but the ETS has certainly played a role.  At a high carbon price, we will switch coal to gas which can reduce emissions.<\/p> <p>  The Commission essentially is saying that a price signal is needed to complement the transport and buildings sector and that, in the absence of it, the existing policies are not working.

Buildings offers many cost-competitive ways to decarbonise, but in the absence of a price signal, that can be quite difficult.<\/p> <p>  The Innovation Fund is a feature of the ETS.  Basically, money goes to large industry to innovate and decarbonise large factories etc.  That is a key part of the proposal.

That is before we even consider the situation with transport needs.  It was mentioned that it was early days in this context, but I regard this as more like the end days.

Those changes included increases in qualifying child payments, living alone allowances and fuel allowances and they were introduced specifically to respond to the increase in the rate of carbon tax, with a specific intention to counteract the effects in different household types.  They were based on an analysis undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, prior to the budget.

It seems odd that it is 25% in this but they are asking for 50% in the existing ETS for climate-related issues.<\/p> <p>  The officials may not be able to answer this and I can refer back, but we were promised CSO indicators would come into place in 2020 to better identify those households which would be impacted by energy poverty.  Is there any indication of when we will see those CSO indicators as they are a crucial part of our doing those climate plans?  The programme for Government commits social transfers to address fuel poverty but we need to be able to identify the households which are most at risk and which would most benefit from retrofitting.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform admits that we do not have that data and that is why the CSO was asked to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#P00100","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>On the 50% versus 25%, the current emissions trading directive requires that at least 50% of revenue generated from auctions must be used by member states to finance climate-related activities.

However, that is not directly comparable with the 25% figure in the current proposal because that figure relates to the amount of revenues that should be effectively diverted to the EU budget for the social climate fund.

Of the revenues from both the current ETS and the buildings and transport, the proposal is that 25% the new buildings and transport goes to the social fund outlined by Mr. Maughan.

The first is to the innovation fund, a cross-EU fund to which large industry, such as cement and steel, can apply to try to reduce their emissions.  It is open to all member states.  That gets subtracted first.  The second is a modernisation fund, which is only available to member states whose GDP is 65% lower than the EU average and especially to support countries with a large coal power generation sector in which significant transformation has to take place.  The third subtraction is EU own resources for the funding of the EU institutions, for which a proposal is expected in the coming months.  What is left is allocated among member states and that cuts to Deputy's question.  That is based on the emissions from the member states.  It is carved out on where the emissions occurred.  It is a complex methodology but, in principle, that is how it follows.  It follows the same principle as the current system.  That picks up Senator Boylan's point, in that of the money left to the member state, the current rule is that 50% must be submitted to climate-related projects.

I would be cautious about inferring from those numbers because carbon tax is always only one of a number of policy tools in place across government to try to reduce emissions in the sectors on which it is levied.

First, I join the Chairman in congratulating Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan and Senator Flynn and their families.  It is a wonderful family time.  Best wishes to them all.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by a number of departmental officials today, including in Kildare House, by Ms Deirdre Shanley, Ms Martina Mannion, Mr. Hubert Loftus, Ms Yvonne Keating and Ms Anne Tansey.  In its invitation, the committee set three important topics for discussion today.  I look forward to hearing the views of committee members on these topics.<\/p> <p>  I will turn first to the safe and sustainable reopening of schools.  I wish to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of all of the education partners working together with the Department of Education and with public health to ensure our schools could remain operational throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  The safe return and sustained safe reopening of our schools this month has been a key priority across the Government.  We are all aware of the adverse consequences of school closures, which impacts on well-being, on learning and on children's social and emotional development.<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, the Government approved the implementation of a new Covid learning and supports scheme, CLASS, which will help to mitigate the impact of Covid on students' learning and well-being.  This scheme offers additional targeted teaching hours to every primary and post-primary school in the country to support students' learning and well-being in the coming school year.  I have introduced this programme to further mitigate the impacts of the loss of learning caused by school closures.  This programme is in addition to the supplementary programme in spring 2021 and the significantly expanded summer programme which catered for up to 33,000 students.  Overall, more than &euro;100 million has been spent on these measures, in addition to the &euro;639 million which was spent over the last school year to support their operation in a Covid-19 environment.<\/p><p>The Minister of State and I are particularly pleased to be bringing this initiative.<br\/><br\/>Throughout the pandemic, the Department of Education has worked intensively with public health professionals from across the health sector and the HSE to support schools.  We have been guided by their expertise in all we have done.  In advance of reopening, and indeed since schools have reopened, these experts have reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools, and they are satisfied these infection prevention and control measures, when implemented correctly and adhered to, will continue to keep the school community safe.<br\/><br\/>These measures range from the reconfiguration of classrooms and other school spaces to support physical distancing to significant additional funding for additional cleaning and hygiene measures, as well as more than 1,080 additional teaching posts to ensure appropriate distancing can be put in place.  Funding has also been made available for additional administrative leave days for principals and to provide for substitution arrangements.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Education has also issued updated advice to schools on good ventilation practices.  For this new school year we are providing schools with CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors.  These monitors will help to guide schools about when they need to open or close their windows to increase the ventilation.  Some 25,000 CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors have been delivered to schools this week, and 96% of primary schools, including all special schools, have received their full allocation of CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors.  Every post-primary school has received a minimum of ten CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors.<br\/><br\/>Lennox Laboratories was on target to have the full amount of 35,000 CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors delivered to schools shortly.  Unfortunately, however, Lennox Laboratories has been informed by the manufacturer that there is a delay with the delivery of the last batch of 10,000 CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors, due to a fault with the LCD display unit.  While I am disappointed at the news of a delay, Lennox Laboratories has identified options that should enable the remaining balance of CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors to be distributed to schools in late September and early October.  In the interim, the Department has advised schools that if they wish they can make arrangements directly for procuring the balance of their CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors directly themselves rather than via the central arrangements currently in place.<br\/><br\/>Naturally, the safety of our school communities, and indeed broader society, has been greatly bolstered by Ireland&rsquo;s highly successful vaccination programme.  Through the incredible efforts of everyone involved, more than 90% of over-16s have been fully vaccinated, the highest such percentage in the EU, and nearly 87% of over-12s have received their full vaccination.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the second item for discussion today, which is the formal recognition, sustainable funding and teaching posts for Cork Life Centre.  I am pleased my Department, with support from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, has put in place a very significant package of funding and teaching hours, to which the board of Cork Life Centre has responded positively, stating it recognises it is a welcome step towards securing the sustainability of the centre.<br\/><br\/>Shortly after I was appointed Minister last year, I met with Don O&rsquo;Leary from the Cork Life Centre.  The centre provides a considerable service to a cohort of learners with a diverse range of needs.  The outcomes of what is delivered in Cork Life Centre was evident before this committee last December when students from the centre spoke with passion and clarity about their experiences and how the centre has supported them in their journey through education.  I am pleased, therefore, that significant progress has been made regarding a package of supports that will substantially increase the funding and teaching hours for the centre and will ensure students continue to have the opportunity to access all which the centre has to offer.<br\/><br\/>The final item for today relates to the implementation of the key recommendations in the joint committee report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health.  I thank the Oireachtas joint committee for its work in this area.  For a child or young person, the experience of bullying can be a deeply traumatic one and stands in direct opposition to the sense of security, opportunity, and nourishment we hope all of our students feel in the school system.  I know bullying experienced by even one child or young person is one too many and I commit to doing all we can to prevent its occurrence.  Coming from the school sector, I know how seriously this issue is treated by schools, but I also know we must continue to do all we can to support schools in addressing it directly.<br\/><br\/>The Department has implemented a number of ongoing anti-bullying measures, which include implementing the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools; monitoring of schools&rsquo; anti-bullying measures by the inspectorate; implementation of the well-being policy statement and framework for practice; provision of a greater focus on inclusive education in teacher training; provision of supports for schools in online safety; implementation of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, curriculum; provision of funding to the National Parents' Council for anti-bullying training for parents; provision of funding to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre towards its research and training programmes and for the national anti-bullying website <i>www.tacklebullying.ie<\/i>; provision of funding to <i>Webwise.ie<\/i>to promote the safe use of the Internet and prevent cyberbullying; and the provision of funding to BeLonG To youth services to support delivery of the Stand Up! campaign in post primary schools.<br\/><br\/>I recognise, however, that there is much more work that needs to be done in this area, and I am committed to doing this work.  In this regard, I wish to advise the committee of a number of measures currently being undertaken by my Department.  I am pleased to be able to announce that during this school year the inspectorate is prioritising monitoring and the gathering of information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools across all its inspection types.  As part of this work, the inspectorate will also identify and report on examples of effective practice in preventing and tacking bullying in schools.  This will help provide evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it.<br\/><br\/>Starting this week also, the inspectorate will be looking at bullying matters through a comprehensive programme of incidental inspections in primary and post-primary schools.  These inspections will result in feedback to individual schools about how they are implementing anti-bullying procedures as well as the publication of an interim composite report on how the anti-bullying procedures are being implemented.<br\/><br\/>From the beginning of 2022, the monitoring of anti-bullying measures within schools will be extended to all inspection types and will include looking at the actions of the school to create a positive school culture as well as the implementation of important aspects of the anti-bullying procedures.  The inspectorate will, during quarters 3 and 4 in 2022, carry out focused anti-bullying inspections in schools.<br\/><br\/>I also am pleased to announce to the committee that I have asked my Department to review and update the action plan on bullying and the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools.  This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were first published and will specifically consider areas such as cyberbullying and gender identity bullying.  This work will involve significant collaboration across my Department, with other Departments and bodies and with the national anti-bullying research centre at DCU, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including students.  As part of this work my Department will give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the joint committee's report.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to take this opportunity to advise the committee that I am fully committed to progressing the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As advised during Second Stage, I am bringing forward amendments to the Bill to make it more inclusive of our entire school community.  I am proposing the Bill be amended from a student and parent charter to a school community charter.  It is vitally important the engagement and listening culture the charter provides for is inclusive of the whole school community, which includes staff, students and parents.  Under this Bill, schools will be required to provide a range of information to the school community on school plans and policies such as the school anti-bullying policy and how complaints are dealt with.  While we know very many schools already provide this information, the Bill will allow for consistency.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today, to update on school reopening, to speak on the Cork Life Centre, and to outline the measures the Department is progressing to prevent and tackle bullying in our schools, many of which relate to the excellent recommendations in the joint committee&rsquo;s report.  I particularly want to acknowledge all the hard work that has been done by school communities in recent weeks.  It is wonderful to see students back in their classrooms with their teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and support staff.<br\/><br\/>With the agreement of the Chairman I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#A00700","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I echo the congratulations to Senator Flynn and Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan on their good news.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to update the members on important measures to address the continuing the impact of Covid-19 on the education experience of children and young people.

The issues being discussed today by the committee are very relevant in this context, especially the work of Cork Life Centre, which the Minister has addressed, and include the use of reduced school days by schools and the matter of school bullying, both of which I will talk about later.<\/p> <p>  As members of this committee are aware, the closure of schools for extended periods over the past two years due to Covid restrictions made accessing education much more difficult for this vulnerable group.  We have all heard how remote teaching and learning has been extremely difficult for many children and young people with disabilities.<\/p><p>The break with normal routines, coupled with the absence of the customised teaching and care supports provided in the school environment, deepened the impact of the Covid restrictions on this group of young people and children.  I know from my many encounters with young people and their parents, families and advocacy groups that this impact reaches into the families.  Young people themselves also bear witness to this impact.<\/p><p> The loss of connection with education, school staff and friends was a real concern for families and schools alike.  Notwithstanding the significant investment of &euro;2 billion already being made in special education prior to the pandemic, additional measures were and continue to be required to support this group.  I will outline some of these measures developed and put in place by the Minister and me over recent months, which I believe are making a positive difference to the lives of these children and young people who have been most impacted by Covid-19.<\/p><p> Looking back, the Government was correct to prioritise special education in the reopening of schools earlier this year.  The supplementary programme, which provided a much needed ongoing connection with education through the provision of in-home tuition or care during the period of school closure earlier this year, was much appreciated by families.  I am happy to report that more than 14,000 of the most vulnerable pupils availed of this programme at a cost of more than &euro;10 million.  Building on this theme of connection with education, we have an enhanced suite of summer programmes for children with special educational needs and those who are disadvantaged during the vacation period.  A fund of &euro;40 million has been provided for this purpose.  The level of take up has been very good.  I will know in the coming weeks when all of the claims have been processed exactly how many availed of it.<\/p><p> Under the new Covid learning and support programme, CLASS, which the Minister referenced, every school can draw down additional teaching hours based on enrolment during the 2021-22 school year.  These hours will be used to support those students who, in the schools' opinion, have been impacted upon most by the disrupted school experience of the past two years.  More than &euro;50 million is being set aside for this programme.  At this point, I acknowledge the work of schools, teachers and SNAs who have worked together with families and students through the pandemic period to ensure our schools could reopen on a safe and sustainable basis.<\/p><p> There are two other matters on which I would like to update the committee, both of which impact on the inclusion of students in schools.  These are the use of reduced school days by schools and school bullying.  With regard to the use of reduced school days, I was pleased to announce last week the publication of guidelines in this regard.  The guidelines are intended to ensure reduced school days are used in a limited manner and only where absolutely necessary.  We have taken into account the experiences outlined by parents and advocacy groups in various fora, including at the joint Oireachtas committee.  In addition, we have also taken on board the views expressed by schools and education partners.  A fundamental principle is that the consent of parents is central to the process prior to implementation of a reduced school day.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure there is a consistency in approach.  Where a reduced school day arrangement is put in place, it should be time-bound and a plan to reintegrate the student to full day attendance should form part of the overall process.<\/p><p> We have also committed to ensure robust data collection on the use of reduced school days.  The guidelines will be applicable from 1 January 2022.  From that date, schools will be required to notify Tusla education support service, TESS, when a reduced school day is being put in place.  In the interim, schools are being asked to review arrangements currently in place and, in particular, to review the circumstances of any pupil currently on reduced school days.  This will allow time for transition arrangements for pupils and schools.<\/p><p> On school bullying, I echo the sentiments the Minister has expressed.  We must foster a school culture based on respect and inclusion for children with special educational needs.  When bullying does happen it should be acknowledged and addressed appropriately.  To do this, we need to consider bullying in an holistic manner and we need to take a whole school community approach.<\/p><p> I will continue to look at ways to address ongoing issues of concern for the inclusion of children and young people in education.  In the budget, I will seek to increase as much as possible the level of resources available for teachers and SNAs so that our children and young people with additional needs will continue to have the necessary supports to get an education, which is their entitlement.  This will continue to be my priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#B00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their opening statements.

The adjudication on close contact is made by them, conscious of the environment that exists within a school, which is very different to the environment we find in wider society.  They are also conscious of the infection prevention and control measures that are unique to the school environment.  In some instances, when public health makes its adjudication it analyses the layout of the room and the number of children.  Perhaps a pod may need to be stood down.

It is important that we preface all of our remarks by saying that.  Notwithstanding that and as stated earlier, I am committed to reviewing the action plan on bullying and the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools.  I am committed to doing that as a matter of priority.  My Department is currently drawing together that body of work.  It will involve wide engagement within the education sector and beyond, such as with DCU, an institution with which we have already engaged.  It will be the widest possible engagement.<\/p> <p>  As we sit here today, there are significant new developments on procedures within our schools.  For example, this week alone, a series of incidental inspections will take place.  Our inspectorate, as part of those inspections, will be looking at and reviewing best practice within our schools in terms of bullying and anti-bullying procedures.  It is also my intention that when those incidental inspections have been completed, a composite report will be put together on best practice.  I believe in the shared experience of learning and that when see best practice, we share it.  That is of benefit to the entire school community.<\/p> <p>  Equally importantly, from 2022, we will be giving a commitment that all inspections will have an integral element of the inspection, irrespective of the type of inspection that takes place within a school, that there will be a specific focus on a positive school culture and climate.  This will contemplate anti-bullying measures, etc.  That is an important step forward.  This will now be an aspect of all the evaluations carried out by the inspectorate, beginning with the incidental inspections this week.  It is a commitment.  On the action plan and the anti-bullying procedures, many of the commitments relating to the action plan are cross-departmental in nature.  However, we are committed to honouring them.<\/p> <p>  I have also outlined other measures that are ongoing in our schools.  Extremely positive steps are being taken.  I am conscious that one child or young person experiencing bullying is one too many.  As stated, there is an absolute commitment moving forward in respect of many of the issues I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#D00100","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>When she is reviewing the action plan, I ask the Minister to take into consideration the report that was compiled by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#D00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I want to acknowledge that impressive body of work.

Primary and post-primary school principals and teachers contacted me about that matter when I spoke about the report and they highlighted the importance of emotional and therapeutic supports.  These could be rolled out in some of the schools in order to look at how it would work, best practice, etc.<\/p> <p>  The committee is going to start a body of work on the leaving certificate curriculum.  Has the Minister given any consideration to the inclusion of a mental health and well-being component that could, among other things, help to reduce the incidence and negative impact of bullying?  Could she confirm when she will respond to the National Council and Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, senior cycle review advisory report and make it public?  We would like to have the NCCA before the committee.  However, it will not do so until the report is published and made public.  As Chair of the committee and on behalf of all its members, I ask the Minister to make the report public as soon as possible in order that we can get on with the body of work on leaving certificate reform.<\/p> <p>  Does the Department have any plans to roll-out the FUSE programme nationally?  Budget 2022 is fast approaching.  I have been approached regarding the cut in funding for books for school and, specifically, for school libraries.  A cut to the funding was introduced in 2008 due to the recession and was never restored.  I ask the Minister to look at this matter.  Allocating &euro;10 in respect of every primary schoolgoing child, would be of major assistance in the context of the buying of books.  This would involve using a small part of the Department's budget - a little over &euro;6 million.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to this matter.  I know there will be many requests of her over the coming weeks, but I ask her to look specifically at funding for children's books in school libraries.<\/p> <p>  The Minister can send direct replies to these questions to the clerk.

They are appreciated by me and my wife.  Baby and mammy are doing great altogether.  Thank you very much.<\/p> <p>  I will start off with the Cork Life Centre.  I am encouraged by and welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  I welcome it because it does not seem to suggest, as I feared it would, that everything has been fixed.  Everything is not fixed.  There is a proposal on the table that is welcome.  It is something that could be worked with, but it is not there yet.  I welcome the fact that the Minister clearly acknowledged that.  I encourage her, and all the parties involved in the Cork Life Centre and education and training board, ETB, to continue to engage and try to reach a solution.  I ask the Minister for a commitment to do that: to continue working on this.  In addition, I ask her, if possible to state whether she believes that the staff at the Cork Life Centre needs to be supported and retrained.  There is a lot of experience there.  Perhaps the Minister can give a comment on that.<\/p> <p>  On the return to school, it is welcome that the schools are back.  I commend everyone involved that effort, from parents, teachers, staff to everyone in the Department and the Minister.  However, it is fair to say that in some schools the return has been disrupted, it has been challenging and, to be honest, in some places it has been downright chaotic.  There are two primary reasons for that.  The first is confusion regarding self-isolation, who is supposed to self-isolate and the circumstances relating to close contacts.  We have reports that the criteria are going to change and that this has been as good as agreed by NPHET.  However, there is no real clarity or certainty in that regard.  I have been in contact with principals in my constituency and across the State.  Many of them have raised with me the fact that they feel isolated and that they do not feel that they are getting the support they received last spring.  They feel that it is too hard to get through to the HSE and that they are being asked to do the job of public health themselves.<\/p> <p>  I will come back in just later on this, but I just want to ask the Minister if she has picked up the phone to the HSE.  Has she asked them if they providing the same resources?  I appreciate that there are a number of Departments involved, but this is a cross-governmental issue.  Are they putting in the resources?  Has she gone to the HSE to say that her staff and principals need help and they are not getting it?  That is one question.  The other question is that there is talk that the guidelines are going to change and that asymptomatic close contacts will not have to self-isolate.  What is happening?  Will there be a change on 27 September, or when will it happen?  What will the change be?  What can we anticipate is going to happen in the next few weeks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#D00500","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I will respond in the first instance the question of the Cork Life Centre.

I acknowledge the generous spirit of openness and co-operation displayed in terms of finding a pathway forward.  I acknowledge that this will require ongoing engagement.  It is fair to state, however, that significant progress has been made in the context of funding, co-operation hours and many of the other issues that were brought to our attention by the Cork Life Centre in the first place.

The Minister needs to lean on the HSE to provide more resources.  One area of confusion is that there seems to be a discrepancy between the advice the HSE is providing and the advice contained in the Covid-19 response plan provided by the Department of Education as to when a child should self-isolate and the symptoms involved.  The Department document outlines a number of common symptoms and other uncommon symptoms.  These include runny noses and stuffy noses.  Obviously, these are very common among children.  The document states that if people have any symptoms of Covid-19, they should self-isolate.  The HSE advice, under a heading on when it is okay to send a child to school or childcare, states if children have been told by the HSE they are a close contact, it is usually okay to send them to school or childcare if they only have nasal symptoms such as runny nose or a sneeze.  To be honest, we have had it ourselves and we kept the child at home.  Families will face tens of thousands of situations with runny noses.  Perhaps not tens of thousands, but certainly thousands.  The Department of Education is saying not to send the children in and the HSE is saying that it is okay to do so.  Will the Minister clarify the position?  Some of the confusion is because it is not clear which symptoms require self-isolation and which do not.

I am next on the list of speakers and I have some questions on the same subject matter.  I want to bring this to the attention of the Minister because I have spoken to more than a dozen principals of secondary schools and nine principals of primary schools in the past week.  They have reported a delay in the notification of close contacts.  They are getting the notification from the school through parents, the children themselves or hearsay but the notification of an actual close contact is taking another day.  I fully appreciate that is the duty of the Department of Health and the public health officials to do this.  It was, of course, in the second week back in school and, therefore, many children were circulating at primary and secondary level.  I want to report this to the Minister because it was a point made to me by a number of principals.  They believed it was important to mention.<\/p> <p>  On foot of the conversations I had in recent weeks, I want to report some positive things that came to my attention.  These were unprompted remarks from principals at both levels.  They were pleased with the supports they were given for school cleaning.  Particularly last year, they felt very informed in terms of making decisions on the provision of additional supports, whether administrative, teaching or otherwise.  This was at both levels.  A number of principals, unprompted, suggested this to me.  It is worth mentioning because, as is often the case at these committees as the Minister will understand, we focus on the problems.  I wanted to focus on the positives.<\/p> <p>  I will now pivot to make some remarks.  I thank the Chair for raising the hot school meals programme.  It is a very worthy endeavour by the Department of Social Protection.  I know it is not in the remit of the Minister's Department.  It is important and I would like to see an initiative, particularly when it comes to the infrastructure in certain schools that cannot cater for these measures.  I would be interested to know whether it would be the job of the Department of Education to provide certain schools that may not have them with the funding to build the necessary facilities to provide hot meals.  Would it be supported in some manner through the Department of Social Protection?  This is a really brief question and I would like a really brief answer if the Minister would not mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#E00900","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for relaying the very positive remarks he has received from principals in both sectors.

It states once a child is diagnosed as Covid positive the HSE is automatically informed and is aware of it.  I do appreciate that, as the Deputy has said, that in some instances the school hears it elsewhere.  The HSE has been very clear.  It has stated that removing the child from school it is the first and immediate step that needs to be taken.  It will then make contact with the school directly.

One of the points made to me during my ring-around of schools in September, which I always do, was that we should figure out how the Department could further the committee&rsquo;s ambition to provide pooled support to schools in terms of professionals to endeavour to attend to students who are going through difficult times.

I appreciate the matter does not concern the Department of Education.  However, I ask that the relevant officials from the Departments of Health and Education come together to try to figure out how to improve the supports being offered to children.  The Minister is a constituency Deputy, just like me.  Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan and all the other members will have stories about the lack of support offered by CAMHS and the lack consistency.  When the service is available, it is fantastic, but gaining access to it is a disaster.  That is why the committee made the recommendation on additional emotional and therapeutic supports.  We already recognise that there is a shortfall.  Is it possible for the Minister, when considering the implementation of the recommendation, to talk to the HSE and relevant officials and endeavour to improve the overall supports available to students at both primary and secondary levels?<\/p> <p>  I am way over time.

One of them comprised schoolchildren.<\/p> <p>  Let me repeat a point that the Chairman made.  Schools and principals are very pleased with the supports that have been put in place.  I know that from speaking to them but also from the fact that I have not been communicated with by principals in the constituency complaining about a lack of support.<\/p> <p>  There is some confusion over close contacts.  It might benefit Ministers if there were greater clarity on that issue.  Unvaccinated schoolchildren who are close contacts and who are not displaying any symptoms should remain at school.  They should go to school.  We need to take into account that there are great benefits from having 92% of the population vaccinated.  One benefit is such that we have to start prioritising and re-emphasising the importance of in-person school attendance.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister on CLASS, which I welcome wholeheartedly.  Does she believe the scheme will ensure that children whose education was disrupted by not being at in-person school classes will not fall through the cracks, and that those who have fallen through the cracks will be able to lift them back out of it and into school learning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#F00700","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I appreciate his opening remarks.  On CLASS, this is the third aspect of the support programme for children, as we have said previously.  The important aspect of the CLASS initiative is that it is for the benefit of all students.  There will be targeted teaching hours made available to schools.  For example, a post-primary school of 800 pupils will be entitled to an additional 1,100 hours, which is 51 weeks.  That amounts to a full year and a half of additional resources from a teaching point of view.  A primary school of 200 pupils will be eligible for 15 weeks.<\/p> <p>  The important consideration is that what is being offered is twofold.  In the first instance, the scheme will be for any student in any of the platforms that have lost out in terms of academic work or otherwise.  Schools have the autonomy to decide upon that.  The second aspect is that the scheme gives young people an opportunity to socialise, engage and team-build, and basically to have fun also.  We are examining other creative measures, including sport, drama, poetry and artistic endeavours.  They could very much be features of the programme in our schools also.  Each school has the autonomy to decide how best to break up the hours.<\/p><p>Whether it would be for team-teaching purposes, group teaching or individual teaching from an academic learning point of view or for the recreation and creative aspect, it is a two-pronged attack.  It is acknowledging that students, when they are not in school and where they were not in school as a consequence of Covid, are now deserving of support and CLASS, from the middle of October, will be in a position to meet that.  That is in conjunction with the other two aspects, which were they supplementary programme and the enhance summer provision which, this year, for the first time ever also, was open to all schools to apply.

It is a precursor to advising schools that, when we look towards 2022, all the variety of types of inspections will focus on the general climate and school culture.  That is the best way to phrase the matter because it is about school culture, atmosphere and positivity.  An integral part of that will be how issues of bullying are dealt with within the school.<\/p> <p>  Equally, as the Deputy stated, the school community charter, as I would hope there will be agreement to rename it now, makes provision for a buy-in from all of the stakeholders - parents, students, staff and everyone within the school community.

What I know so far is that approximately 34,000 children participated in summer provision, which is a big increase on last year.  Some of those forms are still coming in from parents.  In the context of the Covid pandemic in particular and the risk of regression that we spoke about earlier, it provided much needed service to children with additional needs.  It was also expanded this year so that there was from two weeks up to five in some instances.  It was at the discretion of each school.<\/p> <p>  In terms of payment, participating schools should be paid in early course.  If the Deputy had a particular experience with a school that has not been, he might let me know.  We endeavour to pay as quickly as possible.  In some instances, it can be difficult to do that.

Something that would be worth emphasising, from the Minister's point of view, would be the potential to allow experienced teachers to be the ones who step out and bring the substitute teachers into the classroom because, almost by definition, these will be the cohorts that are difficult to reach.  Similar to summer provision, the concern that is coming back to me from principals is whether the substitute cover will be available in order for schools to be able to avail of CLASS.

There is now a mechanism for them to come back into the system, and for job-sharers to increase their hours.<\/p><p> As a consequence of engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, provision is being made over a three-year period from last year to ensure that there will be no negative impact on retired staff in the context of their coming back.

I would like to see costings and a pilot programme in terms of those recommendations around psychologists located within schools for emotional counselling and therapeutic supports.

If any of the principals who have been in contact with are watching these deliberations, they will be pulling their hair out.  Frankly, the return to school was a positive for many schools but there were individual school principals who had never contacted local representatives before in their lives but were forced to do so because of what they termed the shambles that they were dealing with earlier this month.  I concede that not much of the responsibility fell at the doors of the Minister or the Minister of State.  What happened was due to inaction on the part of the HSE and the inability of the public health teams to make timely interventions with schools.  However, there were principals in contact with me who had no option other than to send home entire classes because three, four or five days passed without them hearing from the public health team.<\/p><p>One school of which I am aware has 24 classes and only three CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors.  In addition, we did not get the situation on pregnant teachers sorted in time.  We have the catch-up scheme which has been described as completely inadequate by Judith Harford and Brian Fleming in <i>The Irish Times.  <\/i>The scheme does not compare in any way favourably with similar schemes throughout Europe.  To return to what has been said previously about literacy camps, I have been contacted by two DEIS schools which indicated that are still waiting to be paid.<\/p><p>This sort of nothing-to-see-here attitude from Government is going to have to be checked because this level of complacency is part of the problem.  I would suggest that none of us in Opposition parties have ramped up anxiety or tried to play to a gallery in trying to make people feel as though schools are unsafe.  We have been trying to do the right thing.  I would also suggest however that if the Government is not hearing what we are hearing, then maybe it is not listening as we are.  We can only reflect back what is being said to us.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to ask again about the interaction between the Department and NPHET.  Regulations relating to pregnant teachers changed.  Regardless of whether that was completely coincidental because the matter was in the public arena or not, they did change.  I would be interested in the Minister's reaction particularly to the situation relating to CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors and to the time gap which is leading principals being placed in completely impossible situations in some circumstances whereby they can nothing other than deal with problems relating to Covid and individual Covid cases.<\/p><p>When is the citizens' assembly on education going to be established?  We speak of anti-bullying, but we still have a situation where 90% of our schools are under the patronage of an institution that thinks homosexual acts are acts of grave depravity.  Yet, we are supposed to be serious about tackling homophobic and transgender bullying in schools.  I would think that the citizens' assembly on education should tackle that issue.<\/p><p>I also wish to ask about the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  Almost 12 months have elapsed since I brought an amendment to the House in order to delete the ridiculous provision within that Bill, which was put in at the behest of the private fee-paying school sector, to give schools the opportunity to have 25% of their enrolments set aside for children and grandchildren of past pupils.  The Minister said at the time of the introduction of my amendment to delete that provision, that she would come back within 12 months.  Those 12 months will be up in the first week of November.  What work has been done on that?<\/p><p> As I have the Minister's attention, there is a second level Gaelscoil in my constituency - Gaelchol&aacute;iste Reachrann - that really needs her urgent attention.  I have written to the Minister and the Taoiseach about this matter and I raised the matter with the T&aacute;naiste last week.  I believe the Minister is familiar with the school, which is Donaghmede, Dublin 13.

There is nothing complacent about our return to school.  As I have said, we have consistently engaged right throughout the summer and put funding in place of &euro;57 million alone for this first term for the return to school.  There is no sense of complacency and, in contrast, there is a sense that a high priority is being put on everything we deliver in the education sector.<\/p> <p>  I accept there will always be issues such as glitches and pinch points.  I acknowledge the Deputy's graciousness in saying the pinch points did not fall within our remit but where there was an issue, the HSE came on board to provide additional resources.  It would be unfair to classify our approach as complacent and, if anything, it is a matter of high priority with absolute determination to provide the additional resources and everything else needed for our schools.<\/p> <p>  It is not just the class programme.

At this stage, I suppose, many queries have already been answered.  I will ask the Minister about flexibility in terms of school numbers.  I can give a case in point around a DEIS school in Fahy in Westport.  They have seen numbers increase immensely in the past few years and the school currently has 114 pupils on the roll.  That will guarantee the school the appointment of a new teacher next year.  However, there has been an unexpected large number of new entrants this year, with the result that it now has 36 pupils in junior and senior infants, with 31 pupils in first and second class.  We are still in the midst of a pandemic and trying to make schools as safe as possible.  I ask, therefore, that such cases could be looked at to see if we can address those positions of having 36 pupils or 31 pupils in the same classrooms, with teachers trying to manage them.  Some flexibility around that would be really good.<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome the statement around the additional administrative leave days for principals.  How are the decisions made around that to provide for substitution arrangements?  How is it decided?<\/p> <p>  We clearly need more teachers to meet the demand we have but we have seen that the CAO points for primary teaching are now as high as 522, largely because of the cap on undergraduate places.  The reason given previously for this cap was to control supply but what happens in reality if students are pushed to the master's degree courses that are predominantly in one very expensive private college that now trains approximately half the teachers?  I will ask the committee to look at this but when will the Minister sign off on the intake figures for the 2022-23 academic year?  I know this is something that certainly needs changing.  I have a number of other questions but I realise I have very limited time.

I was taking part in an important debate on bullying and harassment in third level institutions in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  I commend all of the work that has been done throughout the country to get schools open, which was a significant and important priority for the Minister.  There was a level of unprecedented funding devoted to getting the schools open.   There are always going to be difficulties and challenges that arise and we are never sure they are going to be challenges until they do arise.  As they crop up, it is important that they are dealt with quickly and decisively.  One comment that a principal made to me was on the possible use of a living document that could be changed and adapted in the context of dealing with the pandemic, as opposed to circulars coming out all the time.  Such a development might work very well.<\/p> <p>  I got to hear some of the debate on the Cork Life Centre and I was very interested in the work that it did previously.  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to find a solution now.  There has to be scope for similar types of education programmes around the country.  Are there any plans for that?<\/p> <p>  The report on school bullying - as the Minister will be aware the committee held eight different sessions to discuss that subject - is a extremely important.  When people&rsquo;s lives are being impacted very negatively, with, at times, long-term consequences, it was very important area that we made a large number of recommendations, namely, 25.  I had the opportunity to read the part of the Minister&rsquo;s opening statement in which comment was made on some of the recommendations.  The making available of emotional counselling and the therapeutic supports for every school is a key recommendation we made.  Is there something in this that could be delivered?<\/p> <p>  As an aside, there was a very sad situation in a school in my area last week whereby a young girl in sixth class died from cancer only two weeks after she was diagnosed.  I spoke to the class teacher last week who informed me that NEPS was fantastic and that it helped in a very significant way.  This was her first, and hopefully her last, time to ever have to experience something like this within a class.  She thought the service was excellent and I felt it was important to make a note of that and of how we support our young people through what life throws at them.  To have those emotional and therapeutic supports available would be very good.<\/p> <p>  I also want to ask about the possibility of the FUSE programme being rolled out and about the Roots of Empathy programme from Barnardos?  As we are talking about bullying and promoting positive mental health, this is very important.

Can the Minister also talk to us a little bit about those programmes as well, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#K00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and acknowledge the various points she has raised.  There has been significant progress on the Cork Life Centre and I acknowledge the work of the officials of the Department, the Cork Education and Training Board and the Cork Life Centre, which has engaged so positively and proactively in being able to progress matters.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator&rsquo;s specific question on other types of schools and moving forward in the provision of same, the out-of-school provision report is nearing completion.  It is significant that this is the first time ever that there has been an acknowledgement of education centres of this type and of out-of-school provision.  That must be looked at with a recognition that not one type of schooling suits every child, which I fully accept.  The report, which will inform our thinking into the future, will involve close engagement across the education sector.  That engagement will include students and tutors who are currently involved in provision such as those in the Cork Life Centre.  When we have that comprehensive body of work done, it will inform opportunities going forward.<\/p> <p>  On emotional counselling, I thank the Senator for her comments.  Ms Tansey from NEPS is here with me.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the very positive commentary in respect of NEPS.  Since becoming Minister, I have been very conscious of the importance of well-being within our schools.  I reiterate what I said earlier on that.  There is excellent work going on in our schools in the context of well-being and even in respect of the return to and reopening of schools.  A very definite well-being approach was taken to welcoming back students, staff, school communities, etc.  There is always a need for additional support, however.  It was for this reason I ensured that, in the context of budget 2021, we would have 120 additional guidance counsellors and 17 NEPS positions made available to support the work to which the Senator alluded.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to therapeutic counselling.  That is generally provided within the community and may not necessarily fall within my Department's remit.  I acknowledge, however, that there is significant cross-departmental work going on between the Departments of Health and Education.  The work of the Department of Health is rooted in the community but, as I said earlier, I am currently working with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to look at an how we might be able to support each other and to support, most importantly, our students and school communities.  I am hoping in the not too distant future to be in a position to come back with something that has been worked through with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who has responsibility for mental health and well-being, her Department and the Department of Education.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the significant well-being supports that are available in our schools.  We are now rolling out extensive CPD support for schools.  Equally, there will be a platform available to schools with all of the well-being resources being made available.

I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State and the staff members who are in attendance today.<\/p> <p>  I commend both Ministers, in the first instance, on their work.  I have been pleasantly surprised by some of the alternative ways of thinking on display.  The Minister spoke quite eloquently in acknowledging the work of Cork Life Centre, the management of which, on the basis of the contact I had with them previously, were probably quite frustrated.  She also referred to acknowledging that not all children learn in the same way and that we need to look at different ways of educating young people.<\/p> <p>  The work that our committee did in preparing its report on bullying shows that children have different experiences of school and that identity very much comes into it when people are bullied.<\/p><p>That is evidenced by much of the research referenced in the report.  So many witnesses came before us to discuss the issue.  There were common themes.  We absolutely have to consider therapeutic services, but also the reasons for the experiences children are having.  Some really interesting things came out of that.  I know the Minister has read the report, and I thank her for that.  What kind of funding can be put in place in this regard?  What came out loud and clear is that teaching staff need support in implementing some of the suggestions and recommendations we put forward.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  We did some training that involved acknowledging our own biases.  That is an important part of the work of teaching staff as well when it comes to identity because, as we have to acknowledge, there is not significant diversity among such staff.  We have excellent teachers but we need training across the board to ensure that everybody is acknowledging where they come from in society and how to interact with people from diverse backgrounds.<\/p><p> I had to leave the meeting earlier because I had Internet access problems.  However, I heard the Minister say that she was considering changes to the student and parent charter.  I very much welcome  that.  Even a renaming of the charter would be an acknowledgement that schools are communities made up of students, parents and teachers, but also the wider community.  Would she consider putting in amendments relating to guidelines on arrangements to be made by schools for those who may not wish to take religious instruction, for instance?  I know it is referenced in existing legislation but, in the context of the guidelines themselves, schools are implementing things differently.  It is an important part of the overall picture.  It may be worth considering a survey of parents to see what it is they are expecting and whether they want religious training or religious instruction for their children rather than having to opt out.  Opting out can be a cause of bullying, in and of itself, which goes back to the point on identity.  Those are a couple of specific issues relating to funding and religious instruction.<\/p><p> The Minister will be aware that I am a former chair of Home Education Network Ireland and have been in touch with many families that take their children out of school because of trauma.  It is important to recognise that.  Some families do so for ideological reasons but there are many people who do it because of school trauma.  As such, the work the Minister is doing in respect of other kinds of provision is really important to address that issue and ensure it is a matter of choice.  It also means that people have the choice to have an education in school where appropriate and not feel traumatised by it.  I welcome that and I really look forward to hearing more on the subject.<\/p><p> A significant point relating to children going back to school is that many of them do not have access to lockers.  It may seem like a small issue but it is actually quite a major one for my children, who have been in school since I became a Senator, in the context of carrying heavy schoolbags.  Some schools seem to be providing lockers.  Are there specific guidelines in that regard?  Having to carry a heavy schoolbag means children do not cycle or walk and that more of them travel to school in cars, which also has a climate impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#K01000","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I appreciate the points she has made.  I will start with her final point.  As regards lockers, I am very familiar with how that works and I absolutely appreciate how students and families are being discommoded in that respect.  This was done in the context of Covid to ensure there was a minimisation of students circulating within schools and moving from classrooms to lockers to change books and so on.  Obviously, as we move beyond the Covid environment, everything will be considered and reviewed.  However, we are very conscious that, this year, we retained all of the infection mitigation, prevention and control measures that were in existence last year, as well as the best practice advice that was given to us in terms of operation within our schools.  Notwithstanding what may be happening in wider society, it has been a particularly important element of safety within schools that we have had relatively stringent infection prevention and control measures and guidance of that nature.  It has very much worked in our favour.  However, I absolutely take the point made by the Senator regarding parents and students and so on.  I hope that we are moving in a more positive direction.  Everything will be kept under review as we move forward.<\/p> <p>  As regards the school community charter, I am keen to progress it.  This will be coming to committee, including amendments to rename the charter.  At the core of this matter is that we seek to operate within a community in schools.  For that reason, I am proposing that it will be known as the school community charter.  Obviously, there will be opportunities for further discussion, debate and engagement on a variety of issues, including those raised by the Senator, at the committee and elsewhere.  I am keen to facilitate the widest debate, discussion and engagement on it and I will welcome that.  The richness of the discussion will be enhanced by more engagement from the widest cohort of people.  I look forward to that.<\/p> <p>  As regards well-being and measures of that nature within schools, I referenced earlier the very strong well-being approach being taken within schools.  This year, we will have a national roll-out of CPD in terms of implementation of the well-being policy from the Department.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, will be responsible for that and for supporting schools.  I am clear that well-being in school is not the preserve of one individual; it must be shared.  I know from experience that it is shared across all the school community and staff.  It is not just the job of guidance counsellors; it is very much at the heart and the core of the role of language teachers or science teachers, while in primary schools it is very much at the core of the role of teachers, special needs assistants and school management.  Across all primary and secondary schools, everybody is invested in well-being.  I acknowledge that.  There will be a significant roll-out of training support.<\/p> <p>  As already stated, specific provision was made in budget 2021 for an additional 120 guidance counsellors and an 17 NEPS psychologists.  I am very conscious that, from the point of view of the Department of Health, many of the resources are within the community.  I am currently working with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to consider a joint approach through which there may be an opportunity for us to look at measures we might be able to work on within the school format, acknowledging the excellent interdepartmental co-operation between the Departments of Education and Health.  That has always been the case and we continue to develop and grow that co-ordination.  There is an opportunity with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her specific portfolio in terms of well-being and mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#L00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Senator O'Reilly was the final contributor.

That is &euro;50 million for additional teaching supports.  I apologise, as the Minister or Minister of State may have already commented on some of the matters about which I am going to ask.  The Minister mentioned that the supports are dependent on the size of the school involved.  I come from a rural area and some of our primary schools are smaller.  We have some large schools as well, but we should be conscious that those supports are evenly distributed and that account is taken of the size of and numbers in the relevant school.

I thank the Acting Chair for the latitude and time he has afforded me.  I know that he and the Chairman raised this matter earlier.  The Minister may have replied to their questions already.  Is there a system within the Department of Education for reviewing and approving certain schools?  I am looking at this matter specifically in the context of DEIS.  For example, DEIS band 1 schools can access hot school meals.  In order to increase the number of DEIS schools, however, I understand that the position has to be reviewed.  I am aware that a more general policy for schools is under consideration but I am interested in discovering how we will be identifying schools in need.  Many schools have been in need in the past year or two.  We should have follow-on supports at post-primary level for students who attended DEIS band 1 schools.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for her assistance regarding the provision of additional accommodation in my area.  St. Teresa's Special School has been approved for additional accommodation.  I do not know if Mr. Hubert Loftus is still with us, but I would like to know if there is a timeline in respect of capital infrastructure provision.  I understand that we have taken measures to accelerate it as much as possible.  Also on capital infrastructure, we have spoken about the Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa project many times.  The project relating to the school has been in train for 25 years, which is a long time, and remains at stage 2b.  A great deal of work has been done by the planning team, the Department and the school on moving this project beyond stage 2b and to get an application for planning submitted to Galway County Council.  Perhaps Mr. Loftus or someone else might be able to provide an update.  If not, I would really appreciate it if a written update could be provided.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister and Minister for State for what they have achieved in the past year in the context of children with special needs and inclusion.  I also sit on the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health.  The Minister mentioned mental health supports for children in primary and post-primary schools.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, was mentioned.  She is crucial to this because she has responsibility for the area of mental health.  With regard the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who is responsible for public health, the healthy counties initiative being rolled out through the local authorities might also be something to support, with an integrated roll-out in our schools and local communities in order to have as much an impact as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021092100002#M00700","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I acknowledge and appreciate the Senator's remarks on CLASS.  I come from a rural constituency.  I am an enormous fan of the smaller rural schools, as I am of all schools, but I appreciate the widest experience of education, which is in the smaller and larger schools.  We were very clear in the manner in which we laid out the supports for the schools that it would be weighted in terms of the size.  Obviously, the resources required by a smaller school would be less than those required by a larger school.  Notwithstanding that, those resources are being made available.  In addition, other initiatives such as BLAST, which brings live arts into the schools, is available to all schools irrespective of size.  That also fits in very nicely with the CLASS Covid learning supports programme.  The enormous issue for us is that we are very keen there would be an emphasis on teaching and learning in this programme, from an academic point of view, but also the widest experience of socialisation, integration, resilience and team-building.  That is why we are also looking at making sport, creativity, drama, poetry, or whatever it might be available in schools.  Each school has the autonomy to identify it for itself.<\/p> <p>  The DEIS model, as Senator Dolan is aware, is being examined with a view to developing a new statistics-based model that will identify schools that are most in need.  The detailed quality analysis has been completed by the DEIS technical group and the Department is now engaging with the education partners.  The work needs to transact, but it is ongoing.  Hot school meals come within the remit of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  I acknowledge the positive manner in which she engages with the Department of Education on that.

I am the chief officer for Cork Kerry community healthcare.  I thank members for the invitation to meet with the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health to discuss Owenacurra centre in Midleton, County Cork.  I am joined by my colleagues: Mr. Derek Chambers, general manager of mental health operations in the HSE; and, here in the room with me, Dr. Sinead O&rsquo;Brien, executive clinical director, Cork mental health services, and consultant psychiatrist.<\/p> <p>  The Owenacurra centre is a mental health services continuing care unit in Midleton, County Cork.  It is registered with the Mental Health Commission to provide a service for 24 people for psychiatry of later life, continuing mental health care and mental health rehabilitation.  There are currently 19 people resident in the centre.  Mindful of the fact that the current building and layout do not allow for the needs of a modern residential and day service, our mental health services planned for a refurbishment of the centre.  We are very aware of the excellent work carried out by the team at the Owenacurra centre and the special place it occupies in Midleton town centre.  Our aim was to bring the building to a standard where it matched the care being provided there.  We were also acutely aware that the current building simply did not allow for the kind of care and recovery which a modern service should provide.  Unfortunately, as we moved to the advanced planning phase for the centre, serious concerns emerged that any level of refurbishment could not bring the building to the standards required.  Advice from construction experts has led the HSE to take the difficult but necessary decision to close the centre.  We have reviewed all options for the centre and every option involves a complete demolition of the existing building, rather than a phased refurbishment.<\/p> <p>  While we were aware of the pressing need to bring the building to the standard which residents deserve, it was only when the fabric of the building was assessed for this work that we established that they only way to refurbish the building was to knock it.  This was not our original plan for the valuable service at the Owenacurra centre, and while it was a difficult decision, there was no other option open to us.<\/p><p> Although there were no conditions attached to the registration or escalation or enforcement actions since the previous inspection in 2020, the Mental Health Commission completed an inspection between 16 and 19 February of this year, raising serious concerns with regard to persistent non-compliance with regulation 22, which relates to premises.  On foot of this, Cork Kerry community healthcare committed to providing plans for the Owenacurra centre to work to address the non-compliance.  These concerns echoed the ongoing concerns of local management about the condition and unsuitability of the current building to serve the needs of the people using the service.<\/p><p> On 23 June of this year, the HSE informed the Mental Health Commission that we would close the centre on a phased basis by the end of October 2021.  On 28 June, the acting head of service in mental health wrote to the staff, residents, families and carers at Owenacurra centre to apprise them of the issues arising about the condition of the building.  Local Oireachtas Members and health forum members were also informed at that time.<\/p><p> The immediate priority is the welfare of the 19 residents of the centre.  We are working with each resident and their families individually to agree an appropriate alternative placement based on their assessed needs.  Residents will move on a phased basis after detailed consultation and discussion.  They will transfer to the most appropriate setting that will meet their needs, and with their expressed preference to the forefront in any such decision.  Assessments with residents have been completed and consultation with families is under way at present.<\/p><p> The site will be reviewed by Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation to confirm what healthcare services are required in the area so as to maximize the use of the site to the benefit of the local public.  A mental health day service is also located within the building.  Services in the day centre have been affected due to Covid.  Work is under way to identify an alternative location for this service, as close as possible to the current location and to recommence this service as soon as possible.<\/p><p> An implementation team has been tasked to manage the closure of the Owenacurra centre within the timeframe indicated.  An initial step in the process was for the mental health multidisciplinary team in the area to formally assess the needs of each of the residents.  All of the assessments have been completed at this stage.  A full Camberwell assessment of need has been completed with each resident and an action plan has been developed, following on from the assessment.  The team has been asked to use the housing preference and assessment survey assessment tool, developed by Cowman, Gough and Cunningham, or a similar tool for all residents prior to a decision being made on their place of transfer.<\/p><p> The multidisciplinary team within the Owenacurra centre continues to have ongoing discussions with all residents to offer ongoing support and assurances.  In order to keep residents and families informed throughout the process, a key contact lead is available to support and act as a facilitator between residents, their families and the project team.  Social work input has been increased to support residents and families through this period.  Social work also has support from the housing co-ordinator to assist with any third-party agency interactions which may be required to assist residents in moving to new homes.  There is increased consultant input from the clinical director to assist with the transfer of residents of the Owenacurra centre.  A member from the independent Irish Advocacy Network is part of the project steering group, in addition to a mental health service user family member and carer engagement representative, to ensure the residents and families continue to have independent supports available throughout the process.<\/p><p> The closure of any centre, particularly one that provides residential care to service users, can cause concern and uncertainty for residents and families.  We understand that the Owenacurra centre has provided a very valuable service to residents, in a unique location, for many years.  The HSE is committed to working closely with the residents to find appropriate alternatives as close to Midleton as possible over the coming period.  We are committed to making sure that residents have the same level of links to their community and loved ones in their new homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021092100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzgerald.

I want to cover a couple of areas, starting with the building itself.  Most of us have read the building report in detail and we can recognise the significant work that would have to be undertaken.  I want to take a moment to understand the timeline of this process and how we got here.  The first report in this inspection process was in 2016 when 14 areas of non-compliance were recorded.  The premises was considered non-compliant with regulation 22, which is what we are discussing today.  There was a moderate level of non-compliance.  By the way, the rates of compliance and risk rating seem to change every year, which is not great in terms of trying to follow inspection reports.  In 2016, the non-compliance was rated as moderate.  We will not go through all the reports.  The 2016 report referred to a lack of communal space, three-person rooms not being of a suitable size and the use of keys.  The report stated it required improvement.  It was also pointed out that there was no maintenance budget in the centre.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, the premises was considered compliant with regulation 22.  The report states the quality rating was satisfactory, the building was in a good state of repair internally and externally and there was ample personal space.  In 2018, the building was considered non-compliant again, with moderate non-compliance.  That report stated the building was not in a good state of repair internally or externally.  A change in external bad repair over a year is unusual, speaking from a professional point of view.  Buildings degrade over a long period and, therefore, this is interesting.  What seems to come up in a number of reports is that the toilets and bathrooms were not in good repair.  In 2019, the building was back to being non-compliant with regulation 21 but the risk rating was considered low.  There was a requirement for significant renovations.  Some of these renovations have been done.  The toilets and bathrooms were considered to be clean, hygienic and in good repair.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions about this timeline.  In 2019, the report stated significant renovations were undertaken.

I suppose in reality the building itself, and it is important that I outline this, was not necessarily coming up in lights, for want of a better phrase, in terms of having significant issues.

The Deputy earlier referenced those reports, that really centred on the prevalence of asbestos and fire-related issues.

There has been an ongoing issue with privacy and dignity.  This is a design issue with the building.  The building has been there since the early 1970s.  We are speaking about a building that was of its time 50 years ago.  Any renovation we try to do, whether a new build or refurbishment, is done to bring a building up to a standard at which we are protecting people's privacy and dignity, creating adequate space for circulation and privacy and creating a modern build.

Deputy Hourigan went through the detail of the inspection reports.  The communication in this respect could be improved.  There should have been a better way to engage with the residents and their families.  I understand from Mr. Fitzgerald's note that they were informed in June and that the timeline is the end of October.  Has proper follow-on accommodation been sourced for those 19 residents?  What were the initial thoughts of the teams in the HSE in that regard?  Was it residential care?  I am not aware of the level of need of these residents.  Will the current accommodation that has been proposed meet the requirements of the families involved and their loved ones?  Will Mr. Fitzgerald or Mr. Ryan, if he is available, comment on the communication involved?

I welcome Mr. Fitzgerald, Dr. O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. Chambers.  I will get straight to the point.  The previous speakers covered much of the nitty gritty and the aesthetics of what we have been discussing, that is, the building.  I listened to Mr. Fitzgerald's comments and the word \"building\" has been mentioned many times.<\/p><p>I am worried that this was flagged up in reports as far back as 2016.  From listening to service users and families of the service users, they feel the patients have got a hard deal.  One can put in all the fancy words about conditions, registration, escalation, enforcement of actions and bla bla bla but it comes down to the fact that the HSE has the responsibility to provide a service.  If the HSE is not maintaining a building in good nick, it should not let that fall on the patients because they are suffering.  The best example I can give is that if one brings one's car to get the national car test, NCT, and it fails the test, one will get a report.  That car will not pass the test until those problems are fixed so I want to know why those problems were not acted on previously.<br\/><br\/>Dr. O'Brien mentioned assessments.  When were these full assessments carried out?  Is it true that some of the patients were so upset that they were uncontrollably crying?  I also want to go back to what was mentioned about filling posts and temporary posts.  I have seen posts being advertised for 13 years and lying idle.  Those are not proper answers to our questions.  One matter that really disgusts me, and I will be frank about it, is the matter of looking for appropriate accommodation for these people.  They are not patients but  are people and they have feelings.  The appropriate place for this is Midleton in County Cork.  One can go back over all the Sl&aacute;intecare and A Vision for Change reports.  They were about community integration and supports and we have that.  We had a Covid case in that centre but there has never been a suicide.  I have been in there and I have met the patients.  I know the staff in there and the HSE has not been kind to them when it comes to communication.  What is the alternative to losing those services?  I was taken by page 4 of the Owenacurra briefing document on the future of the site.  I have put in parliamentary questions over and over again and the generic answer has been:<\/p><blockquote>\tAs this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.  However, members of the Oireachtas are advised that the HSE is currently unable to access the information to answer Parliamentary Questions... <\/blockquote><p>This is going back to July.  I resubmitted the question and now the generic reply states that it has been passed on through the Minister's office to the HSE for reply.  That will take at least another two weeks.  Communication has been poor for us and it has been atrocious for the families from what I have heard.  On top of that, the document on the future of the site states: &quot;The site will be reviewed with Cork Kerry Community Healthcare Organisation to confirm what healthcare services are required in the area&quot;.  It then goes on to question whether the site is suitable for the delivery of any of these services.  That is a very worrying line.<br\/><br\/>The HSE does not understand the importance of a community-led and integrated centre.  There are many locals from Midleton, where I am from, in the centre but it also covers a massive hinterland.  The HSE is going to move them to what it calls a suitable place.  It cannot be suitable if the areas they have mentioned are not accessible by public transport.  Some of them are out in the country and others are locked out for 12 hours per day.  That is not the integration of people.  We need to come up with a plan B because the HSE does not even have a plan A for the centre, the site, the day care services or for all of these patients.<br\/><br\/>We ask all of these questions but there is no answer to them because the HSE does not have the answers.  I will tell the witnesses how serious it is.  We were at a full public meeting last night and there was anger there.  I am asking the HSE to reverse this and come up with an alternative project because this is not going away in east Cork.  The people out there are angry and worried.  The witnesses may not be aware of this but unfortunately we had a tag in our town going back to 2002 when it was known as the suicide capital of the world but the witnesses are telling me we do not need mental health services in this town or in east Cork.  It is a farce that the HSE came up with this report and is using it as an excuse.  It is also using the Mental Health Commission as an excuse and it is blaming it on it.  The Mental Health Commission was designed to keep tabs on the HSE, keep it going and do things right.<\/p><p>There is a Midleton community book and the proceeds of that go to the Midleton Community Hospital.  It is led and supported by the community.  That is how important these things are to the town.  I do not mean to be harsh, but I have to be honest with the witnesses.<\/p><p> References was made to when those full assessments were completed.  It was also suggested to me via email by a number of worried constituents and family members, in the early stages around seven weeks ago, that some of the patients were coerced into signing stuff, including relocation forms.  I do not know how true that is.  Do the witnesses know anything about that?<\/p><p> In Midleton and east Cork, we need to respect and humanise this.  The building is archaic and it may not be fit for purpose, but the services in that town, which serve all of east Cork, are fit for purpose.  I noticed a poster put by a patient in my town last Saturday and it resonated with me.  The poster stated, \"Improve us not move us\".  I would appreciate it if the witnesses could answer my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021092100002#F00800","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>The Deputy is voicing a concern about services and the removal of services in the area, which is a reasonable thing to put to us.

It is our full intention to continue to do so.  It is also important to say that we did not set out to close Owenacurra.  The reality is that the building is not suitable for the purpose it serves now or would serve into the immediate future.  That is a problem that is not easily fixed and that is an important issue.  I know I have said it before but I have to keep coming back to this point.  Some people are moving through those services and into more independent living where that is possible.

The situation comes down to that.  I am sorry for cutting across Dr. O&rsquo;Brien.<\/p> <p>  My other point concerns Mr. Fitzgerald referring to building and independent living in that context.

It is also much appreciated.<\/p> <p>  Last night, I attended a meeting at the Midleton Park Hotel convened to discuss the situation at the Owenacurra centre.  I acknowledge the phenomenal work undertaken in the background by our community in east Cork in response to the closure of this facility.  The Owenacurra centre has done phenomenal work with the service users in the area and with our community in recent decades.  We heard that last night from members of the families whose loved ones had been using the service in the years since the facility opened and also from some of the people who themselves had used the services.  I commend the wonderful work that the HSE staff have done on the ground in the community and what people in Midleton have done to offer support to those who have used the Owenacurra centre since it opened.  Some of the information which came to light at that meeting last night was concerning in the context of the decision to close this facility.  I was even more concerned to hear what the head of the Mental Health Commission had to say yesterday on the \"Drivetime\" programme about the HSE&rsquo;s decision in this regard, because I had assumed that the commission would have been working in tandem with the HSE to a degree.  I will seek a comment from Mr. Fitzgerald on that aspect later.<\/p> <p>  Many questions will be asked about this situation as we debate the topic.  An important question to ask first, however, is whether there is any possibility, despite reports about the building being in bad condition, of residential services being maintained in the building.  I refer to those services being maintained not just for people in the Midleton area but for those people who come from all over my constituency and beyond to avail of the service at the Owenacurra centre.  The loss of the residential aspect of the services being provided is extremely concerning.  I find it hard to comprehend how moving the residential patients around the county, which is what has been described to me as a public representative, is going to be in the best interests of their health and care.  I open with that question.  I apologise in advance to Mr. Fitzgerald because I will be interrupting him, depending on the time we have left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021092100002#J00600","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>As I outlined, the reality of the situation is that we are not in a position to renovate that building, even on a phased basis.

I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for that answer.  A suggestion made last night was quite a palatable one for the people involved.  Everyone to whom I have spoken told me that they would like to see this service being retained in the Midleton area and that some alternative location for the provision of the residential services would be found there.  That, in turn, would allow the HSE the time to go in and do whatever needs to be done in the Owenacurra Centre building.  It might mean levelling and rebuilding it to provide a new service which would be fit for purpose.  I am aware that there are significant concerns regarding the current building.

Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned what was in the best interests of the service users.  I do not agree, however, with the move that has been made to relocate people to different centres.  There is a great degree of confusion in this regard.  I accept that there must be dialogue between service users and their families regarding whether they consent to allowing them to be aware of the information about where they might potentially be moved to.  I am concerned though by the degree of confusion I heard expressed by family members last night at the meeting in the Midleton Park Hotel.

Is Mr. Fitzgerald aware of whether the Mental Health Commission has visited St. Stephen's Hospital?  In terms of where I am coming from on this, Cois Alla in Kanturk covers a geographical area, Solas Nua covers Mallow, the Carrigabrick service covers Fermoy and the Carrigmore service covers Cork.  What the HSE is doing in closing Owenacurra centre is to de facto take out a massive geographical area in terms of residential capability, including respite and short-term capability.  That is the message that is being sent to the families.  As a committee, we have to speak for the families.  The witnesses may argue that we are being rhetorical in doing so, but we empathise and sympathise with the families on the basis that we share their concerns and fears that this process, which started in June and is to be a four-month process, is too short.  Not enough time or consideration has been given to all of the factors involved such that every person can be happy that whatever transition he or she makes will be safe for him or her, but that if there are any question marks over the process, a break will be put on it.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister should intervene directly on this issue.  At this stage, we have all been in contact with him about this.  There needs to be pause for thought and reflection about whether we are sending residents who have made huge progress from a therapeutic point of view backwards instead of forwards into life.  We should not be providing services in a setting that is further away from where they live and where their families are.  Do the witnesses understand those fears?  They are legitimate fears on the part of people and we are trying to reflect them to the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  I refer again to the services in Kanturk, Mallow, Fermoy and Carrigmore.  They are set within the towns and they are fit for purpose, although I accept there are issues with them from time to time in terms of meeting the full panoply of regulations.  I am not convinced.<\/p><p>We have heard here from every single member across the political divide that there needs to be some pause for reflection on this.  Quite frankly, the witnesses have not fully articulated the issue of the cost of replacement.  They state that they have produced an internal report.  However, it is unconscionable that the HSE should come to this committee without anticipating a question from one or all members as to how much would it cost to do the repairs and refurbishment, as well as on the cost of a replacement building on that site.  The HSE has significant capital resources to do that.  We do not want a situation following this decision whereby people in the east Cork region who need access to mental health services will be left bereft.  I ask that the HSE pauses and reflects on this decision.  They have given four months' notice.  If you are kicking a dog out of the kennel, you would give him more notice than you have given some of these people to be out of their home.  I am sorry if I sound exercised about this issue but I feel strongly about it.  A pause needs to be put on this in the public interest and in order that we as public representatives have more time to interrogate line by line everything that you are doing here.  Then we can fully and with good conscience represent constituents for whom we are deeply concerned on this matter.  I apologise that I have used up most of my time, Chair.

This is an assessment process.  For the benefit of the residents, we cannot go into it here an individual basis but it is a thorough process, as was outlined by Dr. O'Brien.

I have been reading and catching up on the opening statements.  I have been reading the reports.  I have even listened back to some of the recent podcasts and interviews with the residents in Midleton, as well as with residents of the Owenacurra centre and their family members.  I do not think that I seen a community rally around mental health services in the way I have seen it done in Midleton.  It is clear that people in the Owenacurra centre are part of the community of Midleton.  They are not apart from the community of Midleton; they are actually a part of it.  We often talk about integrated living and integrating different parts of the community.  This is one of the best examples that I have seen.  I heard one man talking on the radio about how he goes the local coffee shop to meet his friend.  I have no idea if his friend is another resident in the Owenacurra centre, or if his friend is a resident in Midleton; it is none of my business.  However, he goes into Midleton to meet his friend for a cup of coffee on a regular basis.  That is his routine.  Residents of the Owenacurra centre have their families, their neighbours and their routines, just like anybody else in society.  We need to put the flesh on the bones of this.  They are not statistics; they are real people and this closure will impact on them.<\/p><p>The closure of this facility will have a detrimental impact on the residents of the Owenacurra centre, its staff and the wider community in Midleton.<br\/><br\/>I will make a couple of charges that are not directed towards Mr. Fitzgerald but to the HSE in general.  From reading the report, to me the HSE has been complicit in, and is responsible for, allowing the Owenacurra Centre to get into a rundown state and creating the situation in which we now find ourselves.  Mr. Fitzgerald, in his opening statement, said the immediate priority of the HSE was &quot;the welfare of the 19 residents of the centre&quot;.  Where was this priority in the years that the lack of investment by the HSE allowed the building to get to the state it is in now?  This is the situation we are in now.  I will put this issue in context.  These residents are real people.  If they were living in a house and their landlord neglected to maintain their home, they would have recourse through a number of agencies, including the Residential Tenancies Board.  In this case, the HSE is the neglectful landlord.  Where is the residents' recourse?  How do they go about getting recourse?  <br\/><br\/>To address the other side of the issue, from all the evidence I have heard, the service provided in Owenacurra is very good.  If it were not, people would not be fighting to stay in the centre and continue to use its services.  <br\/><br\/>I will ask questions on the building and then ask about assessments.  Mr. Fitzgerald has answered my question on the building already, but I will ask it again.  Has the HSE explored every option available to allow the residents to remain in their current home?  Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned the future use of the site.  Was any consideration given to building a new centre on the current site and upgrading the current building to allow the residents to remain <i>in situ <\/i>and keep them in a safe space in the meantime?

Deputy Sherlock referred to the respite part, which is not technically known as respite but I understand that every two weeks two residents use the centre for respite purposes.  There is also a residential centre and the day care.  Could Mr. Fitzgerald provide certainty with regard to the three services and that they will be retained in the town?  As my colleagues said, they serve not just the town of Midleton but also Cobh, Youghal and as far as Glenville.  It is a massive area of east Cork which is, in fact, the size of some counties.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that this was notified to us last June.  I have been told by some of the families that realistic engagement with families did not happen until last week, and one member said that it is not going well.  Of the 19 residents there, with how many has agreement been reached at this stage that they would move to another location, whereby the families, residents and the HSE are happy?  Where are we now in respect of the 19?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021092100002#P00800","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I will refer the second part of the Deputy's question to Dr. O'Brien shortly.

If the HSE could hold off on closing Owenacurra until that was ready, a fine building would be available in the old Midleton hospital that could be used in the interim for residents in Owenacurra.  I am putting that suggestion on the table.<\/p> <p>  Another suggestion that came up last night, was if the HSE would consider building a purpose-built centre in Midleton.  The HSE has other grounds there, not at Owenacurra.  The overwhelming request and pleading from the meeting last night was for the HSE to please not evict these residents against their will and preference, to use Mr. Fitzgerald's own words, and against the wishes of the community and all the elected representatives who turned up.  There was cross-party agreement at the meeting, as there is here today.  I ask Mr. Fitzgerald to do anything he can to hold off on that.  As he said, October is not set in stone but is, rather, an arbitrary date that was picked out of the air.  We were told of this in July and I am told that families only had real engagement on this matter in the past week .  Families are very upset about it because they want proper engagement.

They will not in their communities anymore.  The fact is that they can walk down to their local library.  Everybody knows and welcomes them in the shops.

We have four home-based treatment teams, one of which is specifically for the east Cork region and the communities of Midleton, Youghal, Cove and Carrigtwohill.<\/p> <p>  We also have a seven-day service in the community.  This means that individuals can be seen every day if that is the level of support required.  The introduction of that service has proven to be invaluable to individuals and their families when they have periods in which they require increased support.  These teams have multidisciplinary support, so, again, they serve to enable individuals to address matters that are causing them either difficulty or distress.  The input of social work, occupational therapy and psychology is invaluable, and the community supports are very strong.  This year, we have a psychiatry of later life community service that now covers all of Cork.  Up until that, we would not have had a service for all of east Cork but now we do.

Today we have with us Mr. Bob Collins, chairperson of the Policing Authority; Ms Helen Hall, chief executive of the Policing Authority; Mr. Dale Sunderland, deputy commissioner at the Data Protection Commission; Mr. Gary Russell, assistant commissioner at the Data Protection Commission; Mr. Liam Herrick, executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties; Ms Doireann Ansbro, head of legal and policy at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties; Mr. Philip McAnenly, general secretary of the Garda Representative Association; Mr. Brendan O'Connor, vice president of the Garda Representative Association; Ms Rachel Woods, assistant secretary of criminal legislation at the Department of Justice; and Ms Maeve-Anne Kenny, assistant principal of criminal legislation at the Department of Justice.

When witnesses are speaking, I ask them to ensure they unmute themselves but to mute themselves again after their contribution to avoid interference in the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before I move to our guests' opening statements, I want to advise about parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements, therefore, are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses, in particular those attending remotely from a place outside of the Leinster House campus, they should be aware there are some additional limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present in the complex.  Our guests are probably aware of that at this stage but it is important to reiterate that.<\/p><p>The same goes for members.  Again, members will be familiar with the practice and precedent of parliamentary privilege and how it works.<\/p><p> The format of the meeting is that I will invite each organisation to make an opening statement up to a maximum of five minutes.  Once all opening statements have been delivered, I will call on the members of the committee in the order in which they indicate to me to put their questions.  In the time remaining, if there is time remaining, there will be an opportunity for members to ask supplementary questions.  The duration of the meeting is limited, so I ask everyone to be focused in their contributions.<\/p><p> I will call on each organisation to deliver its opening statements.  Not every witness I welcomed will give an opening statement but each organisation certainly will.  Mr. Bob Collins from the Policing Authority is the first up.

This is a welcome and necessary Bill.  The facility of recording has benefits for both garda&iacute; and the public alike and is in part a reflection of our times and must be regulated.  The authority also welcomes the changes that have been made to the initial draft heads and is pleased that some of the measures which it proposed and which others, no doubt, have proposed have been incorporated in whole or in part.  These measures that have been accepted can be of benefit to public safety, to the prevention of crime and to the promotion of effective policing.<br\/><br\/>As with most things in life, however, there are conditions attached to that welcome and that approval.  The experience of facing the task of policing during the health emergency has highlighted the importance and the real value of public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, especially in terms of protecting its legitimacy when exercising extra powers while at the same time vindicating our human rights.  It is a crucial contributor to this sense of legitimacy that the right balance be achieved between powers and rights.  These new technologies - body-worn cameras and closed circuit television - if not used with caution and with external, transparent and independent scrutiny, can be a barrier to the trust the public has in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can hinder the perception of its legitimacy and can infringe basic human rights.  In previous submissions the authority identified a number of principles it believes must be underpinned in the legislation, and there is value in noting them very briefly.<br\/><br\/>Regarding device neutrality and a clear framework, technology constantly changes, sometimes with dazzling speed, and it is important this Bill is device-neutral.  That has two dimensions.  It is vital the principles that underpin this Bill are not confined to the technologies we know and that those principles can be applicable to any devices that may emerge in future.  Related to that is the fact such new devices may have potential and consequences currently unknown or unimagined.  It is reasonable to say that if this Bill were being drafted and discussed five years ago, nobody would have foreseen the possible uses to which drones can be put now and the nature and scale and miniature nature of that particular technology.  That principle requires that the framework of the measure is adaptable to future circumstances and that the code of practice be sufficiently strong and sufficiently flexible to reflect and govern what new technologies may emerge.  This will help in avoiding new technologies being evaluated on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis and avoid the use of devices not contemplated in this measure or their use in policing contexts not currently envisaged.<br\/><br\/>Ethics and proportionate use is the second principle.  We welcome the fact the Bill provides for the development of codes of practice for recording devices and CCTV.  This provides the opportunity to reflect the tests of fairness, ethical behaviour and proportionality of use that are of central importance.<br\/><br\/>The use of these technologies in some respects can see both the infringement and the vindication of human rights, at times simultaneously.  Even if properly applied, their use will infringe on rights such as the individual's Article 8 right to privacy for both members of the public and Garda members, and the public's rights to free expression, free assembly and free association.  To ensure the intention implicit in the decision to require a human rights impact assessment is made real, the authority would wish to see a requirement rather than an enablement to consult the public in the preparation of the codes of practice.  This should also be required in respect of any amendment to any one or other of the two codes.  The authority would also like to see an external dimension beyond the consultative process in the undertaking and in the analysis of any such human rights impact assessment.<br\/><br\/>In welcoming the identification and inclusion of a number of statutory consultees, the authority would also wish to see the requirement that any review of the codes or of the statute taking account of the extent of their use, that is, the use of these technologies, any evaluation of their impact and any trends in respect of complaints concerning any aspect of their use.  The authority would also reiterate its previously expressed concern about the process by which requests from lawyers to access footage in which clients are captured will be handled and at what point they will be given access.  This is at the very least, we believe, something that should be provided for in the statute and specifically included in the codes of practice.<br\/><br\/>There are principles of transparent oversight and accountability which require that the powers given and their exercise are transparent to the public, are subject to independent oversight by an external body and are clear as to where accountability lies.  We identify at least six elements, which I will note very briefly, to achieve this.<br\/><br\/>The Bill should require that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na employ a comprehensive process of reliable and published recordings of the incidence of the use of these technologies.  The Bill should include reference to the development of a robust mechanism to review, appeal and oversee decisions to use the technologies under discussion.  It should make appropriate provision for the making available of relevant recordings to GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate, or their successor bodies, to inform their investigations and inspections.  It should ensure visibility.  We believe that unless the circumstances require a covert installation, it should be made explicit in the legislation that the public be informed about the existence and operation of a CCTV system, whether fixed or mobile.<br\/><br\/>An overly centralist approach should be avoided in authorising the installation and operation of CCTV.  We acknowledge clearly the advantage of having a single point of decision-making, in the person of the Commissioner, because that provides consistency of application and avoids unnecessary and sometimes unwarranted CCTV installations.  However, we wish to emphasise the importance of some measure of local engagement, especially in circumstances in which a refusal is contemplated.  This would allow meaningful community input while not diminishing the decision-making capacity of the Commissioner.  We would also suggest that the decision-making should not be capable of being delegated beyond a deputy or assistant commissioner so as to retain that clarity of consistency throughout the State.<br\/><br\/>Finally, we think the measure or the code should require that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na publish, annually at least and perhaps more frequently, the number of authorisations sought, granted or refused in respect of access to a third party CCTV on a live feed basis.  This would give a sense as to whether the use of this power was confined to genuinely acceptable circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Collins.

I also thank the committee for the opportunity to have made written submissions on the proposed Bill.  At the outset, as a general observation, the implementation of any digital recording system should give us pause in terms of reflecting on the interference with rights and freedoms of individuals.  However, it is equally the reality that limited use of such systems is a necessary tool in the armoury of any police force.  The aim, therefore, particularly from a data protection perspective, should be to ensure appropriate limitations, safeguards and balance of rights in the underpinning legislation.<\/p> <p>  In commenting on the Bill, I wish to emphasise that the obligations on public authorities and bodies processing personal data for law enforcement purposes flow from EU law, in particular from the 2016 EU law enforcement directive, which was transposed into Irish law in the Data Protection Act in 2018.<\/p><p>This requires that any legislation enacted concerning the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes must have full regard to, and align with, the requirements of the directive and the 2018 Act.  While it is the Data Protection Commission&rsquo;s overall assessment that the Bill largely aligns with the requirements of the directive and the 2018 Act, we have made a number of observations in our written submission which we believe require further consideration.<\/p><p> I will turn to some of the key provisions of the proposed Bill, which we have highlighted in our submission.  In particular, Part 2 concerns recording by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for specified purposes.   The Bill provides a legal basis for the processing of images and sound of individuals by garda&iacute; and designated others for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, including the safeguarding and prevention of threats against public security.  However, it should be noted that nothing in the Bill appears to provide a legal basis for the processing of special category data in CCTV or other smart camera recording systems that support capability to profile automatically or recognise automatically and track individuals such as the use of facial recognition technology.  If it is the intention of the Legislature that such processing is to be permitted, it would need to be very explicitly and carefully provided for in legislation.<\/p><p> Concerning the provision for the use of body-worn cameras by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we welcome that such devices must be visible on the clothing or uniform of members and must have a visible indication that the device is recording.  In particular, the requirement for a code of practice on the use of body-worn cameras will be critical to ensuring the use of such technology is proportionate and that the resulting data is properly secured and is not used for other purposes beyond what is provided for in law.<\/p><p> Regarding Part 3, we welcome the provisions relating to the authorisation of CCTV systems to be used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community groups.  These provisions address issues of concern arising from a number of statutory inquiries the DPC initiated into the deployment of surveillance technologies by State agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities, in support of their various functions.  In particular, the DPC&rsquo;s inquiries identified significant flaws in how community-based CCTV schemes are regulated in law, including how they interact with section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 dealing with the authorisation by the Garda Commissioner of Garda and community CCTV systems.  We therefore welcome that the Bill will ensure CCTV authorisations by the Garda Commissioner are issued to local authorities rather than individuals or groups.  We also welcome the requirement that the local authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are to be joint controllers for community CCTV systems.  We also welcome the provisions throughout the Bill on various compulsory codes of practice.  Such codes will be necessary to satisfy fully the requirements of the law enforcement directive as well as the standards of clarity, precision and foreseeability in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p> While noting that codes may be laid before the Oireachtas, we recommend, as the Policing Authority has referenced, that consideration should be given to the means by which the codes can be more widely published.  We further recommend that a public consultation should occur before the making or updating of such codes.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for giving of their time.  I am very happy to any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":630,"content":"<p>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, thanks the committee for this opportunity to participate here today.  I am joined by our executive director, Mr. Liam Herrick, and we are both happy to answer questions.  In this statement I will summarise our key concerns with the Bill, as outlined in more detail in our written submission.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL welcomes the inclusion of requirements to carry out data protection and human rights impact assessments as well as the requirements to consult the Data Protection Commission and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission ahead of the creation of codes of practice.  We note the inclusion of some requirements for consideration of necessity and proportionality for authorising surveillance, which we also welcome.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL recognises that digital technology may offer a valuable tool in the detection of crime.  However, it considers this Bill will vastly expand the surveillance powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without sufficient evidence these developments are necessary in the Irish context, proportionate to the risk they pose to a range of rights, or that there are sufficient data protection safeguards.  The ICCL also questions the proposed expansion of surveillance powers while, as we understand it, there are ongoing inquiries by the Data Protection Commission into the compliance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with data protection law.  We note the deeply concerning findings last June while recognising what the representative from the Data Protection Commission has just said in terms of welcoming aspects of the Bill.  We note the deeply concerning findings last year that indicated a generalised failure by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to comply with data protection law.  It is in that context the ICCL would call on the Government to pause any proposal to expand Garda surveillance powers until such time as there are satisfactory, proper and sufficient policies and practices to ensure data protection law is being complied with.<\/p> <p>  We have previously expressed our opposition to the introduction of body-worn cameras for garda&iacute; given the risks to privacy and data protection and, in our view, the glaring absence of conclusive evidence from other jurisdictions that they contribute positively to policing or justice outcomes.  We call on the Government to abandon plans to introduce body-worn cameras or, alternatively, we call for more research to demonstrate they are necessary in Ireland, including through the introduction of a pilot programme before a general roll-out of them.<\/p> <p>  The Bill proposes a significant expansion in the use of CCTV by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by providing access to real-time live feed from non-Garda or third party CCTV cameras.  We have identified some serious and ongoing risks with the use of CCTV and we call for more research into the effectiveness of CCTV in both preventing and detecting crime before Garda access is expanded.<\/p> <p>  We also call for greater safeguards around the use of drones given their increased risk to privacy and transparency.  We question whether sufficient safeguards are in place for the proposed expanded use of automatic number plate recognition technology.<\/p> <p>  In our written submission we have made 22 specific recommendations on how we believe the Bill can be strengthened.  Those include the following five key issues.  The lawful purpose assigned to the use of recording devices is too broad and may lend itself to an overuse of such devices.  The definition of what constitutes a recording device is vague and may pave the way for the introduction of new technologies such as facial recognition technology without sufficient debate, research or a demonstration of their necessity in the Irish context.  We note that facial recognition technology has renowned ethnic, racial and gender biases and has enabled mass surveillance and discriminatory targeted surveillance elsewhere.  We also consider there are important distinctions in law between the thresholds and safeguards which must apply to both covert and overt surveillance.  We consider the requirement of visibility of recording devices for overt surveillance is not sufficiently addressed in the Bill and provisions on covert surveillance would appear not to be accompanied by sufficient safeguards.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is also not clear regarding who has the authorisation to install, use and access recording devices.  We note the DPC's concerns, outlined in its report last year, that there has been excessive access to monitoring stations within Garda stations.  We call for greater transparency on this issue and accountability where policies and protocols are not followed.  While recognising the provision that a recording device itself does not have to be produced in court is practical and therefore welcome, we call for the provision at head 20(A)(3) on the admissibility of evidence to be removed.  In our view such decisions should remain strictly with the courts.  The apparent proposal to exclude garda&iacute; from criminal liability under the legislation should be removed or it should be made clearer that garda&iacute; can be held criminally liable if they commit any of the offences that are created by this Bill, including the offence of tampering with recording devices.<\/p> <p>  Digital surveillance presents a direct interference with the right to privacy and impacts a range of other rights.  We urge the Government to pause any expansion of Garda surveillance powers at a time when there are clear findings that existing powers have been misused.  We call for any revision of surveillance powers to be accompanied by robust safeguards, including adequate oversight, to ensure our rights are always protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Doireann Ansbro"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for providing us with this opportunity to meet them and make a submission.  I want to take just ten seconds to point out we were somewhat surprised and even astounded we were not given the same opportunity when the general scheme on policing, security and community safety Bill was released.<\/p><p>As we represent almost 100% of the 11,800 rank-and-file and front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we believe it might have been an oversight on the part of the committee to not include us as a stakeholder.  We ask the committee to reflect on that.<\/p><p> On the GRA's position, the availability of body-worn cameras has the potential to enhance the safety of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and protect them against malicious and vexatious complaints and from that point of view, this development is very welcome.  Body-worn cameras also have the potential to gather better evidence to assist in the prosecution and, ultimately, the conviction of offenders.  If we look at the context, the increasing level of assaults against garda&iacute; is well documented and in 2020, almost 1,000 of our members were assaulted in the course of their duty.  Garda&iacute;, like many other victims of crime, often express frustration that the penalties imposed on assailants are unduly lenient and do not reflect the severity of the attack.  Body cameras allow a judge and jury to relive the experience of the assaulted officer from a very unique viewpoint.  The camera, after all, does not lie, as long as the chain of evidence is properly processed and protected.<\/p><p> Our Garda members approach the debate around body-worn cameras from the perspective of protecting themselves and their colleagues.  However, the benefits also extend to the victims of crimes that our Garda members investigate.  As first responders, garda&iacute; are often present at crime scenes in the immediate aftermath.  The appropriate use of camera technology provides an impartial and clinical recollection of crime scenes, road traffic collisions and comments made by both the victims and the suspects.<\/p><p> While the body-worn cameras are welcomed, the current draft of the Bill may cause confusion and fear among garda&iacute; because there is a suggestion that we may be subject to both civil and criminal liability and prosecution.  If it is directed that members wear body-worn cameras in accordance with an agreed protocol and procedure, with appropriate and essential training, a garda should not be at risk of private or civil actions.

This is an important Bill.  It brings together a number of areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na either currently records the activities of the general public or where it intends to do so in the future using up-to-date recording technologies.  It is important that we get this right and that we provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a robust, modern statute that is fit for purpose.  Work commenced on this Bill when the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland reported on and supported the deployment of body-worn cameras.  It seemed like an ideal opportunity to not only legislate for that but to update the law in a number of areas where recordings are made for law enforcement purposes.<\/p> <p>  Some people will have concerns about the Bill, some of which have been raised already, but there is no reason to be concerned.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention that this will be a strong and effective piece of legislation that will provide the Garda with additional powers, but will also contain considerable safeguards and protections for the citizen.  In drafting the general scheme, the Minister has considered the invasion of privacy that is involved in recording.  The Constitution protects people's right to privacy.  Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights states, \"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\"  However, this right is not absolute.  Police authorities may not infringe on this right unless it is done in accordance with the law, is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or for the prevention of disorder or crime.  Therefore, activities that restrict our privacy rights must be prescribed by law, must be necessary to achieve a legitimate aim and must be proportionate to the aim being pursued.  Throughout the general scheme one will see the powers that are being given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the purpose of the recording and a stipulation that the recording must be necessary and proportionate.<\/p> <p>  We have placed considerable emphasis on the establishment of codes of practice by the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with stakeholders, regarding parts 2 and 3 of the Bill.  In preparing the codes of practice, the Commissioner must ensure that a data protection impact assessment and a human rights impact assessment are carried out.  The Commissioner must consult various bodies such as the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and may consult other bodies appearing to have an interest in the matter.  The bodies mentioned have all been consulted on the drafting of the general scheme.  The final version of the code of practice will be submitted to the Minister to be included in a statutory instrument and laid before the Houses.  <\/p> <p>  I will not go into the details of the Bill as all members have had a good look at those already.  I will just say that it is our intention, and the Minister's, that this Bill will fully comply with international human rights instruments and with data protection law.  There are requirements for review on a regular basis to ensure that each provision is operating as we would expect.  In terms of oversight, the ultimate oversight will be provided by the courts in deciding if the recording has been obtained legally and is admissible as evidence.  In head 21, we have included temporary provisions for a designated judge to keep the operation of parts 4 and 5 of the Act under review.  It is our intention to replace this provision with the arrangements for an independent examiner of security, which will be provided for in the policing, security and community safety Bill.  Whichever provision is ultimately included will depend on the progress of each Bill through the Houses.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee.  My colleague and I are happy to take questions and will try to address any concerns raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Woods.

The Bill refers to the purposes for which the technology will be used and provides that a data protection impact assessment is mandatory.  The Senator may be aware that regardless of the type of processing, the data protection impact assessment requires that a very detailed work-through of all the elements of the data processing is done including the data captured and how they are captured, the purpose of the data, for how long they will be retained and how they will be retained.

Obviously, violence of any nature should not be condoned but, as they say, the camera does not lie.  When a body camera is turned on, however, it could give a perception of an event that may not be accurate.

As it evolves, I would imagine that the process will help to eradicate such behaviour if it was to take place, and that it will be plain to see if something was taken out of context.  A jury, a judge or an investigator from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission would have the same clinical approach in taking things as they are presented and deciding on whether there is something missing.

This will give confidence to those people who have doubts about how garda&iacute; conduct their duties, and particularly in communities where relations can be improved and where there may be a perceived mistrust among some parties.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked when the cameras would be switched on.  Obviously, again we come back to the protocol.  We must be mindful of citizens' right to privacy and when it is appropriate to record.  Generally, we would probably expect to see this being used in situations that are confrontational.  A tourist approaching a garda on O'Connell Street looking for directions is not going to want to have his or her image or audio recorded.  That would be inappropriate.  There are other such circumstances, for example, with a victim of sexual assault or a person seeking advice from a garda on a personal issue.  It would not be appropriate to record those interactions.  This is where we will find guidance in the protocol.  These systems are tried and tested in other jurisdictions and hopefully the protocol will reflect what has been learned.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to gathering evidence at crime scenes.  One of the big success stories from the perspective of victims is in relation to domestic violence.  We are all well versed that there has been an increase in domestic violence.  I believe it is more likely for a person to be a victim of homicide in domestic circumstances than in any other circumstances.  This seems to be the case across the world.  In our experience, one could go to the same location time after time and witness a vulnerable person being the victim of an assault or violence on repeated occasions and never having the confidence to make that statement to outline what happened, or where perhaps making the statement can revisit the trauma.  When a police officer is on the scene who has a recording of the trauma and how the person was reacting, it can gather the aggression and the attitude of the offender or suspect.<\/p><p>It creates an excellent piece of evidence and allows a jury or a judge to see what the victim was subjected to.  The benefits are huge for victims of crime and also in terms of efficiencies within the criminal justice system.  There has been an emphasis and focus within the organisation on training so that we can provide a more effective response to domestic violence.  This is a key part of that strategy and we would see it as bringing huge benefits for victims, particularly victims of domestic violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I agree there is a huge opportunity there because, as Mr. O'Connor has said, it can be such a difficult thing to get a report and to be able to gather evidence.

The organisation has the capacity to use it for a specified purpose but there are issues around the protocol, how that is put together, the consultation involved, how often it is reviewed and by whom.  These issues are important both in terms of the protection of privacy and also of efficacy.  When the camera is switched on is important and that is about the judgment of the individual member.

We do not yet have the detail as to what will be defined as evidence but we cannot have a situation where the data gathered from these cameras is kept forever.  I do not think anybody intends that to be the case, notwithstanding the points that were made earlier about it making sense to keep certain data for long periods but what provision is there in that regard?

The destruction of data that no longer serves a purpose or cannot be retained any longer due to the statutory codes that will be put in place is a different matter.  I understand the length of time for which the data will be retained will be dictated by the data protection impact assessment.

This is an essential and important question, and the Senator is correct in raising it: how long will data be retained for?  That will have to worked out.  The Bill in its current form provides a statutory obligation, which exists under data protection law anyway regardless of the Act.  However, it is further emphasised and provided for in the Bill in that those issues must be assessed thoroughly.  In meeting the requirements under data protection law - as I highlighted in my opening comments and submission - this Bill together with the codes of conduct go toward satisfying the requirements of the law enforcement directive and requirements under EU law.  The Bill in itself does not do that.  It will require the development of those codes and the layout of those codes, in a statutory sense, before the Oireachtas to satisfy the requirements of data protection law.

The Bill states: \"In addition to the consultations undertaken [with certain named persons] the Commissioner may consult with any other person or body appearing to the Garda Commissioner to have an interest in the matter.\"  I would argue that we should be looking at full public consultation on these codes of practice in regard to their initial creation and renewal.  I believe the general public has an interest in this matter.  Will there be any scope during drafting to include a requirement for public consultation?  I have another question which may be that of a new Deputy.  Head 7(5) states: \"Where the Minister receives a draft code of practice ... he or she may by order declare that the code, scheduled to the order, shall be a code of practice.\"  I ask that clarity be provided on how much scope the Minister will have to vary or change what he or she receives at that point in time.   I have a couple of other questions for the Department around drafting issues.  I will run through some points and then come back in.<\/p> <p>  Head 15 deals with temporary approval for access to third-party CCTV.  Several of the heads before head 15 deal with the issue of an application by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to adjudge for authorisation, in the same manner that is done for a search warrant.  However, there is no urgency test in the temporary approval as is required under Criminal Justice (Search Warrants) Act 2012.  If there are circumstances where judicial approval is not practical, we need to state that there is an urgency in those situations.  The lack of an urgency test is concerning, and I ask that it is addressed in drafting.  The period allowed under the Bill is 72 hours which, again, speaks to a lack of urgency.  If 72 hours of recording is allowed, that strikes me as something that should - as contained in the previous heads - go before a judge for independent judicial assessment and authorisation.<\/p> <p>  Head 9 states how CCTV will be operated on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Will witnesses provide clarity on who they envisage will operate that?  I am conscious that the definition of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, under head 2, includes civilian Garda staff.  If we outsource the monitoring of CCTV to persons outside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we will lose some of the transparency and oversight of protocols, rules and training that currently exist in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and which give security to those activities.<\/p> <p>  Under head 8, no difference is made between overt surveillance and covert surveillance.  Will that be addressed?  There is a lot of talk about the need for recording equipment to be identified.  Obviously, there are cases where a crime is being investigated and the last thing one wants is a giant sign that reads \"there is a recording device here\".  From my perspective, we are getting into an area - covert surveillance - in which we need to balance rights.  Should we be seeking warrants for covert surveillance?  Is there an intention to address the difference between overt and covert surveillance?  I will leave my questions at that for now.  I may ask one more question afterwards, if I have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#G00600","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":674,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want any particular individual to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#G00700","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I will do my best to go over those questions.  On the codes of practice and the question around a public consultation, the heads provide for the possibility of public consultation on the human rights impact assessment.  I appreciate that the matter the Deputy spoke about is wider than that.  That is certainly something which can be taken into account.<\/p> <p>  On head 7(5) and the Minister's role in approving the codes of practice under Part 2, the Minister is a person to be consulted in regard to the preparation of the codes.  The idea is that the Minister and other bodies will already have been consulted and given the opportunity to express their views as to how the code should be structured and what detail should go into it.  Ultimately, the Minister will have the discretion not to sign such an order should he or she believe it would not be appropriate.  The Minister will have an opportunity at a stage earlier than that to provide input, if necessary.<\/p> <p>  On head 15 and the temporary access to a third-party CCTV, this is a provision that is intended to be used in circumstances where it is necessary to get access at short notice.  If that is not particularly clear in the heads, it can be addressed in drafting.  That is the intention behind head 15.  I refer to CCTV and other parties who may make an application to the Garda Commissioner.  These provisions are modelled on what is provided for under section 38 of the Garda Act.  That relates to potential contractors for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and relates to Garda surveillance only.<\/p><p>I further understand that no such authorisation has been granted to date in respect of that category of persons who may apply.  <\/p><p> Finally, on head 8 and CCTV, and the issue of overt versus covert, I return to head 2 and the interpretation section where the definition of \"CCTV\" provides for optical devices in public place.

The possibility of Garda access to third-party CCTV opens the possibility of a broad volume of surveillance information being accessed by the Garda.  Head 13 provides strong judicial oversight of that power.  However, head 15 potentially completely circumvents and undermines that protection because if the Garda can access this third-party material on Garda authorisation for 72 hours, there will be a strong temptation to use that provision and circumvent the judicial oversight.

On the recording of the devices on Garda body cams, will an independent record be kept of the time the recording commenced and when it stopped?

With all the best intentions, we can say that that is not the purpose of this legislation.  However, class bias is already built into technologies and into algorithms before we even put the CCTV cameras up for their intended use.  How do we safeguard people from working class communities who will probably be disproportionately affected by the use of cameras in their community?<\/p> <p>  This legislation talks about prevention of crime.  I do not think that anyone should be under the illusion that this would prevent crime.  In particular in the places where there will be calls to put CCTV, the crime will just move to another location.  This is about the detection of crime.  My concern is that if we look for crime in particular places, we are going to find it.  The most important thing for me will be how the decisions will made about where we look.  Whatever about the technology not being set out to profile people, the decisions are already set to profile people.  This is because decisions will be made geographically, by socioeconomic class, and about particular communities where there is a high amount of deprivation that results in a particular amount of criminality at whatever level.  The profiling will have, therefore, already happened before the CCTV camera even goes in.  This is what makes me nervous.<\/p> <p>  From the point of view of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, how do we ensure that we can protect people from being disproportionately impacted by the use of technology in terms of their civil liberties, their race, their class and everything else that is already built into technology that we have not even procured but for which will have legislation?

We have already seen through research in other jurisdictions that using facial recognition technology has a negative and disproportionate impact on people of colour and on women.  This is because of misidentification, as well as because of biases that are built into, as the Senator said, the algorithms in that the unconscious biases of the developers are often reflected within the development of this software.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how to protect people, it is important to note that the EU in the proposed regulation on artificial intelligence has suggested that facial recognition technology should never be used in a public place.  We need to be cognisant of that.  I would highlight that this is contrary to what is in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na modernisation plan 2016-2021, which states that it plans to use facial recognition technology to track suspects from CCTV, as well as to use technologies such as face-in-the-crowd and shape-in-the-crowd biometrics.  We would be highly concerned about any use or potential use of facial recognition technology.  We need to specify that that will not be used in the Irish context.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that the current Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na code of practice states that automatic facial recognition technologies are prohibited.  In our opposition to body-worn cameras, we have also noted concerns in other jurisdictions, where they have been more used in communities that are already over-policed.  This is having an impact on trust and on community policing between the people who are policed and the police themselves.  It also potentially impacts on garda discretion itself, where a garda is able to use his or her discretion on whether or not something is pursued.  There are a lot of ramifications and this is why we are calling for more research and for a pilot project before there is a general roll-out.  There are a lot of ramifications that we need to consider before such software is rolled out.<\/p> <p>  One other point is about this idea that potentially new software can be included in this legislation.  I understand the rationale is that safeguards should be applied to any future technology.  However, we need to be cognisant that the rapid development of technology and software at the moment poses new and unforeseen risks to rights.  That is why we say that future technology should be assessed individually, on a case-by-case basis, to make sure that the impact on rights is not disproportionate.

Not that long ago, the Department rolled out the CCTV community scheme.  I worked with my local community scheming to try to get that scheme up and running.  It was for CCTV cameras around our towns and villages to combat crime and to have this type of evidence.  However, there was huge difficulty in terms of the data storage, data protection and data retention.  At the time, after lots of toing and froing, I realised that the onus for that data protection and data storage lay firmly with local authorities.  In my experience, local authorities were not willing to take on that role.<\/p> <p>  In this particular Bill, which is about digital recording, has that been given any consideration?  This has an important role to play in crime prevention and in the gathering of evidence.  It could be an opportunity.  I would like the Department&rsquo;s view.  My experience is that communities probably missed out a lot on that scheme, because there was much resistance from local authorities to take on that role.  I think that is understandable.  My view is that role should not be with the local authorities.  They are nowhere near geared for data protection, retention or storage.

Certainly, the Minister has committed to carrying out a review of CCTV, in tangent with the drafting of this Bill, to ensure that community voices can adequately be reflected in the new arrangements for community CCTV under the draft law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve-Anne Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Do the Garda representatives have a view on the scheme up to this point?

We had the same issues.  Around the country there were some very good quality cameras in place.  We were using them to investigate crime.  However, issues arose, as the Deputy highlighted, in relation to who the data controller was.  In my own division in Letterkenny, we had a problem where there is a CCTV system that is quite similar to that which operates in Dublin city centre.  Yet, unlike in Dublin, the county council in Donegal was the data controller, even though garda&iacute; in the communications room were actually controlling the joystick.<\/p><p>There are, therefore, huge logistical issues.  In rural communities then we had the situation where funding and grants were available, which bodies like Muintir na T&iacute;re were trying to draw down, but it seemed to get lost in bureaucracy, obligations and problems.  We would certainly hope this legislation addresses that I believe it was the intention of Part 3 of the Bill to do so.<\/p><p> It is a huge issue, however, and it is impacting on the effectiveness of rural policing whenever we are trying to do more with less and maybe with Garda stations being closed.  Unfortunately, we would never see CCTV as a substitute for policing but it does complement policing.  We can definitely relate to the problems highlighted by the Deputy.  We would like to see those sorts of things addressed because there is a huge problem there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#K00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smyth.

I want to continue some of my questions to the Department about elements of the drafting that I am concerned are unnecessarily broad and concerns about a lack of safeguards.<\/p><p>Head 5(1) sets up that the use of the recording will be in areas where garda&iacute; are legally permitted to be, where they are authorised by law or where they are expressly invited or impliedly invited.  That kind of context is missing from head 9.  Head 9 could apply to the use of drones and be about enabling them.  Essentially, we are missing a safeguard that is in a previous head with regard to the use of drones.  That is particularly important in the context of whether the garda&iacute; should need a warrant with regard to the use of drones in monitoring somebody's private house.  I would like to see that discrepancy addressed.  Will it be possible to address that discrepancy in the future drafting?<\/p><p>One of the other issues then is with regard to head 18.  When read in the context of the definitions in the interpretation in head 2, the &quot;relevant data&quot; seem to be relegated to &quot;Automatic Number Plate Recognition&quot;.  If that is what it is about, why not say that?  The reading of head 18 as it stands now, without that context from head 2, seems to be very concerning.  It seems to give <i>carte blanche<\/i>in terms of investigatory powers and demanding data.  It would be a watering down of many of the protections and requirements for getting a warrant or judicial warrant with regard to phone or bank records or things like that.  As I said, the way it is drafted means it is about the relevant data under head 2, which are defined simply as &quot;Automatic Number Plate Recognition&quot;.  I do not understand why head 18 is drawn so broad for one small piece of data.  Again, that is part of my theme about unnecessary broadness and a concern around lack of safeguards.<\/p><p>They are the issues I would like to see addressed along with head 15 in relation to a lack of urgency test and an unnecessarily long period of 72 hours.  I appreciate there are times when evidence may be destroyed when there is a need to act quickly from the garda&iacute;.  As I said, however, if we compare that to other legislation around warrants and searches, there is an urgency test as well as the idea of  independence and the rank of superintendent or higher, which is entirely missing from head 15.  The Department might comment on those points and whether those concerns will be addressed during the drafting process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#K00400","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I would just make that clarification.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the definition of \"relevant data\" in head 18 and head 2, naturally, the final definitions in the Bill, when it is presented to the Houses, will be subject to agreement of text with the Attorney General.  This is a broad intention of the policy behind it.  Perhaps our definitions are not necessary and the Attorney General will, no doubt, advise on that.

I had to leave the meeting earlier to go the Chamber and so I missed many of the contributions.  I welcome all the speakers this afternoon.  The bit that I heard has been very informative.  It would appear that there is quite a journey to go yet with regard to this particular legislation.<\/p> <p>  First, I will make a comment on CCTV.  I respectfully suggest that any community watching the debate this afternoon is probably doing so aghast when it comes to the installation of CCTV in towns throughout the length and breadth of the country.  My experience is that the process is very cumbersome and time-consuming.  I am aware of a couple of examples in my part of the world where applications for CCTV seem to go on for an eternity.  I do not know whether that particular issue can be addressed by this legislation.<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome CCTV.  I believe it acts in the prevention as well as the investigation of crime.  I know of many incidents where positive outcomes have resulted from it.  I am, therefore, very much a fan of CCTV.  Having said that, it is important we balance that with citizens' rights and we must also be very cognisant of victims of crime when we discuss matters like this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the body cameras, a number of speakers have alluded to the rapid development of technologies.  That is very true and it is a question of how legislation keeps up with that rapid development of technology.  It is a challenge and it is important.  I do not know if a commitment was given here that this piece of legislation will adapt and be flexible with those advances in technology.  That is vitally important.  What have been the learnings, good and bad, from the experiences of other jurisdictions that have adopted body cameras over a period?<\/p><p>How can we take those learnings and adapt them for our system?<\/p><p> My next point may have been covered earlier and if it has, I apologise.  I am thinking of a practical situation where a member of the Garda arrives at the scene of a disturbance or whatever.  At what point are garda&iacute; meant to inform the individual or individuals concerned that they are turning on a camera or videoing the scene.?  It is important that people know that.  Someone could begin videoing this meeting at this point and have a totally different perception of the meeting and contributions by the end.  What is the opinion of the Department and others, including garda&iacute;, who want to speak about that?  <\/p><p> Are there clear parameters and guidelines on the use of devices and at what point recording commences and is terminated?  A garda could arrive at a situation that is quite calm but that could explode in a matter of seconds.  How can the guidelines and framework in the Bill be adopted from a practical day-to-day point of view?  What has been learned from other police forces?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#K01000","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":705,"content":"<p>Does the Senator want to nominate any particular witness?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#L00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Whoever wishes to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#L00300","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":707,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Department might answer the first question on how cameras would be activated or how a person would be notified.

Outside of that, subject to whatever discussions may arise in the context of consultations and data protection and human rights impact assessments, additional standards can be imposed on the use of body-worn cameras.<\/p> <p>  Other jurisdictions have comprehensive codes in respect of how body worn cameras are deployed.

The evidence that we are aware of is that the use of body-worn cameras has a very positive effect in many cases on crime prevention and the behaviour of the participants or persons involved in an interaction that may escalate and get out of control.  Oftentimes, the use of a body-worn camera can be preventative in that respect.<\/p> <p>  I also do not accept that crime is not preventable and crime simply moves on.

I am sure we will be in touch with most if not all of them very shortly as they are all regular contributors.<\/p> <p>  As per our normal practice, it is proposed we publish all the opening statements on the committee website.  Is that agreed by the members?  Agreed.  I ask members to stay on the call as we will deal with a bit of private business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#M00800","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632178800,"counter":727,"content":"<p>The joint committee went into private session at 5.26 p.m. and adjourned at 5.29 p.m. until 3.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 22 September 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
