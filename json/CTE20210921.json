We have received no apologies.  As we return to participating at committee meetings in person, I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending and to practise good personal hygiene.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after meetings.  Masks should be worn at all times during meetings except when speaking.  I ask for the full co-operation of members on this.  I apologise for the late start; I was expecting to see everybody in the room.  Some members are in the room and the rest are participating remotely.<\/p> <p>  The first item of business is the minutes of our meetings of 29 June, 1 July, 6 July, 8 July and 13 July.  These have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matter in the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's webpage.<\/p> <p>  A total of 58 sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 5 July and 17 September.  These should be appearing on the screens now.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address the accounts and statements before opening to the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#B00100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632218400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  In the interests of efficiency I will quickly mention the accounts that have been presented.  Obviously after a long break over the summer there has been a significant accumulation of accounts.  If the schedule is put on screen, members will see it starts with departmental and other funds.  The export guarantee account has a clear audit opinion.  The credit union fund account has a clear audit opinion.  The motor tax account, which had a turnover of &euro;938 million, has a clear audit opinion.  The finance accounts, with a turnover of &euro;61.8 billion, also have a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  In the education sector, the accounts of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology received a clear audit opinion.  Limerick Institute of Technology also received a clear audit opinion.  Mary Immaculate College received a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to procurement non-compliance, which is disclosed in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p><p>I also draw attention to the deferred pension funding asset recognition, which is a standard issue for universities and colleges of education.  There is a clear audit opinion for the National College of Art and Design but attention is drawn to the deferred pension funding asset.  There is a clear audit opinion for the Higher Education Authority.  There is a clear audit opinion for Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh, but, again, I drawn attention to procurement non-compliance and deferred pension funding asset.  Again, this is standard for universities.  There is a clear audit opinion for Institute of Technology Sligo and Athlone Institute of Technology.  <\/p><p> The financial statements of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, or Caranua, for 2020 get a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to continued inadequate control over grant payments.  I have drawn attention to this matter for a number of years with regard to Caranua.  The residential institutions redress special account had a turnover of &euro;1 million in 2020 and gets a clear audit opinion.  This is the payment relating to compensation payments made to former residents of residential institutions.  <\/p><p> There are two sets of financial statements regarding Home Building Finance Ireland Lending Designated Activity Company, DAC.  These relate to 2019 and 2020.  The company is a subsidiary of Home Building Finance Ireland and its consolidated financial statements were presented in a timely manner.  However, there was an oversight relating to the presentation of the accounts for 2019 for the subsidiary.  A clear audit opinion was given in both cases.  I will not name all of the NAMA subsidiaries' accounts 17 to 26.  There are ten in total.  These are the subsidiaries of NAMA.  Again, the consolidated accounts were presented earlier.  <\/p><p> There is a clear audit opinion for the HSE for 2020.  I will not repeat the items to which I drew attention last week when I opened for the HSE accounts examination.  There is a clear audit opinion for Tusla, or the Child and Family Agency, but attention is drawn to significant non-compliant procurement and the ICT security breach.  It is the same security breach as occurred with regard to the HSE.  Because Tusla relies on the HSE, it was affected by the security breach.  There is a qualified audit opinion for the National Cancer Registry for 2020.  The accounts for the National Cancer Registry are prepared in accordance with FRS 102, which is the standard accrual accounting standard.  The accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable.  This is something that occurs with a number of health bodies.  I will draw attention to that in each case.<\/p><p> The National Haemophilia Council gets a clear audit opinion.  The Mental Health Commission gets a qualified audit opinion on the same basis I referred to previously.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service gets a clear audit opinion.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority gets a qualified audit opinion - again in respect of the accounting for retirement benefits as they become payable.  The Medical Council gets a clear audit opinion.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund gets a qualified audit opinion on the same basis.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland gets a qualified audit opinion on the same basis.  The Health Insurance Authority gets a qualified audit opinion on the same basis.  I should point out that in respect of the accounts of the Health Insurance Authority, the turnover was &euro;2.7 million.  That relates to its administration costs only.  There is a separate account presented with its annual report that relates to the risk equalisation fund and the turnover on that was &euro;771 million.  A clear audit opinion was given in respect of that.<\/p><p>On State bodies, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority get a clear audit opinion on its 2020 accounts.  The Marine Casualty Investigation Board gets a clear audit opinion.  SOLAS, with a turnover of &euro;837 million, gets a clear audit opinion.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment 2020 accounts get a clear audit opinion.  The Commission for Communications Regulation accounts for 2019-20 get a clear audit opinion.  The National Transport Authority accounts for 2020 get a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to some non-effective expenditure on an ICT project.  Enterprise Ireland gets a clear audit opinion.  The National Oil Reserves Agency, with a 2020 turnover of &euro;121 million, has a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to ineffective expenditure in note 3, relating to &euro;250,000 incurred in respect of an onerous lease contract.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Office of the Planning Regulator gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Economic and Social Research Institute gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which had a turnover of &euro;1.5 billion, gets a clear audit opinion for 2020 but attention is drawn to non-compliance with procurement rules.  The Pensions Authority gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Road Safety Authority gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, with a turnover of &euro;136 million, gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Gathering Project 2013 is a dormant company but I still have to issue an audit opinion on it, and that was clear.  The Residential Tenancies Board gets a clear audit opinion for 2020 but I draw attention to delays and cost increases in the delivery of a new management system for tenancy registrations and disputes that is estimated to cost &euro;5.2 million.  IDA Ireland for 2020 has a turnover of &euro;218 million and it got a clear audit opinion.  Finally, Waterways Ireland, which is a North-South body that I audit jointly with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, had a turnover of &euro;43 million.  This is the 2019 financial statements; there were delays relating to the completion of the financial statements for 2019 but we issued a clear audit opinion in that regard.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  My apologies for that taking so long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632218400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>With regard to number 28, which is Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, the Comptroller and Auditor General notes that attention is drawn to significant non-compliant procurement.

The issue of deferred pension funding comes up repeatedly, and there are other pensions, such as those in the health services, that Mr. McCarthy stated are funded as they go.  Are pensions for universities and colleges funded in advance?  Are they fully funded?  How does that work?  Mr. McCarthy might give us a note on that.  I presume the cost of the liability for pensions in the health bodies is fully captured by the Department of Health.  I presume that cost is included in the health budget as we go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#E00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632218400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Yes.  In the case of universities, the accounts are required to recognise the liabilities that are incurred in the year as a result of staff working.  An actuarial process is gone through to estimate the pension liability that accrues.  There is an assumption in that case, and this a matter I am drawing attention to, that the liabilities will be meet in the future as they arise.  The actual amount of funding provided in a year is tailored to take account of the liabilities as they arise.  The funding is provided on an as-you-need-it basis in relation to pensions.<\/p> <p>  There is a complication with the universities in that they are required by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to maintain what are called pension control accounts.  That is a buffer that forms, in some cases, funding used by the universities as part of their working capital as they go, but in some cases there are deficits.  Most of the universities are operating two or, perhaps, three pension schemes.  It is a very complicated funding arrangement but, as I said, the accounting liabilities are fully recognised there.<\/p> <p>  A different approach is taken with the health bodies.  It does make things much more complicated.  The liabilities that have already accrued in relation to health bodies are not recognised in the Department of Health's financial statements.  The Departments operate on a cash basis so there is no accrual for pensions that have already been incurred.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does a periodic exercise to try to estimate the total of the liabilities.  I think it does that about every three years.  I cannot remember when the last exercise was done.  There may be some reference to that in the finance accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1632218400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>There is a significant issue here in that most of this will be a liability into the future for anyone who is working at the moment.

It might be something that would be worth, at some point, putting a little time into, probably next year.

Given the extent of what happened there, and we certainly do not want to be giving information to people whom one does not want to get that information, understanding that and having a proper understanding of how it can be avoided is something that we should consider examining, perhaps in a year's time or early next year when there is full sight of exactly what the fallout is from it.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is the National Transport Authority, NTA.

I note he says there were inadequate controls over grant payments.  We discussed that with the representatives previously, but the Comptroller and Auditor General might refer back to me.<\/p> <p>  Also, there is Tusla and the significant non-compliant procurement.  That is something we must flag, and likewise with the NTA and the ICT project.

It is in the public interest that in our public institutions such as universities we understand who exactly is sponsoring or undertaking training within particular disciplines.  We are not asking for the names of hundreds and thousands of sponsors or corporate donors to be published; we are asking that where a course is significantly run by a private entity, the public institution should state that clearly, particularly when there are regulatory issues relating to that industry.  I am unhappy with that answer from the university.

Looking at section 3.2 on page 14, a number of sets of legal proceedings are either concluded or under way.  A new set of proceedings was brought against IBRC during 2020.

The latest board was appointed following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  The CEO gave a commitment to contacting the individual who raised this matter with the committee.  As agreed on 13 July, we forwarded this item to the individual but, as set out in R0759, which we will come to, Screen Ireland has not yet made contact.  I propose we request an update from Screen Ireland on its undertaking to contact the individual as well as a breakdown of the percentage of its funding in recent years that has gone to companies associated with board members.

I propose that we take this correspondence with No. 765B, which also addresses the matter.  It is from the Department of Health and dated 25 August 2021.  It is a response to the committee's request for the Department to clarify that the committee \"will be provided with the report on the progress review of the National Paediatric Hospital including the cost of the project, and a timeframe for its completion\".  This follows on from our two meetings with the hospital board in the last term.  The response to our request for sight on the analysis remains the same.  It states that \"Any discussion of costs, however hypothetical or otherwise, at this time, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract, and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the Development Board in its engagement with the main contractor, and the Board&rsquo;s responsibilities for the timely completion of this critical project.\"  While we must take the Department at its word, its position means that we do not have information as to the final cost and completion date for the largest capital project ever undertaken by the State and it appears we will not have that information for an extended period.  I propose that we note and publish this item.  I have flagged it for discussion because we are being strung along.  <\/p><p> Members will recall that, last November, we decided to bring in the board of the new paediatric hospital being developed.  We also asked the Department of Health to come in.  We put that back to the new year because the report on progress and estimates as to the final cost were not available.  We brought the board in on 9 February.  We thought we would get information that day but we did not.  We were told that we would have it soon after.  The months passed by and the information still did not come.  We had the board in again before the summer break but still did not get the information at that time.  We have also visited the hospital.  I do not know what the other members think but I believe we are in a ludicrous position.  The taxpayer is funding the largest capital project in the State.  We are digging deep into pockets and pay packets but we have no idea what the final cost will be and we have no idea about the timelines.  We went out and saw the project.  I do not know about the rest of the committee but, after seeing it, I had more questions than I did before.  It might be an architect's showpiece but I would question how practical or functional some of it is.  <\/p><p> This situation is totally unsatisfactory.  I do not know if other members want to come in on this but the Committee of Public Accounts cannot sit back and take this.  We are being fobbed off by the Department.  How long does it take the Department and the hospital board to come up with a progress report and timelines for the project?  The public need to know what this is going to cost every one of us.

Mr. Peter Boylan has put out the idea that perhaps one of the ways to address the critical needs around the new national maternity hospital is to provide a service at the children's hospital for critical care so that babies requiring such care could be born in that setting and have their needs addressed, as an interim measure if there is a need to look at alternative models for a new national maternity hospital.

There is a difference of approximately 25% between the lowest tenderer and the highest.  It is about how costs have increased dramatically in the past number of months.

Ultimately, from our perspective as a committee, we must know the bottom line of how much the State will pay for this hospital.  This has been rumbling on for years and certainly from that correspondence there does not seem to be any bottom line here.

There were not enough construction workers on that site.  The point I made at a previous meeting was that contracts go both ways.  There is an obligation to pay for the work that is done but, equally, there is an obligation to do the work that is contracted for.  That slippage is potentially very problematic because we can see there is a significant problem with building costs inflation.  That is one of the issues in respect of which I think we need to understand where the controls are.  This will not be the last hospital we will build.  It is to be hoped we will not in the future build hospitals in the same way as the national children's hospital has been built in terms of how the tender process worked.<\/p> <p>  I remember very clearly one occasion on which witnesses were before this committee to discuss this.  When you tender for something and then you make changes, that is where costs are going to arise.  For example, there were changes to the hand basins.  They were going to be changed to stainless steel for infection control purposes.  I would have thought that was self-evident hospital infection control.  You put in your maximum at that stage because it is going to cause you a problem if you do not.<\/p> <p>  We need to be learning lessons as well as everything else from what went wrong with this project in terms of the escalating costs.  If we do not learn those lessons, we are going to repeat exactly the same mistakes again when we go to build another hospital.  Already we are talking about the very controversial location for the national maternity hospital because of the ownership of the site.  First it was &euro;300 million, then it was &euro;500 million, then it was &euro;800 million, so there is a very significant issue here with procurement.  This is a project in respect of which we can better understand where things can go wrong and how things can cause more problems than anticipated.  It is very important we properly scrutinise that so we understand it and we look at the contractual side, because if it is in the interest of a contractor, whether it is this site or any other site, to elongate the timeframe for something at a time when there is building costs inflation, of course the timeline is going to slip and of course it is going to cost more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092100002#R00100","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1632218400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I have just noticed that at the very end of Eamonn Quinn's letter he says, \"The Department is aware that the ...

Therefore, the Department cannot provide any information as to why the building has been left vacant or why it has not been maintained.<\/p> <p>  The Department goes on to set out its role in sport promotion and efforts to secure a permanent ice rink facility in Ireland, including engagement between Sports Ireland and the Irish Ice Hockey Association.  The Department states that Sport Ireland was in the early stages of conducting a feasibility study on the development of a permanent ice rink facility as part of the Sport Ireland National Sports Campus.<\/p><p>No. 738 is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, dated 13 July 2021.  The Secretary General notes that DkIT has responded to the committee, and states that, in terms of governance arrangements, the role of the Minister and the Department is set out in the Technological Higher Education Association code of governance.  However, the Department goes on to state that while it has a sanctioning role under the code of governance regarding material acquisition or disposal of land, including long-term leases, this sanctioning role \"is distinct from the conduct of lease negotiations and operational decisions generally in relation to how DkIT manages and utilises its properties\".  It goes on to say that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in commercial negotiations.<\/p><p> No. 739 is from Professor Michael Mulvey, president of DkIT, setting out a detailed response to its purchase of the then JJB Sports site for &euro;3 million, which includes the Ice Dome.  DkIT received sanction from the HEA for the purchase in 2012.  The correspondence sets out that the purchase was central to its Campus Development Plan 2011-2021.<\/p><p> DkIT states that the Ice Dome was not operational when purchased and that somewhere in the region of &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 million would be required to bring it back into service.  As it wants to maintain control of the property in case it wants to expand its campus, which it states is particularly relevant in the context of its ambition to become a technological university, DkIT intends to continue its efforts to lease the premises.  Essentially, DkIT does not have the financial resources to bring the Ice Dome back into use nor is doing so aligned with its long-term strategic objectives.<\/p><p> DkIT states that it intends to lease the Ice Dome to a tenant with the financial resources to bring it back into service.  In respect of its negotiations over several years with the Irish Ice Hockey Association, DkIT states that &ldquo;the association was afforded every opportunity to present a proposal that met the requirements of the Institute&rdquo; and that it requested a final proposal from the association in February 2021.  DkIT did not deem it to be viable, stating that it presents &ldquo;too high of a commercial and operational risk for the Institute.&rdquo;<\/p><p> No. 740 is from the vice president of the Irish Ice Hockey Association, dated 12 July.  As mentioned, the association has been in negotiations with DkIT to lease the Ice Dome, but ultimately, DkIT did not deem the association&rsquo;s final proposal viable with the end result that we have a decaying ice rink with an owner not interested in using the facility for its intended purpose; an ice hockey association with no ice rink which is unusual to say the least; and no permanent ice-rink facility in the State.<\/p><p> The association has submitted extensive and detailed correspondence on the matter over a number of years, including Sport Ireland&rsquo;s 2018 support in principle for the association&rsquo;s bid to reopen the Ice Dome, subject to the costs being met by the association.  The association has also provided the minutes of DkIT&rsquo;s governing body&rsquo;s meetings, which are publicly available.  They detail DkIT&rsquo;s consideration of the matter, from its intention in 2017 to sell the Ice Dome to the current decision to lease it.  <\/p><p> The association&rsquo;s 2018 business plan notes that the United Kingdom has 63 ice facilities and that New Zealand, a country of similar demographic and history of ice sports to Ireland, has four indoor arenas.  I thank members for their patience on listening to me outline the gist of the current situation.  I will now open the floor to members.

No. 741B, dated 12 July 2021, is from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs, RT&Eacute;, and provides information requested by the committee on a range of issues.  No. 754B, dated 30 July 2021, is also from RT&Eacute;.  I propose we take the two together.<\/p> <p>  Part of the information requested by the committee on a number of occasions was the amount paid by RT&Eacute; to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of a Revenue audit inquiry into the engagement of contractors by RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; states that, as the process has now concluded, it can disclose the amount paid to Revenue was &euro;1.223 million.  Members will recall that, at a meeting earlier in the year, we extracted the fact it made a settlement.  We had also requested information on the parallel audit being conducted by the Department of Social Protection.  RT&Eacute; states it is ongoing but no interim payment has been made to the Department.  As with the Revenue process, RT&Eacute; states it is unable to provide more detail until the audit has concluded.  That is obviously relating to the employer's liabilities in respect of each employee.<\/p> <p>  On the committee's request that RT&Eacute; conduct a comparative review of the remuneration of Irish-speaking workers at Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and their counterparts in RT&Eacute;, first made at our meeting with RT&Eacute; last April, RT&Eacute; states it has appointed a company with specific experience in the media sector to carry out a full evaluation of all staff roles and grades in RT&Eacute;.  Irish language roles will be part of this review, which was set to commence this month.  This review follows on from the recommendations contained within the role and gender review report conducted by Mr. Kieran Mulvey on behalf of RT&Eacute; in 2017.  One of the key recommendations in Mr. Mulvey's report was to review and simplify its current structure, which has 167 different grades.  RT&Eacute; states it is following through on this recommendation and, while it cannot undertake to conduct also a review specific to any one service, it will be addressed as part of the wider review.<\/p> <p>  I propose we note and publish this correspondence and ask RT&Eacute; to provide us with the findings of the social protection audit as well as the findings of the organisational review as soon as they become available.

Agreed.<\/p><p> There was correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood that officially outlined for the first time that RT&Eacute; made a settlement with Revenue regarding people who were wrongly classified as self-employed, or what is referred to as bogus self-employment.  That has been an important step forward for the Committee of Public Accounts but we need to know much more about the payments.  What were they for?  How many staff members does that payment take account of?  What about other staff?  Does the payment cover only what the State was owed or does it cover compensation to those 11 workers?  We need to know more about the audit that is being carried out by the Department of Social Protection and the number of workers involved in that.  We need to know more about what RT&Eacute; is doing about these contracts and workplace practices around the classification of employment and what is sometimes referred to as bogus self-employment.  We have got the figure of the settlement between RT&Eacute; and Revenue.  As soon as the figures relevant to the Department of Social Protection and the PRSI contributions that are due in that regard are available, we should look for that information.  I request that we correspond with RT&Eacute; and thank it for the information that has been provided.  We should also highlight there are other specific pieces of information we want.

That is not RT&Eacute;'s fault because defamation laws require urgently to be changed.  Every media outlet has a particular issue with the current defamation laws.  Perhaps if we got that figure back, we could follow through to the Department to seek a change.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the Revenue audit, Eversheds did a two-year look-back in the report it conducted.  I am sure Revenue will not be limited by that because I think some of the staff who had a change in their employment status, those who became employees as opposed to contractors, would have flagged up this issue for some considerable time.  A Revenue audit will be dictated by Revenue.  It will decide the parameters as opposed to the entity being audited.  I suspect Revenue will go back further than Eversheds did.  Revenue will dictate that.  The important thing is that if Revenue does not provide that report, if the amount of &euro;1.2 million changes, we will see that in the RT&Eacute; accounts.

The RTE report indicates that there will be no payments to the Department of Social Protection, that the Revenue Commissioners have responsibility for the collection of taxes and that the payments that were made by RTE include PRSI.

We also wrote to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this regard, and that response will come before the committee at the next meeting, at which we will consider the correspondence.  The issue arose from our engagement with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of planning permission for data centres which are huge users of electricity and water.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications referenced the Government statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's enterprise strategy, which was published in 2018 and states that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, Ireland's independent energy and water regulator, has responsibility for policies regarding the national grid.  The commission works with EirGrid and the ESB networks to issue connection offers to the grid.<\/p><p>The Minister stated that planning permission and grid connections are separate requirements, and while planning permission must be in place before grid connection is sought, planning permission does not guarantee grid connection.  <\/p><p> A consultation on the future development and operation of the electricity system was launched last March, and focuses on the need to cater for the transition to 70% renewable energy by 2030 as well as increased demand.  The total electricity requirement for large energy users, including data centres, is set to more than double by 2030.  The Minister stated that a number of actions have been taken to ensure continuity of supply, given data centres' implications for the national grid over the coming years.  In a paper published in June, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities acknowledged that some form of intervention is necessary and a consultation process has now closed.

Being increasingly confident that we have electricity is not a standard of public service that the public expects from Government or from a Government Minister.  Given that this matter has come into focus since the committee last met, I suggest, with the Chairman's permission, that we write the Minister to seek information on any potential rolling blackouts or his Department's views the cause of such blackouts.  This should be done in light of the fact that a significant amount from the public purse has been spent in recent years on upgrading green energy and indeed on the grid itself, and also given what we know about the drain on electricity and water supplies that these data centres represent.  We know that these centres are popping up and there are probably more planning applications in for data centres in this State than across Europe.  The drain on our electricity and water supplies must be weighed against an average of 50 jobs per centre.  Given the relationship with our water supply, it is nowhere near fit for purpose or up to standard as it is.  Yet, there seems to be no taking into account of the drain that these data centres represent.

The Minister has come out in recent days, and, as I understand it, has said that there is nothing to worry about and there will not be blackouts.  However, we know that on those frosty, dark nights, the wind does not blow, so there are no wind turbines moving.  We also know that there is no sun on those nights, so the solar panels will not work.  Therefore, we are heavily dependent on the gas-generating stations and we know there are difficulties with that.  We also know that there are plans to import some temporary generators.  As the Committee of Public Accounts, we have a right to ask about continuity of supply, because if the lights go out, the whole thing is banjaxed.<\/p><p>We have the right to know about the potential costs of any temporary generators or other interim solutions that are brought in.  To follow on from the issues raised by the previous speakers, this is the area on which to focus.  I am concerned that we have closed down the peat-burning power stations in the midlands, because we are moving away from peat.  I understand the logic in that.  However, this morning, a shipload of peat arrived from Lithuania.  My understanding is that it travelled almost 3,000 km.  I would like somebody explain to me the logic of all of that.  I do not get the logic of it from an economic point of view or from the point of view of reducing carbon emissions.<\/p><p> There is a real issue around electricity generation and the response from the Minister on the data centres.  On the one hand, we are dishing out planning permission for data centres as a State while on the other hand, we are importing generators to use as stopgap measures to keep supply to the grid.  As a result of this, we, as the Committee of Public Accounts, need to ask questions about the security of supply, the cost of the generators, and their projected costs going into the future.<\/p><p> I propose that we note and publish the correspondence we have on the outcome of the consultation process.  That has been agreed.  I also request that we seek further information from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Gas has become precarious.  There are some, including the Minister, who raised concerns in the past about using gas as a transition fuel.  I raised that concern with him at the climate action committee three years ago.  Back then, he told me that importing electricity generated by nuclear power was preferable to using gas.  However, this is where we are at that moment.  The immediate concerns are: the security of supply; the implications all of this has on the public purse; and the implications of the costs of interim solutions, such as the use of generators a stop-gap solution.

The package collectively aims to make the EU&rsquo;s climate, energy, land use, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, in line with the decision of the European Council.  The European climate law regulation, adopted in June 2021, has now given legal effect to the targets adopted by the EU Heads of State and Government.  The package is extensive and is currently being analysed and considered by both our Department and other Departments that have a role in it.  In parallel, the recent enactment by the Oireachtas of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 sets Ireland on a similarly ambitious decarbonisation trajectory for 2030, but it must be stressed that there are two distinct targets, each with its own measurement and compliance regimes.  The committee has indicated it wishes to focus specifically in its session today on the proposals to extend the EU emissions trading system to new sectors, COM (21) 551, and to establish a social climate fund, COM (21) 568.  The committee has received information notes from the Department on both of these proposals but I will briefly set out the key elements of each.<\/p> <p>  The EU emissions trading system, ETS, is a key pillar of EU climate policy architecture.  The sectors it covers, primarily electricity and heavy industry, are obliged to achieve a 43% reduction in their emissions by 2030 relative to 2005 levels.  The new proposal seeks to increase this target to 61% and to incorporate emissions from maritime transport within the overall cap.  This will be achieved by a steeper annual reduction in the available allowances of 4.2% instead of 2.2% per year under the current system, following a one-off reduction of the overall emissions cap by 117 million allowances, also known as \"re-basing\".  The Commission also proposes to gradually remove free emissions allowances for the aviation sector, which is already covered by the EU ETS for domestic and intra-EU flights, and to move to full auctioning of allowances by 2027 to create a stronger price signal to drive emissions reduction in the sector.  Accompanying changes to the system&rsquo;s market stability reserve will allow the system to absorb the historical surplus of allowances more quickly to help achieve this more ambitious overall cap.<\/p> <p>  The Commission is also proposing to extend the ETS to fuels used in road transport and buildings and for these to be covered by a separate cap, with distinct trading arrangements to the current system.  The new system will operate at the point at which transport and heating fuels are placed on the market rather than at the point of end use.  This will place the obligation on fuel suppliers, rather than households or drivers, to hold a greenhouse gas emissions permit, to report their emissions and to hold and surrender allowances to cover those emissions.  It is proposed to become operational from 2025, with a cap on emissions set from 2026 and with the objective of reducing emissions annually to yield an overall reduction of 43% in 2030 compared to 2005.  The Commission proposal indicates that the overall objective of this proposal is to ensure that sectors other than those currently included in the ETS contribute cost-effectively to the emission reductions needed in line with EU targets and Paris Agreement commitments, while ensuring synergies with other policies targeting those sectors.<\/p> <p>  To address the potential impacts arising from the fact that the fuel suppliers subject to this new regime are likely to pass on some of their costs to consumers buying road transport and heating fuels, the Commission has also presented a separately legislative proposal for a new social climate fund.  This proposal recognises that increases in the price for fossil fuels will have social and distributional impacts that may disproportionately affect those households, microenterprises or transport users who spend a larger part of their incomes on energy and transport and who may not have access to alternative transport solutions.  This could be achieved through temporary income support or investments intended to reduce, in the medium to long term, the reliance on fossil fuels through improving the energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonisation of heating and cooling of buildings, integrating energy from renewable sources and the provision of improved access to zero- and low-emission transport.  The proposal anticipates that a portion of the auctioning revenue from the new ETS for buildings and road transport will be allocated to the EU budget and from there to the member states for expenditure through the social climate fund.<\/p> <p>  Each member state will be required to develop a social climate plan, which will set out the measures and investments that will be financed from the new fund, as well as their expected costs and milestones and targets to achieve them.  Each social climate plan should, first, provide vulnerable households, vulnerable microenterprises and vulnerable transport users with the necessary resources to finance and carry out investments in energy efficiency and decarbonisation of heating and cooling in zero- and low-emission vehicles and mobility, and, second, mitigate the impact of the increase in the cost of fossil fuels on the most vulnerable and prevent energy and transport poverty.  It is proposed that &euro;737 million will be allocated to Ireland over the period for the first social climate plan from 2025 to 2032.<\/p><p>Member state allocations are calculated under the proposal according to an allocation key, taking into account population at risk of poverty living in rural areas, emissions from fuel use in households, households at risk of poverty with arrears on their utility bills, gross national income, GNI, and the member state&rsquo;s share of reference emissions for the buildings and road transport sectors.  Member states will be required to contribute at least 50% of the total costs of their social climate plan, with the costs of this expected to be borne by member states&rsquo; share of auctioning revenues from the buildings and road transport sectors.  A total fund of &euro;1.474 billion would, therefore, be required for Ireland&rsquo;s social climate plan over the seven years concerned.<\/p><p> The proposal to apply a separate trading system to road transport and buildings and to use revenues from the new system to finance the social climate fund would potentially reduce the funding available for Ireland&rsquo;s own measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In accordance with the programme for Government, revenue from increases in carbon tax is to be ring-fenced for climate purposes and is a key part of funding a just transition through targeted social welfare measures that protect vulnerable households against fuel poverty, fund socially progressive retrofitting schemes and partially fund a rural environment protection scheme 2, REPS 2, encouraging the uptake of greener and more sustainable farming methods.  Government policy is not to levy a carbon tax in sectors of the economy included in the emissions trading system as this would amount to a form of double taxation.  As the sectors proposed for inclusion in the new ETS for road transport and buildings are also subject to a carbon tax, this would require the Government to reduce the scope of application of this tax, therefore affecting expected future revenue from the carbon tax.<\/p><p> While a share of auction revenues from the new ETS would accrue to the State and funds would be made available to Ireland from the EU budget under the new social climate fund, these revenues are likely be significantly lower than those raised by the carbon tax.  It might be noted in this context that the full year yield from carbon tax in 2020 was approximately &euro;495 million, when the applicable rate was &euro;26 per tonne.  As the committee will be aware, the Oireachtas has also legislated for an annual schedule of increases in the rate of carbon tax through the Finance Act, which provides that the rate will reach &euro;100 per tonne by 2030.  I should stress that the Department and several other Departments are continuing to examine the implications of both proposals in light of the issues that have been identified and in the context of the wider Fit for 55 package.  The Minister proposes to brief the Government on the Department&rsquo;s initial assessments with a view to informing the position to be taken during the negotiations on each of the proposals in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  We are very happy to take any questions the committee members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Maughan.

The EU ETS covers electricity generation and large industry, and the carbon tax is not levied in those sectors, but is levied in other sectors of the economy where fossil fuels are used.  By extension of that policy, it would have implications for the future scope of the carbon tax.  That is not necessarily to say it is automatic.  This is a policy question and Government has not taken a policy position on it yet.  It is to draw the attention of the committee to this issue which arises by virtue of the proposal to extend the ETS into the road transport and heating sectors where the carbon tax currently applies.<\/p><p> The second question relates to the operation of the ETS in the new sectors and I will pass over to Mr. Regan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I will describe what the European Commission is proposing in terms of road transport and buildings.  First, it is important to say that the current EU system for road transport and buildings falls within the effort sharing decision.  Those two sectors plus agriculture and some others fall within the effort sharing decision which essentially means that each member state has a binding national target by which to reduce its emissions.  Ireland's current national target is 30% by 2030.  The Commission is proposing to keep the effort sharing decision and the national targets for these areas, but in addition it proposes to add this new system which provides carbon pricing for road transport and buildings.  It is essentially a separate emissions trading system from the one currently in place for electricity generation and industry.  It is completely separate with no linkages.<\/p> <p>  It is intended to commence from 2026 and, as pointed out by the Chair, it will not be applied at the point of emission as is currently the case for the ETS.  Rather it is applied at the point of release of consumption of fuels.  Essentially at the same place excise duty is applied, this new ETS system will be applied.  That is where the monitoring and accounting would take place.  What it does is that if a fuel supplier releases their fuel, they must have an equivalent certificate from the EU scheme, equivalent to the amount of emissions caused by that fuel.  The certificates available will be limited over time, and they will reduce each year in order to reach minus 43% emissions reduction by 2030.  This is a market which gets more scarce over time for the emissions to be released, which essentially puts a price on the carbon.<\/p> <p>  Another important point is that there will be a separate market stability reserve which will be used to dampen price fluctuations because it will be a market based mechanism so, unlike the carbon tax that is in place at the moment where there is price certainty, we can expect that carbon prices will fluctuate.  That market will be in place from 2026.  There will be a trial period of reporting only in the years 2024 and 2025.  That is two years of testing followed by implementation from 2026, with a reducing amount of allowances available each year to 2030.  Unlike the current system for large industry there will be no free allowances.  Everybody must get an allowance for the fuel when it is released.<\/p> <p>  The emissions savings as a result of this will count against each member state's target but it is a separate complementary mechanism, as proposed by the Commission.  It is not intended to replace the current member states' national targets for these sectors.  That is an overview of the current position.  I would note that member states have many questions in regard to how this will be applied and how it will work in practice, because it is quite a complex system to implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Regan.

My question is for Mr. Maughan.  I would like to tease out where he got that 737 million allocation for Ireland under the social climate fund.  Why is only 25% of the ETS going to be allocated to the social climate fund?  On the allocation key Mr. Maughan referred to in the opening statement, we do not really know the extent of fuel poverty in Ireland so how have we identified those households?  I know the 2015 report commissioned by the Department, when it used the objective indicator, said that fuel poverty could be as high as 28% and even as high as 50% in the north west.  The later report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2020 said we actually do not have sufficient data to use that objective measure from the 2015 report.  The fuel poverty strategy lapsed in 2019.  We were told we would have the Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicators to better measure fuel poverty by the close of 2020.  How have we arrived at the figure of 737 million and what indicators did the Department submit to the EU to get that figure?  I also ask Mr. Maughan to touch on why it is only 25% of the ETS that is going to the social climate fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#E00400","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The first part of the question relates to the amount of 737 million.  This is an outcome of the key that has been set out in the legislative proposal for assessing the distribution of the revenues that will accrue to the EU budget from the social climate fund, and that amount is included as an annexe to the legislative proposal.  It is broken down to 242 million in the three years 2025 to 2027 and a further 495 million in the years 2028 to 2032.  The reason it is broken down in that way is that the Commission is proposing that the revenues will be allocated to the EU budget, and the budget runs on a seven-year cycle which ends in 2027.  I understand that, from a legal point of view, the Commission needs to separate everything out into two separate sub-periods.  That explains that.<\/p> <p>  As a share of the overall total available for the social climate fund, Ireland's allocation would approximately be just over 1% of the overall fund and that is broadly in line with Ireland's share of population.  I will reiterate the elements of the allocation key: population at risk of poverty living in rural areas, emissions from fuel use in households, households at risk of poverty with arrears on their utility bills, gross national income, and the member state's share of reference emissions for the sectors concerned, that is, buildings and road transport sectors.<\/p><p>Thus the Commission does not specifically look at fuel poverty <i>per se<\/i>but it does take data which is published data and which is available to it and to everybody else from EUROSTAT and other published sources.  Data on utility bills, for example, will be available to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  This is based on the Commission's own examination of the data, not on data submitted by the Department.  This is obviously one of the things we will drill further into as the examination of this proposal progresses.<br\/><br\/>As to Senator Boylan's question on why limit it to 25%, that is not something I can answer too specifically.  It is what the proposal states.  The expectation is that of the share of revenues from the extended ETS, 25% will go to the EU budget.  Another portion will be allocated to an EU-managed innovation fund, which is an existing fund in place as part of the EU ETS competitive fund for the promotion of new technologies.  The remainder will be allocated to member states' budgets as auctioning revenues.  That is the broad breakdown of how the revenues will be allocated.  The Commission has chosen 25% for its own reasons.  It does not make a clear justification for that in the proposal but clearly the higher you go in terms of the percentage the more fluidity there is going to be about the revenues coming from the new ETS because as a market-based mechanism, the price of allowances in the scheme is likely to fluctuate, as is the case in the existing scheme.  In principle it would be difficult to fix a total amount that could or would be made to the social climate fund at a higher percentage.  I hope that answers the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I just want to clarify something.

The Deputy made a point about data, supporting Senator Boylan's point.  I have addressed the implications for the carbon tax in response to an initial question from the Chair already.  This will potentially have implications for the scope of the carbon tax but these are early stages.  These are policy decisions for the Government.

On the other side of the equation, we have clear data from the Commission proposal about how much of an allocation Ireland would be expected to get over the seven years of the proposal.  There is a difference between the two figures.  The annual carbon tax revenues are much higher than the average annual allocation Ireland would receive under this proposal.  It is not necessarily the case that all sources of carbon tax would be supplanted by this.  There are potentially other sources of carbon tax application which would not be covered by the EU emissions trading system, EU ETS, proposal.  The big issue that will be at play in the negotiations will be precisely where the EU ETS will land and what sectors it will cover.  That will impact on this too.

We have a lower amount of heavy industry than is typical and our agricultural emissions are higher than the average of other member states.<\/p><p>Looking at how they compare, 2030 is a key staging point for both.  The EU target is at least a 55% reduction compared with 1990 levels.  The climate Act states that there should be a 51% reduction from 2018 emissions.  The Deputy has correctly pointed out that the bases are different and, therefore, a comparison is difficult.  It is important to state that the emissions target for the ETS for large industry and electricity is an EU-wide target, so the 61% is not for member states but for the EU.  All that said, this depends on what assumptions are applied.  It is safe to assume that the climate action policy will be as ambitious in 2030 as the EU package.  Certain assumptions could be changed but that is safe to say at a high level.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's question about the sectors and how we track them, it is important to state that both our inventory for the national system and the EU system will be based on the IPCC guidelines.

The proposal as published by the Commission envisages that member states would prepare and submit a social climate plan by the end of 2024.  It has directly linked that to an existing deadline for member states to update their NECPs, which are in place to set out how they will meet their current climate and energy targets under the pre-existing 2030 targets framework.<\/p><p>The NECP has to be updated by mid-2024 and the Commission is proposing that the social climate plan will be submitted alongside that.  There is then a process whereby the Commission assesses the plan alongside the NECP.  Clearly, they will be looking for coherence between the two.  They will also be looking for coherence with member states' planned use of other EU funds, be it the Structural Fund or the Recovery and Resilience Facility, Ireland's plan for which has now been approved by the Commission.  There is a fairly extensive process envisaged on the Commission side and then the Commission will formally adopt a decision to approve the plan for the member state after which it can commence expenditure.<\/p><p> On the second part of the question regarding the overlap, the Commission is presenting the proposal effectively as if nothing is happening in the sectors already in terms of the types of interventions.  It does not address the question of whether member states can continue to do what they are doing.  This is one of the points that needs to be teased out.  What they say is that the funding can be used for two types of measures.  The first of these are temporary income support measures.  That is the type of measure the Deputy raised in respect of current types of social welfare supports.  That is the type of measure that is contemplated there.  The second type of measure is more in the line of household investments.  That will be issues such as energy efficiency - retrofitting of buildings, installing zero-carbon heating or, as the case may be, cooling systems such as heat pumps - installing renewable energy, for example, photovoltaic panels on the roofs of houses, and supports for access to zero-emissions mobility, which could be, for example, supports for the uptake of electric vehicles along the lines of the grants that are currently available from the SEAI.<\/p><p> It is clear that, across the various types of interventions, the Commission contemplates that Ireland is already doing a lot of these things.  The question we cannot answer right now is to what extent they will continue in parallel.  On the face of it, they could because if it is not separately being funded by the EU budget, there is nothing to prevent the Government continuing to fund those measures domestically.  It would give rise to questions of alignment and coherence.  One thing that comes out from the Commission proposal is that it anticipates that member states, through their social climate plans, will establish clear targets and indicators for what they will achieve by their proposed investments under the social climate plan and the release of funds from the Commission to the member states is contingent on the achievement of those targets.  It entails quite a degree of oversight by the Commission in terms of the expenditure of funding under the social climate plans and that would, in turn, give rise to questions about how money is spent in parallel through the Exchequer.  These are all issues that will have to be teased through in understanding how the types of interventions under the social climate plan would fit into the policy interventions and funding interventions the Government has in place or has planned over the coming years.<\/p><p> The other questions are related to the scope of the sectors that are proposed to be brought into the ETS.

Aviation is already in the current emissions trading system for intra-EU flights and flights within the EU are in the ETS.  However, there are considerable free allowances to the airline operators and a proposal now is to phase them out by 2027 so that, essentially, airlines would pay the full price of carbon from 2027.  For international flights outside the EU, there is a new agreement being put in place, called Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, CORSIA.

In fairness, it has been complemented by a renewables target which has been particularly successful in increasing renewables but the ETS has certainly played a role.  At a high carbon price, we will switch coal to gas which can reduce emissions.<\/p> <p>  The Commission essentially is saying that a price signal is needed to complement the transport and buildings sector and that, in the absence of it, the existing policies are not working.

Basically, money goes to large industry to innovate and decarbonise large factories etc.  That is a key part of the proposal.

That is before we even consider the situation with transport needs.  It was mentioned that it was early days in this context, but I regard this as more like the end days.

Those changes included increases in qualifying child payments, living alone allowances and fuel allowances and they were introduced specifically to respond to the increase in the rate of carbon tax, with a specific intention to counteract the effects in different household types.

Turning to issues with subsidiarity, this was identified in the Department's scrutiny note for both proposals.  The Deputy summarised it very well in respect of pinpointing the broad thrust of what will happen in this process.  As a result of these proposals, revenues being raised domestically through our taxation system may in future accrue, at least in part, to the EU budget and then be funnelled back to the member states.  Those revenues will also be distributed to the member states in a different way.  That is where there are concerns on our side about the overall thrust of the proposal and whether it will achieve the outcomes we are seeking as effectively as through our own taxation and expenditure policies.  I cannot offer a final judgment on that aspect today.  We are not at the stage where we can offer a definitive conclusion on this process one way or the other.  We are simply identifying the issues that this proposal raises for Ireland and other member states.  We are not alone in having a national carbon tax in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021092100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1632178800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>We are not alone in having a national carbon tax in place.

I refer to moving road transport and buildings.  You are probably talking about something like 30% of Ireland's overall emissions.  I think transport is 40% of energy-related emissions into another system.  Are we saying those sectors would be pulled outside of the effort-sharing system we have at the moment and does that effectively undermine the work that we have done to date, the Climate Act and the work that the Climate Change Advisory Council are doing, and the work to establish the sectoral emission ceilings?

The effort-sharing decision is the piece of legislation that covers targets for buildings, transport and agriculture.  Ireland's current target is minus 30% by 2030 and the proposal is a new target of minus 42% by 2030, so that is a considerable increase.  The Commission is not proposing to amend the effort-sharing decision to any significant degree.  It is one of the smaller files in this package.  It is not proposing a major restructuring of that legislation.  Essentially, it is proposing the new emissions trading system for buildings and road transport to complement the effort-sharing decision and not to put it aside.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I do not think it undermines the Climate Act.  Clearly the package is very complicated and is likely to change as it is negotiated over the coming years but the Act is clear and crisp about what needs to be done in Ireland, namely, overall carbon budgets and sectoral ceilings.  I do not think this package would undermine the Climate Act emissions targets, sectoral ceilings, etc.  The Climate Act is very well developed and will work in a clear way.

To put aside the fact that I and my party have issues around the emissions trading scheme, is it not the case that under the current emissions trading scheme 50% of the revenue raised is supposed to be allocated for climate projects?  Ireland is an outlier in that we do not ring-fence and we have been called out by the Comptroller and Auditor General because of that and the failure to provide a high level of detail on how we use that revenue.  If it was 50% under the existing emissions trading system and is now only 25% under a measure that will clearly impact on households rather than industry, would the Government's position going into the EU Council negotiations be that it would call for a higher percentage of the revenue to at least be targeted in that social climate fund?  Mr. Maughan said the memo is going to the Department but will this be considered by the Government?  It seems odd that it is 25% in this but they are asking for 50% in the existing ETS for climate-related issues.<\/p> <p>  The officials may not be able to answer this and I can refer back, but we were promised CSO indicators would come into place in 2020 to better identify those households which would be impacted by energy poverty.  Is there any indication of when we will see those CSO indicators as they are a crucial part of our doing those climate plans?  The programme for Government commits social transfers to address fuel poverty but we need to be able to identify the households which are most at risk and which would most benefit from retrofitting.

However, that is not directly comparable with the 25% figure in the current proposal because that figure relates to the amount of revenues that should be effectively diverted to the EU budget for the social climate fund.  The remainder of the revenues from auctioning, apart from the innovation fund, are to be allocated to the member states.

The first is to the innovation fund, a cross-EU fund to which large industry, such as cement and steel, can apply to try to reduce their emissions.  It is open to all member states.  That gets subtracted first.  The second is a modernisation fund, which is only available to member states whose GDP is 65% lower than the EU average and especially to support countries with a large coal power generation sector in which significant transformation has to take place.  The third subtraction is EU own resources for the funding of the EU institutions, for which a proposal is expected in the coming months.  What is left is allocated among member states and that cuts to Deputy's question.  That is based on the emissions from the member states.  It is carved out on where the emissions occurred.  It is a complex methodology but, in principle, that is how it follows.  It follows the same principle as the current system.

I would be cautious about inferring from those numbers because carbon tax is always only one of a number of policy tools in place across government to try to reduce emissions in the sectors on which it is levied.

All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements, therefore, are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses, in particular those attending remotely from a place outside of the Leinster House campus, they should be aware there are some additional limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present in the complex.  Our guests are probably aware of that at this stage but it is important to reiterate that.<\/p><p>The same goes for members.  Again, members will be familiar with the practice and precedent of parliamentary privilege and how it works.<\/p><p> The format of the meeting is that I will invite each organisation to make an opening statement up to a maximum of five minutes.

This is a welcome and necessary Bill.  The facility of recording has benefits for both garda&iacute; and the public alike and is in part a reflection of our times and must be regulated.  The authority also welcomes the changes that have been made to the initial draft heads and is pleased that some of the measures which it proposed and which others, no doubt, have proposed have been incorporated in whole or in part.  These measures that have been accepted can be of benefit to public safety, to the prevention of crime and to the promotion of effective policing.<br\/><br\/>As with most things in life, however, there are conditions attached to that welcome and that approval.  The experience of facing the task of policing during the health emergency has highlighted the importance and the real value of public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, especially in terms of protecting its legitimacy when exercising extra powers while at the same time vindicating our human rights.  It is a crucial contributor to this sense of legitimacy that the right balance be achieved between powers and rights.  These new technologies - body-worn cameras and closed circuit television - if not used with caution and with external, transparent and independent scrutiny, can be a barrier to the trust the public has in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can hinder the perception of its legitimacy and can infringe basic human rights.  In previous submissions the authority identified a number of principles it believes must be underpinned in the legislation, and there is value in noting them very briefly.<br\/><br\/>Regarding device neutrality and a clear framework, technology constantly changes, sometimes with dazzling speed, and it is important this Bill is device-neutral.  That has two dimensions.  It is vital the principles that underpin this Bill are not confined to the technologies we know and that those principles can be applicable to any devices that may emerge in future.  Related to that is the fact such new devices may have potential and consequences currently unknown or unimagined.  It is reasonable to say that if this Bill were being drafted and discussed five years ago, nobody would have foreseen the possible uses to which drones can be put now and the nature and scale and miniature nature of that particular technology.  That principle requires that the framework of the measure is adaptable to future circumstances and that the code of practice be sufficiently strong and sufficiently flexible to reflect and govern what new technologies may emerge.  This will help in avoiding new technologies being evaluated on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis and avoid the use of devices not contemplated in this measure or their use in policing contexts not currently envisaged.<br\/><br\/>Ethics and proportionate use is the second principle.  We welcome the fact the Bill provides for the development of codes of practice for recording devices and CCTV.  This provides the opportunity to reflect the tests of fairness, ethical behaviour and proportionality of use that are of central importance.<br\/><br\/>The use of these technologies in some respects can see both the infringement and the vindication of human rights, at times simultaneously.  Even if properly applied, their use will infringe on rights such as the individual's Article 8 right to privacy for both members of the public and Garda members, and the public's rights to free expression, free assembly and free association.  To ensure the intention implicit in the decision to require a human rights impact assessment is made real, the authority would wish to see a requirement rather than an enablement to consult the public in the preparation of the codes of practice.  This should also be required in respect of any amendment to any one or other of the two codes.  The authority would also like to see an external dimension beyond the consultative process in the undertaking and in the analysis of any such human rights impact assessment.<br\/><br\/>In welcoming the identification and inclusion of a number of statutory consultees, the authority would also wish to see the requirement that any review of the codes or of the statute taking account of the extent of their use, that is, the use of these technologies, any evaluation of their impact and any trends in respect of complaints concerning any aspect of their use.  The authority would also reiterate its previously expressed concern about the process by which requests from lawyers to access footage in which clients are captured will be handled and at what point they will be given access.  This is at the very least, we believe, something that should be provided for in the statute and specifically included in the codes of practice.<br\/><br\/>There are principles of transparent oversight and accountability which require that the powers given and their exercise are transparent to the public, are subject to independent oversight by an external body and are clear as to where accountability lies.  We identify at least six elements, which I will note very briefly, to achieve this.<br\/><br\/>The Bill should require that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na employ a comprehensive process of reliable and published recordings of the incidence of the use of these technologies.  The Bill should include reference to the development of a robust mechanism to review, appeal and oversee decisions to use the technologies under discussion.  It should make appropriate provision for the making available of relevant recordings to GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate, or their successor bodies, to inform their investigations and inspections.  It should ensure visibility.  We believe that unless the circumstances require a covert installation, it should be made explicit in the legislation that the public be informed about the existence and operation of a CCTV system, whether fixed or mobile.<br\/><br\/>An overly centralist approach should be avoided in authorising the installation and operation of CCTV.  We acknowledge clearly the advantage of having a single point of decision-making, in the person of the Commissioner, because that provides consistency of application and avoids unnecessary and sometimes unwarranted CCTV installations.  However, we wish to emphasise the importance of some measure of local engagement, especially in circumstances in which a refusal is contemplated.  This would allow meaningful community input while not diminishing the decision-making capacity of the Commissioner.  We would also suggest that the decision-making should not be capable of being delegated beyond a deputy or assistant commissioner so as to retain that clarity of consistency throughout the State.<br\/><br\/>Finally, we think the measure or the code should require that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na publish, annually at least and perhaps more frequently, the number of authorisations sought, granted or refused in respect of access to a third party CCTV on a live feed basis.  This would give a sense as to whether the use of this power was confined to genuinely acceptable circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Collins.

I also thank the committee for the opportunity to have made written submissions on the proposed Bill.  At the outset, as a general observation, the implementation of any digital recording system should give us pause in terms of reflecting on the interference with rights and freedoms of individuals.  However, it is equally the reality that limited use of such systems is a necessary tool in the armoury of any police force.  The aim, therefore, particularly from a data protection perspective, should be to ensure appropriate limitations, safeguards and balance of rights in the underpinning legislation.<\/p> <p>  In commenting on the Bill, I wish to emphasise that the obligations on public authorities and bodies processing personal data for law enforcement purposes flow from EU law, in particular from the 2016 EU law enforcement directive, which was transposed into Irish law in the Data Protection Act in 2018.<\/p><p>This requires that any legislation enacted concerning the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes must have full regard to, and align with, the requirements of the directive and the 2018 Act.  While it is the Data Protection Commission&rsquo;s overall assessment that the Bill largely aligns with the requirements of the directive and the 2018 Act, we have made a number of observations in our written submission which we believe require further consideration.<\/p><p> I will turn to some of the key provisions of the proposed Bill, which we have highlighted in our submission.  In particular, Part 2 concerns recording by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for specified purposes.   The Bill provides a legal basis for the processing of images and sound of individuals by garda&iacute; and designated others for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, including the safeguarding and prevention of threats against public security.  However, it should be noted that nothing in the Bill appears to provide a legal basis for the processing of special category data in CCTV or other smart camera recording systems that support capability to profile automatically or recognise automatically and track individuals such as the use of facial recognition technology.  If it is the intention of the Legislature that such processing is to be permitted, it would need to be very explicitly and carefully provided for in legislation.<\/p><p> Concerning the provision for the use of body-worn cameras by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we welcome that such devices must be visible on the clothing or uniform of members and must have a visible indication that the device is recording.  In particular, the requirement for a code of practice on the use of body-worn cameras will be critical to ensuring the use of such technology is proportionate and that the resulting data is properly secured and is not used for other purposes beyond what is provided for in law.<\/p><p> Regarding Part 3, we welcome the provisions relating to the authorisation of CCTV systems to be used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community groups.  These provisions address issues of concern arising from a number of statutory inquiries the DPC initiated into the deployment of surveillance technologies by State agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities, in support of their various functions.  In particular, the DPC&rsquo;s inquiries identified significant flaws in how community-based CCTV schemes are regulated in law, including how they interact with section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 dealing with the authorisation by the Garda Commissioner of Garda and community CCTV systems.  We therefore welcome that the Bill will ensure CCTV authorisations by the Garda Commissioner are issued to local authorities rather than individuals or groups.  We also welcome the requirement that the local authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are to be joint controllers for community CCTV systems.  We also welcome the provisions throughout the Bill on various compulsory codes of practice.  Such codes will be necessary to satisfy fully the requirements of the law enforcement directive as well as the standards of clarity, precision and foreseeability in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p> While noting that codes may be laid before the Oireachtas, we recommend, as the Policing Authority has referenced, that consideration should be given to the means by which the codes can be more widely published.  We further recommend that a public consultation should occur before the making or updating of such codes.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for giving of their time.  I am very happy to any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, thanks the committee for this opportunity to participate here today.  I am joined by our executive director, Mr. Liam Herrick, and we are both happy to answer questions.  In this statement I will summarise our key concerns with the Bill, as outlined in more detail in our written submission.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL welcomes the inclusion of requirements to carry out data protection and human rights impact assessments as well as the requirements to consult the Data Protection Commission and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission ahead of the creation of codes of practice.  We note the inclusion of some requirements for consideration of necessity and proportionality for authorising surveillance, which we also welcome.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL recognises that digital technology may offer a valuable tool in the detection of crime.  However, it considers this Bill will vastly expand the surveillance powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without sufficient evidence these developments are necessary in the Irish context, proportionate to the risk they pose to a range of rights, or that there are sufficient data protection safeguards.  The ICCL also questions the proposed expansion of surveillance powers while, as we understand it, there are ongoing inquiries by the Data Protection Commission into the compliance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with data protection law.  We note the deeply concerning findings last June while recognising what the representative from the Data Protection Commission has just said in terms of welcoming aspects of the Bill.  We note the deeply concerning findings last year that indicated a generalised failure by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to comply with data protection law.  It is in that context the ICCL would call on the Government to pause any proposal to expand Garda surveillance powers until such time as there are satisfactory, proper and sufficient policies and practices to ensure data protection law is being complied with.<\/p> <p>  We have previously expressed our opposition to the introduction of body-worn cameras for garda&iacute; given the risks to privacy and data protection and, in our view, the glaring absence of conclusive evidence from other jurisdictions that they contribute positively to policing or justice outcomes.  We call on the Government to abandon plans to introduce body-worn cameras or, alternatively, we call for more research to demonstrate they are necessary in Ireland, including through the introduction of a pilot programme before a general roll-out of them.<\/p> <p>  The Bill proposes a significant expansion in the use of CCTV by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by providing access to real-time live feed from non-Garda or third party CCTV cameras.  We have identified some serious and ongoing risks with the use of CCTV and we call for more research into the effectiveness of CCTV in both preventing and detecting crime before Garda access is expanded.<\/p> <p>  We also call for greater safeguards around the use of drones given their increased risk to privacy and transparency.  We question whether sufficient safeguards are in place for the proposed expanded use of automatic number plate recognition technology.<\/p> <p>  In our written submission we have made 22 specific recommendations on how we believe the Bill can be strengthened.  Those include the following five key issues.  The lawful purpose assigned to the use of recording devices is too broad and may lend itself to an overuse of such devices.  The definition of what constitutes a recording device is vague and may pave the way for the introduction of new technologies such as facial recognition technology without sufficient debate, research or a demonstration of their necessity in the Irish context.  We note that facial recognition technology has renowned ethnic, racial and gender biases and has enabled mass surveillance and discriminatory targeted surveillance elsewhere.  We also consider there are important distinctions in law between the thresholds and safeguards which must apply to both covert and overt surveillance.  We consider the requirement of visibility of recording devices for overt surveillance is not sufficiently addressed in the Bill and provisions on covert surveillance would appear not to be accompanied by sufficient safeguards.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is also not clear regarding who has the authorisation to install, use and access recording devices.  We note the DPC's concerns, outlined in its report last year, that there has been excessive access to monitoring stations within Garda stations.  We call for greater transparency on this issue and accountability where policies and protocols are not followed.  While recognising the provision that a recording device itself does not have to be produced in court is practical and therefore welcome, we call for the provision at head 20(A)(3) on the admissibility of evidence to be removed.  In our view such decisions should remain strictly with the courts.  The apparent proposal to exclude garda&iacute; from criminal liability under the legislation should be removed or it should be made clearer that garda&iacute; can be held criminally liable if they commit any of the offences that are created by this Bill, including the offence of tampering with recording devices.<\/p> <p>  Digital surveillance presents a direct interference with the right to privacy and impacts a range of other rights.  We urge the Government to pause any expansion of Garda surveillance powers at a time when there are clear findings that existing powers have been misused.  We call for any revision of surveillance powers to be accompanied by robust safeguards, including adequate oversight, to ensure our rights are always protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Doireann Ansbro"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for providing us with this opportunity to meet them and make a submission.  I want to take just ten seconds to point out we were somewhat surprised and even astounded we were not given the same opportunity when the general scheme on policing, security and community safety Bill was released.<\/p><p>As we represent almost 100% of the 11,800 rank-and-file and front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we believe it might have been an oversight on the part of the committee to not include us as a stakeholder.  We ask the committee to reflect on that.<\/p><p> On the GRA's position, the availability of body-worn cameras has the potential to enhance the safety of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and protect them against malicious and vexatious complaints and from that point of view, this development is very welcome.  Body-worn cameras also have the potential to gather better evidence to assist in the prosecution and, ultimately, the conviction of offenders.  If we look at the context, the increasing level of assaults against garda&iacute; is well documented and in 2020, almost 1,000 of our members were assaulted in the course of their duty.  Garda&iacute;, like many other victims of crime, often express frustration that the penalties imposed on assailants are unduly lenient and do not reflect the severity of the attack.  Body cameras allow a judge and jury to relive the experience of the assaulted officer from a very unique viewpoint.  The camera, after all, does not lie, as long as the chain of evidence is properly processed and protected.<\/p><p> Our Garda members approach the debate around body-worn cameras from the perspective of protecting themselves and their colleagues.  However, the benefits also extend to the victims of crimes that our Garda members investigate.  As first responders, garda&iacute; are often present at crime scenes in the immediate aftermath.  The appropriate use of camera technology provides an impartial and clinical recollection of crime scenes, road traffic collisions and comments made by both the victims and the suspects.<\/p><p> While the body-worn cameras are welcomed, the current draft of the Bill may cause confusion and fear among garda&iacute; because there is a suggestion that we may be subject to both civil and criminal liability and prosecution.  If it is directed that members wear body-worn cameras in accordance with an agreed protocol and procedure, with appropriate and essential training, a garda should not be at risk of private or civil actions.  In this age of data protection and personal privacy, garda&iacute; cannot be held personally liable in any such actions for invasion of privacy or breach of data protection while carrying out their duties, and any such actions must be indemnified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip McAnenly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McAnely.

This is an important Bill.  It brings together a number of areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na either currently records the activities of the general public or where it intends to do so in the future using up-to-date recording technologies.  It is important that we get this right and that we provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a robust, modern statute that is fit for purpose.  Work commenced on this Bill when the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland reported on and supported the deployment of body-worn cameras.  It seemed like an ideal opportunity to not only legislate for that but to update the law in a number of areas where recordings are made for law enforcement purposes.<\/p> <p>  Some people will have concerns about the Bill, some of which have been raised already, but there is no reason to be concerned.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention that this will be a strong and effective piece of legislation that will provide the Garda with additional powers, but will also contain considerable safeguards and protections for the citizen.  In drafting the general scheme, the Minister has considered the invasion of privacy that is involved in recording.  The Constitution protects people's right to privacy.  Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights states, \"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\"  However, this right is not absolute.  Police authorities may not infringe on this right unless it is done in accordance with the law, is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or for the prevention of disorder or crime.  Therefore, activities that restrict our privacy rights must be prescribed by law, must be necessary to achieve a legitimate aim and must be proportionate to the aim being pursued.  Throughout the general scheme one will see the powers that are being given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the purpose of the recording and a stipulation that the recording must be necessary and proportionate.<\/p> <p>  We have placed considerable emphasis on the establishment of codes of practice by the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with stakeholders, regarding parts 2 and 3 of the Bill.  In preparing the codes of practice, the Commissioner must ensure that a data protection impact assessment and a human rights impact assessment are carried out.  The Commissioner must consult various bodies such as the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and may consult other bodies appearing to have an interest in the matter.  The bodies mentioned have all been consulted on the drafting of the general scheme.  The final version of the code of practice will be submitted to the Minister to be included in a statutory instrument and laid before the Houses.  <\/p> <p>  I will not go into the details of the Bill as all members have had a good look at those already.  I will just say that it is our intention, and the Minister's, that this Bill will fully comply with international human rights instruments and with data protection law.  There are requirements for review on a regular basis to ensure that each provision is operating as we would expect.  In terms of oversight, the ultimate oversight will be provided by the courts in deciding if the recording has been obtained legally and is admissible as evidence.  In head 21, we have included temporary provisions for a designated judge to keep the operation of parts 4 and 5 of the Act under review.  It is our intention to replace this provision with the arrangements for an independent examiner of security, which will be provided for in the policing, security and community safety Bill.  Whichever provision is ultimately included will depend on the progress of each Bill through the Houses.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee.  My colleague and I are happy to take questions and will try to address any concerns raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Woods.

I will try to address that.  The Deputy has outlined the benefits and those are exactly the circumstances where we feel our members could rely on and present better evidence.

This will give confidence to those people who have doubts about how garda&iacute; conduct their duties, and particularly in communities where relations can be improved and where there may be a perceived mistrust among some parties.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked when the cameras would be switched on.  Obviously, again we come back to the protocol.  We must be mindful of citizens' right to privacy and when it is appropriate to record.  Generally, we would probably expect to see this being used in situations that are confrontational.  A tourist approaching a garda on O'Connell Street looking for directions is not going to want to have his or her image or audio recorded.  That would be inappropriate.  There are other such circumstances, for example, with a victim of sexual assault or a person seeking advice from a garda on a personal issue.  It would not be appropriate to record those interactions.  This is where we will find guidance in the protocol.  These systems are tried and tested in other jurisdictions and hopefully the protocol will reflect what has been learned.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to gathering evidence at crime scenes.  One of the big success stories from the perspective of victims is in relation to domestic violence.  We are all well versed that there has been an increase in domestic violence.  I believe it is more likely for a person to be a victim of homicide in domestic circumstances than in any other circumstances.  This seems to be the case across the world.  In our experience, one could go to the same location time after time and witness a vulnerable person being the victim of an assault or violence on repeated occasions and never having the confidence to make that statement to outline what happened, or where perhaps making the statement can revisit the trauma.  When a police officer is on the scene who has a recording of the trauma and how the person was reacting, it can gather the aggression and the attitude of the offender or suspect.<\/p><p>It creates an excellent piece of evidence and allows a jury or a judge to see what the victim was subjected to.  The benefits are huge for victims of crime and also in terms of efficiencies within the criminal justice system.  There has been an emphasis and focus within the organisation on training so that we can provide a more effective response to domestic violence.  This is a key part of that strategy and we would see it as bringing huge benefits for victims, particularly victims of domestic violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I agree there is a huge opportunity there because, as Mr. O'Connor has said, it can be such a difficult thing to get a report and to be able to gather evidence.

The organisation has the capacity to use it for a specified purpose but there are issues around the protocol, how that is put together, the consultation involved, how often it is reviewed and by whom.  These issues are important both in terms of the protection of privacy and also of efficacy.  When the camera is switched on is important and that is about the judgment of the individual member.

We do not yet have the detail as to what will be defined as evidence but we cannot have a situation where the data gathered from these cameras is kept forever.  I do not think anybody intends that to be the case, notwithstanding the points that were made earlier about it making sense to keep certain data for long periods but what provision is there in that regard?

The destruction of data that no longer serves a purpose or cannot be retained any longer due to the statutory codes that will be put in place is a different matter.  I understand the length of time for which the data will be retained will be dictated by the data protection impact assessment.  For example, if an incident is flagged for which no criminal charge is made, but subsequently a criminal charge is made, obviously one would need the provision to retain that data until such time as criminal proceedings are finalised.

This is an essential and important question, and the Senator is correct in raising it: how long will data be retained for?  That will have to worked out.  The Bill in its current form provides a statutory obligation, which exists under data protection law anyway regardless of the Act.  However, it is further emphasised and provided for in the Bill in that those issues must be assessed thoroughly.  In meeting the requirements under data protection law - as I highlighted in my opening comments and submission - this Bill together with the codes of conduct go toward satisfying the requirements of the law enforcement directive and requirements under EU law.  The Bill in itself does not do that.  It will require the development of those codes and the layout of those codes, in a statutory sense, before the Oireachtas to satisfy the requirements of data protection law.

I believe the general public has an interest in this matter.  Will there be any scope during drafting to include a requirement for public consultation?  I have another question which may be that of a new Deputy.  Head 7(5) states: \"Where the Minister receives a draft code of practice ... he or she may by order declare that the code, scheduled to the order, shall be a code of practice.\"  I ask that clarity be provided on how much scope the Minister will have to vary or change what he or she receives at that point in time.   I have a couple of other questions for the Department around drafting issues.  I will run through some points and then come back in.<\/p> <p>  Head 15 deals with temporary approval for access to third-party CCTV.  Several of the heads before head 15 deal with the issue of an application by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to adjudge for authorisation, in the same manner that is done for a search warrant.  However, there is no urgency test in the temporary approval as is required under Criminal Justice (Search Warrants) Act 2012.  If there are circumstances where judicial approval is not practical, we need to state that there is an urgency in those situations.  The lack of an urgency test is concerning, and I ask that it is addressed in drafting.  The period allowed under the Bill is 72 hours which, again, speaks to a lack of urgency.  If 72 hours of recording is allowed, that strikes me as something that should - as contained in the previous heads - go before a judge for independent judicial assessment and authorisation.<\/p> <p>  Head 9 states how CCTV will be operated on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Will witnesses provide clarity on who they envisage will operate that?  I am conscious that the definition of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, under head 2, includes civilian Garda staff.  If we outsource the monitoring of CCTV to persons outside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we will lose some of the transparency and oversight of protocols, rules and training that currently exist in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and which give security to those activities.<\/p> <p>  Under head 8, no difference is made between overt surveillance and covert surveillance.  Will that be addressed?  There is a lot of talk about the need for recording equipment to be identified.  Obviously, there are cases where a crime is being investigated and the last thing one wants is a giant sign that reads \"there is a recording device here\".  From my perspective, we are getting into an area - covert surveillance - in which we need to balance rights.  Should we be seeking warrants for covert surveillance?  Is there an intention to address the difference between overt and covert surveillance?  I will leave my questions at that for now.

That is certainly something which can be taken into account.<\/p> <p>  On head 7(5) and the Minister's role in approving the codes of practice under Part 2, the Minister is a person to be consulted in regard to the preparation of the codes.  The idea is that the Minister and other bodies will already have been consulted and given the opportunity to express their views as to how the code should be structured and what detail should go into it.  Ultimately, the Minister will have the discretion not to sign such an order should he or she believe it would not be appropriate.

I refer to CCTV and other parties who may make an application to the Garda Commissioner.  These provisions are modelled on what is provided for under section 38 of the Garda Act.

On the recording of the devices on Garda body cams, will an independent record be kept of the time the recording commenced and when it stopped?  Following on from some of the comments made by the Policing Authority about the access to the footage, does the Department anticipate that a person who has had an altercation or interaction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be allowed to have access to the recording immediately or prior to a court charge?  In the normal course of events an application will be made to the judge and the judge will allow access to the information.

The codes of practice will be complied with using the types of technological devices that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has access to, when it is in a position to roll them out, etc.  The code of practice will have to be developed and agreed prior to the roll-out of body-worn cameras but, as it stands, it is not clear when exactly that will be.<\/p> <p>  On access to footage, I imagine that data held by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is subject to the same rights of access requests, etc., that can be made under data protection law.

I always struggle not to see something like this through the lens of social class.  Senator Ward asked about the intentions of technological profiling.  With all the best intentions, we can say that that is not the purpose of this legislation.  However, class bias is already built into technologies and into algorithms before we even put the CCTV cameras up for their intended use.  How do we safeguard people from working class communities who will probably be disproportionately affected by the use of cameras in their community?<\/p> <p>  This legislation talks about prevention of crime.  I do not think that anyone should be under the illusion that this would prevent crime.  In particular in the places where there will be calls to put CCTV, the crime will just move to another location.  This is about the detection of crime.  My concern is that if we look for crime in particular places, we are going to find it.  The most important thing for me will be how the decisions will made about where we look.  Whatever about the technology not being set out to profile people, the decisions are already set to profile people.  This is because decisions will be made geographically, by socioeconomic class, and about particular communities where there is a high amount of deprivation that results in a particular amount of criminality at whatever level.  The profiling will have, therefore, already happened before the CCTV camera even goes in.  This is what makes me nervous.<\/p> <p>  From the point of view of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, how do we ensure that we can protect people from being disproportionately impacted by the use of technology in terms of their civil liberties, their race, their class and everything else that is already built into technology that we have not even procured but for which will have legislation?  We do not really have an understanding of what has been built into the technology that we will procure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#J00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>It is important that consideration should be given to future technologies, as well as to facial recognition technology, given the potential impact on minority communities and the potential for discrimination.  We have already seen through research in other jurisdictions that using facial recognition technology has a negative and disproportionate impact on people of colour and on women.  This is because of misidentification, as well as because of biases that are built into, as the Senator said, the algorithms in that the unconscious biases of the developers are often reflected within the development of this software.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how to protect people, it is important to note that the EU in the proposed regulation on artificial intelligence has suggested that facial recognition technology should never be used in a public place.  We need to be cognisant of that.  I would highlight that this is contrary to what is in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na modernisation plan 2016-2021, which states that it plans to use facial recognition technology to track suspects from CCTV, as well as to use technologies such as face-in-the-crowd and shape-in-the-crowd biometrics.  We would be highly concerned about any use or potential use of facial recognition technology.  We need to specify that that will not be used in the Irish context.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that the current Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na code of practice states that automatic facial recognition technologies are prohibited.  In our opposition to body-worn cameras, we have also noted concerns in other jurisdictions, where they have been more used in communities that are already over-policed.  This is having an impact on trust and on community policing between the people who are policed and the police themselves.  It also potentially impacts on garda discretion itself, where a garda is able to use his or her discretion on whether or not something is pursued.  There are a lot of ramifications and this is why we are calling for more research and for a pilot project before there is a general roll-out.  There are a lot of ramifications that we need to consider before such software is rolled out.<\/p> <p>  One other point is about this idea that potentially new software can be included in this legislation.  I understand the rationale is that safeguards should be applied to any future technology.  However, we need to be cognisant that the rapid development of technology and software at the moment poses new and unforeseen risks to rights.  That is why we say that future technology should be assessed individually, on a case-by-case basis, to make sure that the impact on rights is not disproportionate.  A dangerous part of this legislation is that new software is potentially envisioned to be covered by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Doireann Ansbro"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I will move on to the next speaker.

I have a question that is probably more for the Department to respond.  Maybe the Garda representatives will also have a view.  Not that long ago, the Department rolled out the CCTV community scheme.  I worked with my local community scheming to try to get that scheme up and running.  It was for CCTV cameras around our towns and villages to combat crime and to have this type of evidence.  However, there was huge difficulty in terms of the data storage, data protection and data retention.  At the time, after lots of toing and froing, I realised that the onus for that data protection and data storage lay firmly with local authorities.  In my experience, local authorities were not willing to take on that role.<\/p> <p>  In this particular Bill, which is about digital recording, has that been given any consideration?  This has an important role to play in crime prevention and in the gathering of evidence.  It could be an opportunity.  I would like the Department&rsquo;s view.  My experience is that communities probably missed out a lot on that scheme, because there was much resistance from local authorities to take on that role.  I think that is understandable.  My view is that role should not be with the local authorities.  They are nowhere near geared for data protection, retention or storage.  It would be much more suitable for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be responsible for that element of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#J00500","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>There have been some changes made to the CCTV provisions under this proposed legislation that will make significant changes for community groups from what is currently provided under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.

We had the same issues.  Around the country there were some very good quality cameras in place.  We were using them to investigate crime.  However, issues arose, as the Deputy highlighted, in relation to who the data controller was.  In my own division in Letterkenny, we had a problem where there is a CCTV system that is quite similar to that which operates in Dublin city centre.  Yet, unlike in Dublin, the county council in Donegal was the data controller, even though garda&iacute; in the communications room were actually controlling the joystick.<\/p><p>There are, therefore, huge logistical issues.

That kind of context is missing from head 9.  Head 9 could apply to the use of drones and be about enabling them.  Essentially, we are missing a safeguard that is in a previous head with regard to the use of drones.  That is particularly important in the context of whether the garda&iacute; should need a warrant with regard to the use of drones in monitoring somebody's private house.  I would like to see that discrepancy addressed.  Will it be possible to address that discrepancy in the future drafting?<\/p><p>One of the other issues then is with regard to head 18.  When read in the context of the definitions in the interpretation in head 2, the &quot;relevant data&quot; seem to be relegated to &quot;Automatic Number Plate Recognition&quot;.  If that is what it is about, why not say that?  The reading of head 18 as it stands now, without that context from head 2, seems to be very concerning.  It seems to give <i>carte blanche<\/i>in terms of investigatory powers and demanding data.  It would be a watering down of many of the protections and requirements for getting a warrant or judicial warrant with regard to phone or bank records or things like that.  As I said, the way it is drafted means it is about the relevant data under head 2, which are defined simply as &quot;Automatic Number Plate Recognition&quot;.  I do not understand why head 18 is drawn so broad for one small piece of data.  Again, that is part of my theme about unnecessary broadness and a concern around lack of safeguards.<\/p><p>They are the issues I would like to see addressed along with head 15 in relation to a lack of urgency test and an unnecessarily long period of 72 hours.  I appreciate there are times when evidence may be destroyed when there is a need to act quickly from the garda&iacute;.  As I said, however, if we compare that to other legislation around warrants and searches, there is an urgency test as well as the idea of  independence and the rank of superintendent or higher, which is entirely missing from head 15.

It would appear that there is quite a journey to go yet with regard to this particular legislation.<\/p> <p>  First, I will make a comment on CCTV.  I respectfully suggest that any community watching the debate this afternoon is probably doing so aghast when it comes to the installation of CCTV in towns throughout the length and breadth of the country.  My experience is that the process is very cumbersome and time-consuming.  I am aware of a couple of examples in my part of the world where applications for CCTV seem to go on for an eternity.  I do not know whether that particular issue can be addressed by this legislation.<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome CCTV.  I believe it acts in the prevention as well as the investigation of crime.  I know of many incidents where positive outcomes have resulted from it.  I am, therefore, very much a fan of CCTV.  Having said that, it is important we balance that with citizens' rights and we must also be very cognisant of victims of crime when we discuss matters like this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the body cameras, a number of speakers have alluded to the rapid development of technologies.  That is very true and it is a question of how legislation keeps up with that rapid development of technology.  It is a challenge and it is important.

That was mentioned by another contributor.  The Bill will set out the basic requirements for visibility and a visible indicator when it is turned on.  The codes can then set additional standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve-Anne Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>What are the thoughts of garda&iacute; on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#L00700","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632178800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>We would like to make a few points in this regard.  In our submission we alluded to the failure to consult with us on the code of practice.  This part of the discussion reinforces the absolute importance of involving the Garda staff associations in the consultation process for development of the code of practice required.  It is something I ask Ms Kenny to take on board.<\/p> <p>  On our experience of international colleagues and police forces, I did not get an opportunity to come back to Senator Ruane's comments.  The evidence that we are aware of is that the use of body-worn cameras has a very positive effect in many cases on crime prevention and the behaviour of the participants or persons involved in an interaction that may escalate and get out of control.  Oftentimes, the use of a body-worn camera can be preventative in that respect.<\/p> <p>  I also do not accept that crime is not preventable and crime simply moves on.  Were that to be the case our members would be demotivated working in the areas they are working in.  We would argue that crime is very much preventable and our members are doing a tremendous job in preventing crime.  I understand that is the point that is being made. <\/p> <p>  We cannot get away from the fact there is a requirement to ensure there is proper training for our members should the Bill be concluded.  It is important that there should be appropriate and proper training for our members, not only in the use of the equipment but also updating our members on the rights of citizens to privacy and issues around that.

I welcome these provisions.  It is a good idea to put this into the realm of the State.  That protects everybody involved.  Community organisations in my area have a great fear of transgressing the protocols, in particular GDPR, and other data protection laws.  It is something they worry about.<\/p> <p>  However, while CCTV has a role to play, I have a great fear of the Big Brother aspect.  I worry about the notion of CCTV.  I recognise what the GRA said about it being a tool rather than a primary source of crime prevention, but I worry about it.  In our nearest jurisdiction, the UK, it is used to an extraordinary extent.  It is oppressive on the population there.  <\/p> <p>  Who will prevent that from happening?  Whose role is it to ensure that we do not have a proliferation of CCTV that will create all kinds of problems and infringe on people's rights to privacy?  How will it operate between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities?  Who is the ultimate arbiter?  For example, if a local authority does not want to co-operate, would that create problems?  If a community wants to run a scheme that objectively makes sense but there is not buy-in from the local authority, does that mean it cannot go ahead?  By the same token, if there is not buy-in from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, does that prevent the scheme from going ahead?

I will come in anyway.<\/p> <p>  In essence, on the first question on CCTV and the idea that we will have an excess of cameras or far more cameras than are necessary, the requirements in the Bill in terms of authorisation by the Garda Commissioner are that a data protection impact assessment is carried out prior to the installation of any CCTV.  Any alterations to existing CCTV schemes where that would extend their coverage or number of cameras would be subject to another authorisation.  The old authorisation cannot be relied on; a separate application has to be made. <\/p> <p>  There will be codes of practice governing CCTV as well as the other technologies under in the Bill, which will require consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and data protection and human rights impact assessments.  From our point of view, we feel there are safeguards in the Bill to prevent the type of situation to which the Senator referred.<\/p> <p>  On the new roll-out of community CCTV, as I mentioned, the Minister has committed to undertake a review of how communities can continue to play a role in CCTV and how the proposals under the Bill will take effect over the next couple of years.  We will have to await the outcome of that review to make further comment on that point.  The key thing to note is that the local authority and Garda Commissioner will be required under the Bill to enter into a joint data control agreement.  It would be very clear what their rights and responsibilities are in respect of the data from CCTV.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#L01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve-Anne Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I might move on as time is tight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021092100002#M00100","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1632178800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I have one question for the GRA and one for Mr. Collins.

The community I represent has a very strong view that it would like to be supported by effective and enhanced policing.  How do we assess that or track and monitor it so that we can reduce the concern or at least provide data regarding it?<\/p> <p>  Garda members should be inherently involved in the design of the programme, which should be overseen by external bodies because they are the people who will be implementing it and their view is essential.  Have many of them expressed concern or is there overwhelming support for the programme?  I am not sure if we have achieved that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Collins a question given his oversight position.  It is clear there have been a lot of questions on policing, and policing by consent has come up to a great extent in the past year with Covid.

We feel that nearly every community is underpoliced.  This will bring a level of transparency.  On the fears and suspicions that exist, we feel this will address any doubts because the interactions of garda&iacute; with any community will be there to be scrutinised by relevant oversight bodies and supervision within the organisation.  If improper or poor practice exists, it would help eradicate it, but we contend it is not at the level suggested by some.

Over the period of the health emergency in the past 18 months, the authority has been monitoring and overseeing very carefully the exercise by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the additional powers that were given to them.  In the 15 reports the authority submitted to the Minister, the overwhelming response from the public has been very positive on the approach of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A great deal of that derived from the fact there was a new tone and a new approach being deployed and displayed by garda&iacute;.  There was more empathy, respect and human engagement, if I could use that term, without in any sense diminishing the work of the garda&iacute; involved.  That is an important lesson to be learned from that period.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt the experiences of some who engaged with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are less positive than that, and some of those unhappy experiences have perhaps been intensified during the course of the pandemic.  There are also lessons in that on the way in which people and communities are approached.  Some communities have a history of poor engagement with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and responsibility for that rests probably somewhere between both.  There is a challenge to be met by the Garda, as there is a challenge for those communities and those who work with them, to find new ways of engagement.<\/p> <p>  To reiterate a point I made earlier, the codes of practice in this Bill are of critical importance.
