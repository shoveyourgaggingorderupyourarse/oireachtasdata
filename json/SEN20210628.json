She has pressing matters to deal with so I thank her for taking my Commencement matter.  She is probably as shocked as me at the revelations from the internal Garda investigation into the cancellation of domestic violence 999 calls.  When I got wind of it, I got really upset because I sit on the joint policing committee in Clare and we have seen domestic violence figures greatly increase during the Covid pandemic.  We all know that existing supports badly need extra infrastructure and funding.  According to the internal investigation, calls are being treated with a lack of empathy or are not being responded to.  Calls that are responded to are not properly documented or followed up on and the cancellations have had an effect on the collection of important data and statistics on domestic violence, which is a huge issue on every level of our society.  Some 3,120 domestic violence calls were marked as cancelled.  There were valid reasons for cancelling one third of those, but that was not the case with the other two thirds.  It is just not good enough.<\/p> <p>We need to look at why this happened in the first place and what is needed to ensure that it does not happen again.  Are additional resources needed?  Do members of the Garda need extra training so they know how to show empathy?  A person in a domestic violence situation is very disempowered because he or she has put up with it in the first place.  It takes a lot of courage to pick up the phone to lodge a complaint.  Often, that happens at the very tail end of a long history of emotional and physical violence.  Much mental anguish, disempowerment and lack of self-value comes with domestic abuse, so when someone is making that call the last thing he or she needs is somebody who is flippant, does not show empathy or does not follow up.  It is great the Garda held the internal investigation but it has highlighted some serious issues.  Those issues need to be rectified.  I hope the Minister of State can answer some of the questions that have arisen.  What do we need to do about this issue and about the greater issue of increasing levels of domestic violence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#A00400","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Garvey for raising this important issue.

I am particularly concerned that anyone experiencing domestic abuse or whose personal safety was otherwise at risk and who sought assistance via a 999 call may not have received it.  The Senator will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has publicly apologised for this, and was correct to do so.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fell short of the high standards the public expects of the Garda.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, that when someone calls 999 now, he or she can expect and trust that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will help.  This must always be the case.  I can confirm that the Garda Commissioner has put new processes in place, strengthening supervision and providing training to ensure this never happens again.  I welcome these steps.<\/p><p>As the Senator is aware, this issue was initially identified in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last October as part of its internal processes.  The Department was informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in December that it had commenced an internal examination of the cancellation of 999 calls.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the Policing Authority.  Following discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, requested the Policing Authority to oversee the investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in February this year, and there has been ongoing engagement on this issue between the authority and the Garda Commissioner at both their public and private meetings.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has been briefed by the Garda Commissioner and the authority chairman, Mr. Bob Collins, on the progress of the ongoing internal investigation over the past number of weeks.  The importance of having independent, robust policing oversight to respond constructively to public policing service concerns such as this is evident, and the authority will provide a report to me when its consideration of this matter is concluded.<\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner has also confirmed that garda&iacute; are now contacting people whose 999 calls were cancelled to apologise and to ask if they require help from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is vital that the best interests of victims of domestic abuse and those of anyone else whose calls were cancelled inappropriately are the priority focus throughout this process.  I will continue to remain in close contact with the Garda Commissioner and the chair of the authority over the coming weeks on this matter.  On the conclusion of their investigations, the Garda and the authority will make recommendations and take appropriate actions to ensure that this vital emergency service responds in a consistent, compassionate and timely way to those who call upon it in times of danger and vulnerability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#A00500","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

Operation Faoiseamh has resulted in a 24% increase in criminal charges brought against perpetrators of domestic violence in 2020 versus 2019.

It is unique to have a Senator responding to Commencement matters.<\/p> <p>At the outset, I acknowledge the recent announcement of &euro;3.1 million for Dunmore East Harbour and other marine amenities in Waterford, including piers at Helvick, Tramore, Cheekpoint, Ballinacourty and the slipway at Bunmahon.  This level of investment in our marine amenities is greatly welcome and the coastal communities across Waterford will benefit massively from it.<\/p> <p>I will proceed to the main premise of my Commencement matter, which is the designation of Dunmore East as an official landing port for UK-registered fishing vessels post Brexit.  Following Britain leaving the European Union, only two fishing ports were designated for landings, but last January five ports were added to the list.  However, there is no designated landing port from Howth in Dublin to Castletownbere in Cork for UK-registered fishing vessels .  This leaves the entire south east coastline without a designated port, which is an anomaly that must be addressed without delay.<\/p> <p>This is a matter which I and my Waterford Government colleagues, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, and Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh have taken up directly with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and he is on record as saying that this will be kept under review.  While I appreciate that technical and regulatory protocols must be put in place to ensure that third country fishing vessels properly count and document what is landed at Irish ports, I believe this can easily be done as there are fisheries protection officers and facilities already in place at Dunmore East Harbour.  I understand that there were only 24 landings over the 2018 and 2019 period but this amounted to 318 tonnes of fish, which had a positive impact on the port and secondary processors in the area.<\/p> <p>Given the clear geographic gap between Howth and Castletownbere that I mentioned, I believe Dunmore East would become a popular location for UK-registered fishing vessels to land their catches.  One must also consider the environmental impact of fishermen travelling from the south east to Howth and Castletownbere to offload their catches.  The strategic location of Dunmore East cannot and should not be ignored.  There is no question that opportunities are created and expanded by every fishing vessel that lands at a harbour.  I implore the Minister of State to convey what I have said to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and to ask for urgent action on this matter.<\/p> <p>Before I conclude, I will briefly mention the farcical situation that now exists at Irish ports across the State following the decision of the European Commission to remove the derogation that existed heretofore on the weighing of fish at factories, due to a three-year-old report which stated that manipulation of the weighing system was taking place.  This is a very serious matter which has far-reaching consequences for the fishing sector and calls into question the integrity of every fisherman.  That is unacceptable.  To my knowledge, no evidence of this practice has been provided, yet the entire industry will suffer as a result.  Asking fishermen to take fish out of ice boxes to weigh them at harbour walls in what can often be warm temperatures is nonsensical and will have an impact on costs, time and the freshness of fish.  I ask that this is taken up directly with the Commission and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, and that the appropriate reassurances are given to them to reinstate this derogation without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#B00700","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Cummins for bringing this matter to our attention.

Dunmore East was not designated at this point as there has been a low number of landings by these vessels in the past two to three years.<br\/><br\/>To elaborate, in 2018, there were 15 landings by UK-registered Northern Ireland vessels into Dunmore East.  This reduced to nine landings in 2019 and reduced again further in 2020.  Over 2018 and 2019, the total volume of landings into Dunmore East by these vessels amounted to 318 tonnes, as Senator Cummins indicated.  The Minister understands that these were landings of nephrops, mainly from the Smalls fishing grounds off the south-east coast.  The Minister included Howth as a designated port at the beginning of the year because there were 26 landings by UK-registered vessels into Howth in 2018, increasing to 28 landings in 2019.  In comparison with Dunmore East, over 2018 and 2019, the total volume of landings into Howth by UK-registered vessels amounted to almost 1,050 tonnes, over three times the volume of landings into Dunmore East.  The designation of Howth provides a landing option for UK-registered Northern Ireland vessels fishing for nephrops in the large fishing grounds in the north Irish Sea and may also provide an option for vessels fishing in the Smalls or Labidine fishing grounds.<br\/><br\/>The Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, SFPA, has already undertaken significant work in putting in place the arrangements necessary to provide for the five additional port designations.  As the Minister has previously stated in the D&aacute;il, there are significant practical and cost implications for the State in the designation of EU ports for third country landings as, under EU regulations, such designations represent an entry point to the European Union, following which food is free to circulate within the full EU Common Market.  On this basis, for any ports designated, Ireland is obliged to ensure that it has in place a meaningful control presence.  I assure Senator Cummins that the designation of ports for landings does not preclude vessels from coming into ports for <i>force majeure<\/i>reasons such as the need to reach a safe harbour.<br\/><br\/>When the Minister made the designations in January, this was done in immediate response to the Brexit situation and in consideration of the various pressures on the SFPA, as well as the various landing patterns in different ports.  The Minister is fully aware that Dunmore East's location is strategically appropriate for any additional designation and that there is SFPA infrastructure and offices in the port.  He will consider these and all other factors during any future review of the designation of additional ports.  Finally, I assure Senator Cummins that the Minister will continue to engage with stakeholders on all issues, including designation of ports, relating to the fishing sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#B00800","speaker":"1661","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

As the Minister of State well knows, it is not only us but many Irish beekeepers, bee enthusiasts and those of us who care deeply about our native biodiversity.  I have spoken to the wonderful Martin O'Rourke from the County Louth Beekeepers Association which was established in 1910 and has more than a century of collected knowledge on how best to protect native bee stocks, biodiversity and what is in the best interests of our island's natural and native environment.  We should listen to the people who know their bees.<\/p> <p>It is time for some true ecological nationalism.  A growing body of scientific research is proving what beekeepers have known for generations.  A Limerick Institute of Technology scientist has proven beyond any doubt that the pure native Irish honey bee is not extinct as previously feared, but still exists on the island of Ireland.  An applied science postgraduate student, Jack Hassett, has discovered that millions of the pure native species are living in at least 300 hives throughout the country.  His study shows that while the black bee should be considered endangered, there are enough of the pure native honeybee in Ireland to not only ensure its survival with the proper support, but also enough Irish bees to repopulate northern Europe, where the majority of Apis mellifera mellifera has died out or been hybridised.  It is too late to act once the horse has bolted.  It is time for action.<\/p> <p>I would be grateful if the Minister of State could provide an update on studies undertaken with the aid of the genetic research grant she spoke about previously.

They want action not words.  This is not a criticism of the EU, because the EU has the mechanism and the provisions under Article 36 to take measures which, in essence, would have the effect of restricting and prohibiting the importation of non-native honey bees to Ireland.<\/p> <p>The EU has in its treaty the precautionary principle, which allows for a higher level of environmental protection through preventive decision taking in the case of risk.  There is the well-established habitats directive and there is significant regulation dealing with the prevention and spread of alien species.  This is not new.  This was challenged in the court about 20 years ago.  The Danish decision to prohibit the importation of non-native honey bees was upheld.  They wanted to retain the brown bee.  The decision stated there was a high threshold and it must be justified and proportionate.

As they both know, I fully acknowledge the important contribution bees make not only to agriculture and biodiversity but also as an important activity for people.  Indeed, beekeepers are very passionate about what they do.  In this regard, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations.  These supports include funding to carry out applied research through the national apiculture programme, grants to national beekeeping associations and grant aid to fund capital investments for beekeepers.  The Department is also a partner in the all-Ireland pollinator plan, which will run until 2025.  The Department is supporting a farmland pollinator officer and a successful European innovation partnership project running in County Kildare.  The Department is a member of the all-Ireland honeybee strategy steering group so we are very much fully aware of the concerns that exist.  We have, as Senator McGreehan outlined, funded a number of studies under the genetic research grant aid scheme looking at various aspects of this honeybee species and specifically apis mellifera mellifera.  In 2021, funding has been allocated for an innovative queen rearing project.  The Department also supports the work of the Native Irish Honey Bee Society, NIHBS.<\/p> <p>The importation of honeybees into Ireland is facilitated under regulations governing intra-community trade with other EU member states.  The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Regulation 2016\/429.  All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export.  The reason for this is to ensure that imported bees are healthy and do not harbour pathogens or parasites that may be harmful to our native bee stock.  The health certificate also outlines the import restrictions that apply on regions that have confirmed cases of the small hive beetle.  It is therefore very much built around protecting our own bee species from disease and ill health rather than safeguarding the genetic strength.<\/p> <p>Regarding the protection of the native Irish honeybee, I recently met with the NIHBS.  I thank Senator Martin for organising that.  Following this meeting, officials in the Department are progressing avenues and have vowed to engage with the society as they do this.  We are also engaging with the European Commission on the feasibility of the various options related to protecting our own species of bee.  To this end, discussions are taking place with officials in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  There are certain elements in place for native wild bees whereas native honeybees are more domesticated varieties so they fall under a different Department.  The NPWS will look into elements such as invasive species that fall within its remit.  In tandem, Department officials and bee associations in conjunction with the NPWS are investigating and progressing options in relation to the query at hand.  They are also working on matters related to education aimed at new beekeepers because there has been quite a bit of interest in beekeeping over the last while.  It is important that beekeepers know the type of bee they are getting and what is the best bee for them.  If that is the native Irish honeybee, all the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#D00100","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I was told there was told there was a great buzz about this today.

The mushroom industry is the largest horticultural sector in Ireland with a farm gate value of &euro;119 million, of which approximately 85% is exported to the UK.  It employs over 3,500 people.  County Monaghan is well known for its indigenous industry.  One of the most successful of these local industries is the mushroom sector, which employs hundreds and hundreds of people and supports local farms and businesses and by extension, many local communities.  The sector is crucial to the economy, particularly in the north of County Monaghan.  However, the industry now faces a significant, and in my opinion unneeded, challenge at a time when it faces the consequences of both Brexit and Covid.  A ban on peat harvesting will have a very serious impact on the mushroom industry in County Monaghan.  The industry is heavily reliant on high-grade peat and there is currently no viable alternative to horticultural peat.  If peat is not available here in Ireland, the mushroom industry will be forced to import it from the Baltic states or from northern Europe at a huge cost both in financial terms to the industry and in the form of the higher carbon footprint of transporting that peat into the country.<\/p> <p>What sense is there in damaging a successful local industry for little or no environmental gain?  It seems to be a case of cutting off our environmental noses to spite our face.  To put things in perspective, there are 1.5 million ha of peatland in Ireland of which only 5,500 ha, approximately, are used for horticultural peat.  That is less than 0.35%.  Mushroom-casing peat represents a small fraction of this and probably as little as 10 ha to 15 ha annually.  The Minister must introduce measures to ensure the resumption of the harvesting of horticultural peat for the mushroom industry to avoid a shortage this year, as well as a measures to financially incentivise the use of spent mushroom compost.  We need a fair and efficient system which can allow horticultural peat harvesting to continue while the environmental alternatives to peat are researched and scaled up.  I acknowledge the great work done by Monaghan Mushrooms on this, which is ongoing.  All the sector is looking for is a just transition structure.  The door is not closed to this but the sector needs time to assess the environmental, economic and employment benefits of such a measure.  I urge the Minister of State to take these issues on board because the mushroom industry is hugely important to County Monaghan.  If anything was to happen to it, or if it was to be damaged in any way, it would have serious consequences for the whole north Monaghan economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#D00700","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for bringing this very important issue to the House.  I appreciate the importance of the mushroom sector in Ireland, particularly in the Senator's own area of Monaghan.  My Department has no involvement in the regulation of peat extraction.  This is a planning process under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and an integrated pollution control, IPC, licence process under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It is important to point out that there is no harvesting ban on peat.  Rather there is a requirement for compliance with regulatory frameworks for the abstraction, which requires both planning and IPC licensing depending on circumstances.<\/p> <p>Regarding the future use of peat moss in the horticulture sector, last September, the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform, Deputy Noonan, published a report on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  The review report was prepared by an inter-agency working group following on from the submissions from stakeholders.  After the publication of this report, the Minister of State proposed the establishment of a working group to include representatives from relevant Departments and State agencies, environmental NGOs and industry stakeholders under an independent chairperson to examine the issues identified during the review.  The working group has been set up and has met many times.  It has addressed the key issues raised in the report itself, including future use of peat by the horticulture sector.  The first meeting of the independent working group took place on 4 March.  The group has met several times since then and has submitted an interim report to the Minister of State for his consideration.  The Minister of State and his officials are currently examining the report.  I understand the Minister of State wrote to the working group in the past week or so.<\/p> <p>In addition to these developments, my Department is actively looking at alternatives to peat and has funded two research projects to date.  It has also recently sought further research be conducted here to explore alternatives to peat-based growing media for horticultural production in this area in its latest research call for 2021.  These must be available, affordable and sustainable and meet quality as well as increasing environmental requirements.<\/p> <p>My Department also provides a support to the horticulture industry through the scheme of investment aid for the development of the horticulture sector.  Financial support is available to assist growers and businesses through grant aid for capital investments in specialised plant and equipment, including renewable energy, as well as technology adoption specific to commercial horticulture production.  The budget has increased to &euro;9 million, which is a 50% increase, for 2021.  This particular budget is always oversubscribed.  It is really successfully.  This scheme is 100% funded by the Irish Government.<\/p> <p>In addition, my Department administers the EU producer organisation scheme for fruit and vegetables, which allows growers to jointly market their production  in order to strengthen the position of producers in the marketplace.  This scheme is a significant support to the mushroom sector in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#E00100","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response.

We need to be able to support the sector and move to that place where it is not so reliant on peat.  Within the mushroom sector, the research has looked at spent mushroom casings, blending that with other substrates, reducing the amount of peat in casing and looking at possibilities such as coir.  This is from coconut husk and would have to be imported but the environmental damage would have to be measured up.  We could look at wood fibre while biochar is another option.  The research needs to be done but at the end of the day, we all know that peat harvesting will stop.

Despite the amazing efforts of the board of management, the principal, the parents, all the school staff and the pupils, children are being educated in a building comprising four storeys over a basement.  There are serious concerns about the plaster work in some of the classrooms, the car park has to function as a playground and there is no lift so any child with a mobility impairment finds it incredibly difficult to access the upper floors.  Despite all that and the thriving and diverse school community, we have no progress on the long-promised school building for this school.  What is really galling about this situation is that year after year the Department of Education is forking out &euro;300,000 in rent for what is essentially a substandard building.<\/p> <p>I want to raise two key issues.  The first is the delay in progressing the new building and the second is the shameful manner in which the Department has treated the school.  After a campaign late last year, the Minister for Finance gave a clear-cut commitment to the parents and school management that stage 2(b) would be completed within a matter of weeks at the end of 2020 and the start of 2021 as opposed to months and that construction would commence some time between July and September 2021.  This was followed up by a reply to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that the stage 2(b) process would be completed and submitted to the Department no later than November 2020.  It is six months on with no sign of stage 2(b) and no prospect of construction taking place next month.  The children will get their school holidays tomorrow and we are facing into another September of the school having to operate in this building with no clarity as to when it will get its new school building.  I can tell the Minister of State that the frustration within the school community is palpable.<\/p> <p>As already stated, the second key issue relates to how the school has been treated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have had to resort to submitting freedom of information requests to understand the engagement between the Department and the owners of the building adjacent to the proposed school building with regard to right of way, a flue vent and other matters.

Will clarity be provided to the board of management as soon as possible?  What commitments can now be made to the children, parents, school management and staff with regard to the date of construction?  I understand that there are 357 schools on the list of prioritised school projects.

I hope I will be able to give the Senator a comprehensive response which will address some of the issues she has raised.<\/p> <p>As the Senator knows, this project is included in the Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan.  The brief is to provide a new 16-classroom school on a site being purchased by the Department from Dublin City Council.  This new school building will abut and be directly connected to the listed building on the neighbouring site.  Planning permission was secured for this project on 28 May 2020 on the basis of a proposed amended right of way.  Discussions have been ongoing with the owner of the neighbouring property with a view to finalising an agreement in respect of the proposed amended right of way and matters arising from the abuttal of the two buildings.<\/p> <p>The major building project for this school is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  As the Senator mentioned, this is stage 2B which involves the detailed design work.  This includes the applications for planning permission, a fire certificate and a disability access certificate as well as the preparation of tender documents.  All statutory approvals have been secured but amendment to these approvals may be needed if there are changes agreed in relation to the right of way which impact on them.  The design team is currently working to complete the stage 2B report which, upon completion, will be submitted to the Department for review.  However, it is not possible for the design team to complete drawings and costings relating to the final design until such time as final agreement between all parties in relation to an amended right of way has been agreed.  In parallel with this work, any consequent statutory approvals or compliance issues will need to be addressed and the legal position relating to the right of way will be addressed.<\/p> <p>In order to expedite the progression of this project, in January of this year the Department authorised the design team to commence the pre-qualification process to select a shortlist of contractors for this project in parallel with the completion of the stage 2B report.

How is it that last December assurances were given that construction would commence between July and September of this year when, in the response I have got today, we have been told that the final design is awaiting final agreement between all parties, that the process is ongoing and that meetings have yet to take place with regard to the completion of stage 2B?

I ran in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in the general election of last year and I was surprised to find that the issue of thalidomide was raised at three or four doors as I went about campaigning.  I was further surprised to find, when canvassing for James Geoghegan, the Fine Gael by-election candidate, in Sandymount last week, that one whole road of people raised this issue with me as well.  When I speak to colleagues, people ask whether thalidomide is still a thing.  It is important to realise that it is very much still a thing.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that thalidomide was a drug issued by a German company which was available in Ireland in the early 1960s and late 1950s as an antidote to morning sickness for women who particularly suffered with it.  In 1961, the manufacturer became aware of concerns about the effect the drug had on the unborn child.  In November 1961, it made that clear and, in January 1962, warnings were sent out to pharmacies and doctors in Ireland.  However, the Department of Health did not issue a public warning until June 1962.  This means there was a period of approximately six months in which women continued to take thalidomide without being aware of these effects.  <\/p> <p>The effect of this is still to be seen today.  It is difficult to estimate the exact number of thalidomide survivors in this country.  Officially, the Department says there are 29 because there are 29 people involved in litigation.  Depending on how the effect of the drug is categorised, there are either 36 or 37 people in this country who survived the effects thalidomide had on them before they were born.  The associated disabilities, the effects this drug had on them, range from a missing or disabled limb to substantial incapacitation.  Some of these people require 24-hour care.  They are in their early 60s, they have borne these problems and disabilities throughout their lives and they and their families continue to bear them.<\/p> <p>What is, perhaps, most striking about this whole process, based on the conversations I have had with people involved with the survivors of thalidomide, is that the mothers of those people, the women who took that drug, bore guilt notwithstanding that they were not at fault and made no mistake because they were not told.  Many of those mothers are no longer with us but they bore a great burden of guilt right up to the moment of their death for what happened to their children before they were born.

First and foremost, an apology.  There is no doubt to my mind, reading the documentation and looking at media reports, that the Irish Government failed in its duty to its citizens by not issuing a warning in advance of June 1962.  I am aware that there is litigation in place and that the Minister of State may be hamstrung, to a certain extent, by that.  It is not about apportioning blame; it is about accepting responsibility.  In modern times, one of the things that the State has actually done is to confess to its crimes and failings of the past.  I have seen that in this Chamber since I have become a Senator, as well as over the last number of years.  It is appropriate.  The very least that these people could expect from the Department of Health is that they would get a heartfelt and sincere apology.  <\/p><p>Second, they are looking for compensation.  In the course of the litigation to which I have referred, I understand the State has asserted that the discovery process alone will cost &euro;24 million.  I do not know how that figure is arrived at.  I cannot conceive of how much documentation must be involved.  If we are dealing with about 30 people, &euro;24 million cannot be far off what they would be getting in compensation anyway, if successful.  We need to set aside the bureaucracy and look at a fair and equitable compensation scheme for these people.<\/p><p>Third, we need to look at a medical scheme for them.  Yes, they have received a medical card and that is right and proper.  However, we are dealing with people, some of whom have significant incapacitation,and many of whom do not know how bad their condition is going to get in the coming 20, 30 or 40 years.  What is the effect going to be on them?  How are they going to support their medical needs?  The State needs to step in.

The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under the foundation Act.  All thalidomide survivors entitled to benefits are entitled to a lifelong monthly pension ranging from &euro;8,928 to &euro;100,765 annually, annual special payments since 2009 of between &euro;460 and &euro;3,600, and annual specific needs payments since 2017 of between &euro;5,676 and &euro;14,700.  I am aware that I have listed a lot of figures, but the information is available in the note that has been circulated to Senators.<\/p><p>Both the German payments and the Irish <i>ex gratia<\/i>monthly payments made to survivors are exempt from tax, including deposit interest retention tax, and are not reckonable, or in other words, assessable, as means for the purpose of Department of Social Protection payments.  In addition, each Irish survivor is provided with health supports, including a medical card on an administrative basis, regardless of means, in addition to appliances, artificial limbs, equipment, housing adaptations and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services.<\/p><p>In April 2010, the Government decided to provide additional financial assistance and other supports for Irish thalidomide survivors to meet their needs into the future.  The measures included an offer of an additional one-off <i>ex gratia<\/i>individual payment of &euro;62,500.  This offer was subsequently accepted by a number of the survivors.  A senior manager in the HSE was also designated to liaise with survivors in relation to meeting their ongoing health and personal social service needs.  I wish to inform the House that work is under way in the Department of Health to bring forward legislative proposals on health and personal social services for Irish survivors of thalidomide on a statutory basis.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013, it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide-related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the foundation for assessment of his or her disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that his or her injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the issues raised by the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#G00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I understand where the Minister of State is coming from and the restrictions of the <i>sub judice<\/i>rule, but there is not very much new in the document provided by the Minister of State.

One of the topics discussed was endometriosis.  Senators will be aware that I have consistently raised this issue in the Seanad.  I was very happy to play my part in bringing about an information session to bring to hundreds of GPs from throughout the country the most up-to-date information on this disease from an expert in the UK.  The event went very well and I commend and congratulate the ICGP on arranging the webinar, bringing up-to-date information to GPs and helping us to take one step closer to having better menstrual and reproductive care for women and girls in this country.<\/p> <p>I will briefly comment on the ongoing Common Agricultural policy, CAP, negotiations.  I commend the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, on his engagement in the process.  It has been difficult as there are a great number of competing interests and there is not, unfortunately, a uniform voice across the farming organisations.  I come from a rural constituency, Mayo, where farm holdings are mainly small.  Farmers in my community are asking for front-loaded payments, a higher degree of convergence and a cap on the single farm payment.  No farmer should be receiving more than &euro;60,000 annually from that scheme.<\/p> <p>I welcome that convergence is to be set at 85%, with the option for member states to increase beyond that if they so wish.  I urge the Minister to consider that option of increasing the percentage further.<\/p> <p>I also welcome that 3% of direct payments will be set aside for young farmers.  A particular problem in this country is that young people do not view farming as a viable long-term career option because of the challenge farmers face in getting a fair price for their product and all of the demands we are placing on them, arising from climate change and everything else.<\/p> <p>The proposed agreement will have to be signed off by all the EU agricultural ministers.  There will also be a period of consultation and debate to consider what has been proposed.  All in all, we are progressing towards a fairer outcome for small and medium-sized farmers, while still acknowledging and rewarding productive farmers.<\/p> <p>There is much anticipation that we will see a delay in reopening, with a decision due possibly tomorrow at this rate.  I make a special plea for those who are having their weddings in the next couple of weeks.  I can understand the delay in reopening hospitality.  While I may not fully agree with it, I can see the argument for doing so in terms of the sheer numbers.  The small number of couples who are getting married in the two-week period in question have probably had to postpone their big day numerous times already and will have issued invitations, paid a deposit and made plans on foot of the plan we set out for them.  In the event that the rug is pulled from under them for a couple of weeks, I urge the Government to take a flexible approach and rather than issuing a blanket delay to all aspects of the planned reopening, I ask that it consider each element on its merits and give special consideration to couples who are looking forward to their big day in the next number of weeks.  They should be allowed to have the 50 guests we promised they could have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#K00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I marched in November 2016 in support of the &euro;850 million Apple data centre in Athenry.

It should be noted that the Apple data centre project has been granted planning permission by Galway County Council for some time.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that decision was upheld in mid-2016.  That decision was also upheld by the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  I have spoken previously on the issues and problems with our planning process and more so on the legal challenges to and judicial reviews of planning decisions that have taken place, which are too prevalent.  I, therefore, welcome comments by the Attorney General and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, on the Government's plans to speed up the planning process.  The plans being considered include a dedicated planning court, which I called for in 2017 in the midst of the debate on the Apple data centre project.  As well as construction and permanent jobs in the data centre, having Apple, the world&rsquo;s largest company, with a centre in Galway, would be a major incentive to more and continued multinational investment.  The spin-off of having an Apple data centre in Athenry would be major.  The area from Athenry to Oranmore has been designated as an economic corridor in the Galway county development plan for some years.  With water, grid, rail and motorway connections, the area is well suited as an economic driver for the county.  Because of the issues in Athenry we changed legislation to categorise data centres as critical infrastructure but in May 2018 Apple announced it was not proceeding with the development.  However, it is important to note it still has planning permission.  I,  therefore, welcome the decision of Apple to apply to Galway County Council for a five-year extension to its planning permission.  If granted, I hope Apple will be able to proceed, at speed, and as soon as possible.  It gave an absolute commitment at the time it would look at green energy as the source of energy for that important project.  There was some small degree of opposition to the project but it would have been, and still had the potential to be, a major boom to the area of Athenry, Oranmore and County Galway.  <\/p><p>I call for a debate on the issue of planning, as I have previously, for projects such as this one and also projects ranging from greenways to road projects to the critically important issue of housing.  I welcome the comments by the Attorney General and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, relating to planning.  It is an extremely important area and one on which the Government is right to focus.  I hope it can do so to allow for a speeding up of the process at an early juncture.

The death toll today is 4,989, thankfully a long way from what was predicted.  We now have the data.  We now know the virus.  We know what to do to keep ourselves safe and what level of risk to take.  On 31 May, I spoke up in this Chamber about the contradictions in the Government&rsquo;s reopening plan.  However, nothing was done.  Hotels served dinners indoors while restaurants and pubs had their trade confined to outdoors.  Back in May I agreed with the comments of Adrian Cummins of the Restaurants Association of Ireland who called the double standards unjust and discriminatory.  However, nothing was done.  Hospitality struggled on with one glimmer of hope - 5 July.  Nearly a month on from 31 May, I find myself disheartened, dispirited and unmotivated to see the already inadequate plan is about to be changed.  The date of 5 July, with the already overdue promises it held, is about to be ripped away.  Nearly a month on from 31 May, I find myself using the same rhetoric - people in power are playing with people&rsquo;s lives and that is a very serious problem.  Does the Government realise the impact this will have on pubs and restaurants or on our aviation sector?  Does it realise the impact it is having on all those currently in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and waiting to go back to work?  Does it realise how long our hospitality and aviation sectors have already suffered?  If the Government realised the impact its lack of leadership is having, it would not be waiting until Wednesday, 30 June, five days before the promised date of 5 July, to decide whether it will help or hinder hospitality in this country.  If it chooses to hinder it by refusing to stick to the roadmap, the consequences will be serious.<\/p> <p>I listened to an interview on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 of Dr. Sam McConkey, probably better know as &ldquo;Dr. Zero Covid&rdquo; who stated the 5 July date for reopening of our next phase should go ahead.  I cannot stress the damage that would be done due to the Government&rsquo;s decision and its subsequent indecision about its decisions.  To lock down or not to lock down, that is the constant question we ask in this country and the result is severe instability.<\/p> <p>Over the weekend I read an interesting article on the city state of Singapore, which has decided to treat Covid like any other endemic disease such as flu.  It has stopped its zero transmission targets, its people will stop wearing masks, it will halt lockdowns and it will no longer require quarantines.  Its people will learn to live with Covid-19.  In the words of their trade, finance and health ministers, \"We can't eradicate it, but we can turn the pandemic into something much less threatening, like influenza, ... or chickenpox, and get on with our lives.\"  Get on with our lives, that is what we all want to do, but when will that happen?  This Government will not be able to decide on anything, so I could not ask it to decide on that.  Instead I will tell it now and when it should happen.  Now is when we should be leading the country back with strong leadership.  Now is when we should get on with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#L00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I want to raise the case of Terence Wheelock.  Terence was a young man, aged 20, from Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Casey Avenue in Summerhill in Dublin 1 who died in Garda custody 16 years ago.  Sixteen years on, his family are still seeking answers about what happened to him in that Garda cell in Store Street.  Sixteen years on, there are so many questions with regard to inconsistencies in Garda record keeping, conflicts of views as to how a ligature could have made its way into the cell and be found in the place it was found, and how quickly the emergency services were called.  While the inquest found he died by suicide, from talking to his family and listening to his community, it is very clear nobody believes Terence went into that cell with the intent of taking his life.<\/p><p>Last Saturday there was a remembrance event for Terence and his late brother Larry who did so much to fight to clear his brother&rsquo;s name and for his brother's right to justice.  Walking alongside his family, relatives, neighbours and friends, the unanswered questions were very striking.  Any of us who have lost someone knows the visceral desire to know why and how.  If somebody dies in mysterious circumstances that is all the more the important to know.  What was utterly heartbreaking is that while I was walking with my baby girl in a buggy, a woman alongside me had a child no older than three and he turned to her and asked &ldquo;Mammy, what does justice mean?&rdquo;.  This quest for answers has been passed on to the next generation of the family.  We need to have a statutory independent inquiry into this case.  In 2010, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission undertook an investigation but from my reading of the 199-page report there are serious questions arising from it.  I want the message to go out that we need to have a statutory independent inquiry into the death of Terence.  <\/p><p>I want to reference another event that took place on Saturday, namely the protest rally on the National Maternity Hospital.  It was an extremely powerful moment for the many hundreds who turned out to make their voice very clear on the issue.  There were articles in the <i>Business Post <\/i>yesterday and a letter in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>this morning discussing concerns over religious ethos and suggesting that some of those concerns may not be well founded.  I think the articles missed the point.  If we are going to have a new hospital, we need to have it on publicly owned land, publicly operated and with a publicly controlled governance structure, and nothing less will do.  For too long we have had systems in this country that are convoluted by being semi-privately owned or partially controlled by religious structures or elsewhere.  We do not need to delay the project.  There is an opportunity to get the National Maternity Hospital right.  I share the concerns expressed and look forward to the debate on it that will take place on Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#L00300","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>On 27 June 1995, a former Senator, Gordon Wilson, passed away.

In Dublin, average prices now range from between &euro;350,000 and &euro;600,000.  Of course, Covid has had some impact on supply but Government policy is also to blame.  The help-to-buy scheme fuelled house-price inflation and the proposed shared equity scheme will simply add fuel to the fire.  At the weekend we discovered that even the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage's officials had warned against the shared equity scheme but he is ploughing ahead regardless.  The Minister should come here and explain why, despite the warnings from all of the experts, he is arrogantly insisting on proceeding with the scheme.<\/p><p>The Minister also needs to tell the House how he will ensure that the houses on the Poolbeg site will be genuinely affordable.  The National Asset Management Agency offered that land to the previous housing Minister, Eoghan Murphy, at a 50% discount.  However, even when it would benefit his constituents, Mr. Murphy refused the offer.  Instead, Ronan Group Real Estate purchased the site at a price significantly higher than the guide price.  He is planning to build even more unaffordable build-to-rent apartments in the community.  On the 570 affordable homes that are allocated in the plans, Dublin City Council has confirmed that there is no deal on the table as to how much Johnny Ronan's company will demand for those homes.  In order to ensure its profit margin, it is highly likely that the Ronan Group Real Estate could seek up to &euro;500,000 from Dublin City Council for each of those affordable homes.  How is anyone from the community expected to be able to afford to buy?  The Minister needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ronan Group Real Estate and insist that the affordable homes on the site will be genuinely affordable.<\/p><p>The Government should make it very clear to Ronan Group Real Estate that there will be no bridge, and no funding allocated for such a bridge, unless there is a deal on affordability.

We've been told &quot;no live music&quot;, we've done what we've been told - we stayed home.  We haven't worked, we haven't sought-out work, we've listened, waiting for guidance from our Minister.  Waiting for life to start again.<br \/><br \/>Why then ... is there concerts happening in different venues all over the country - including actual indoor Tourism, Culture and Gaeltacht events just this last weekend.<br \/><br \/>We need to have clarity as to what is allowed - can we perform now?  Is it okay to go back on the road?  <br \/><br \/>I want to express how much anxiety this is bringing me, with the unknown, with the looming possible dates for causing the PUP.  I'm worried about paying my rent.  I'm worried about paying my car insurance, and I'm worried I won't be able to afford my internet phone bill, which will put me off again from the world, even more than I am today, with no work and no idea as to when we are officially back.<br \/><br \/>For us musicians - as the cultural ambassadors for our nation, we feel forgotten, we are confused, and we are deeply hurt by the lack of communication from the Minister and the Department.  The anxiety is at the highest level, not knowing where we stand and when we might go back to work.  My friends\/colleagues, are selling their instruments, and it's becoming regular to know musicians who have taken their own lives due to the stress of everything and the lack of support and information.<br \/><br \/>Musicians are also the first to be called upon to step up to give our services for free to raise money for under-funded charities.  Musicians are always the first to step up.<br \/><br \/>Musicians who perform for tourists all over the country are the foot soldiers of our culture, keeping music alive in the toughest of arenas, playing and performing in the smallest of corners, the loudest of pubs, keeping our culture alive.<br \/><br \/>These &quot;test&quot; events are not helpful for us who do this every day - it is like &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, only the top most popular musicians are being looked after.  We need clear guidance and information, and for the Minister to talk directly to the musicians and the events industry of Ireland.  We're calling on the Minister to ensure the PUP is in place for musicians until 2022, and we need information to save our mental health as this anxiety will kill our culture and kill our souls and our spirits, and ourselves.

It is coming to the end of a time when I will be able to speak on it.  In 2010, the future helicopter study group, FHSG, started to look at what Ireland needed for search and rescue.  There was a number of recommendations.  One was the implementation of night vision on helicopters.  Another was the ability to carry underslung loads in buckets for fighting fires.  The third was that they would be able to carry incubators.  Ten years on, despite having spent &euro;700,000 plus VAT per aircraft on upgrading them for night vision, and buying goggles for the crews at the cost of &euro;570,000 that the taxpayer paid for, the training has not been completed, as far as I know.  They cannot carry the incubators.  Anytime there is an incubator call, the Air Corps has to step in.  Neither have they been able to provide the underslung buckets.  The last time there was a fire in Kerry, we had to call in aircraft from Scotland, as well as the Air Corps.<\/p> <p>Who is responsible for oversight?  We are responsible for political oversight, but who is responsible for oversight?

I send my thoughts and prayers to the survivors, the families of survivors, the families of the victims, and the families of those missing.  There are still 156 people missing.  It is a tragedy of a huge scale, where a building collapsed during the middle of the night.  There are terrifying, heart-breaking images of bunk beds hanging out of windows.  It is completely unfathomable and deeply upsetting.  We learned also that an engineers&rsquo; report was commissioned a few years previously.  It outlined serious structural issues with the property.  Nobody is saying that they were the cause, but the fact is that there were structural issues and repairs were needed to the property.<\/p> <p>We need to look at properties in Ireland.  There is a 2018 chartered surveyors' report that states that the majority of Irish apartment buildings do not have a large enough sinking fund.  I am not saying that buildings are imminently going to collapse.  However, as here, not enough money has been put aside for structural improvements to properties.  Many of our apartment blocks were built in the 1990s.  They are okay at the moment.  We do not hear of a huge number of structural issues.  However, anecdotally, we hear that residents of older apartment blocks are being asked to cough up either &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 per unit to fix roofs.  We need to figure out what we can do.  The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 stipulates that &euro;200 per year must be set aside per unit towards a sinking fund.  That is not enough.  Those who owns a small house or apartment will know that &euro;200 is not going to cover a lot.  We also have to look at local property tax.  Many apartment dwellers pay local property tax but do not get a lot back from it.  The Government needs to review sinking funds and, perhaps, how local property tax could be inputted into developing sinking funds for properties.  This is an issue that will come down the tracks very fast, as apartment blocks that were built in the 1990s get older.<\/p> <p>We need to have a serious debate in this House about how we address sinking funds.  At the moment, they are completely inadequate.

This will be a great experience for the kids.  I am sure the parents might not have the same view.  It will be an unusual period for the next few weeks.  I want to mention something about primary education.  There is a major issue we need to start talking about.  Over the last few weeks, the Drumcondra tests have been done in primary education.  From first to six class, there is a period of exams.  Results from second, fourth, and sixth classes are reported to the Department of Education.<\/p> <p>There is a major flaw within the Drumcondra process itself.  The flaw is that a dyslexic child is being discriminated against through this process.  This is a huge issue that we have to take into consideration.  Children who have a reading average of maybe a one, a three or a seven centile, depend on technology to help them go through the primary education process.  When it comes to the Drumcondra tests, that assistive technology is taken away from them.  Could you imagine a scenario where a student is helped to read every day in his or her class with a reading pen or iPad?  Then, when he or she does the Drumcondra tests, the iPad and reading pen is taken from him or her.  Over a 45-minute period, the student is then expected to do something he or she cannot physically do.  He or she cannot read the question.

It is not mandatory.  How we deal with dyslexic children continues to be a disgrace.  If I were to give the Department of Education a grade, it would be an F.  That is the standard at which it is treating children on the ground.  <\/p><p>We need to have a serious conversation about how we are going to deal with these kids.  They deserve better.  I met parents at the weekend who have kids in the one centile, which means that they are between the bottom 1% and 3% in reading.  Their children had the assistive technology taken from them when they did the Drumcondra test.  That cannot be logical.  There are also mental issues to consider.  These children are lovely lads.  They went home thinking they were thick.  They are anything but thick.  They are probably the cleverest in the class but they are wired differently.

Last Thursday evening, I attended and spoke at a webinar organised by Together for Safety in Limerick.  Two particular issues concern me.  First, we need safe access zone legislation.  Protests were held outside the maternity hospital in Limerick every day during Lent.  I know that protests were also held at other hospitals.  I gather from the response to a recent Commencement matter that the Government is actually retreating from introducing this legislation.  A Minister of State gave that clear message on the day the matter was taken.

The reason is that only one in ten GPs offer services and half of our maternity hospitals do not offer termination services.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, alongside others on a cross-party basis.

What I see in my own county is lots of empty buildings and also lots of people doing Airbnb.  I want to clearly distinguish between a person letting out a room in his or her house and one letting out a whole house because a whole house is a potential home for someone to rent and live in.  A room in a house is in a person's home so it is a different thing.  We have some Airbnb restrictions in Dublin but we do not have any in County Clare, for example.<\/p> <p>I know from going around the villages and towns of the county that we have loads of empty houses.

We must offer a carrot to the owners of these empty houses but we may also need a bit of a stick in the form of looking at the vacant property tax because it is not moving quick enough.  There is a housing emergency and we must do much more.  The local authority should be asked to do proper research on empty houses all over County Clare.  Some people do not seem to know who owns what.  We do not have proper data.  A friend of mine is a statistician and was trying to research the housing issues and empty houses in Ireland.

I wish him a fast recovery.  Conor Murray happens to be a member of my own club.  He is also a very proud Garryowen, Munster and Ireland rugby player and it is a great honour for Ireland that we have a captain based in Ireland.  I know his former schools, St. Munchin's College and Scoil &Iacute;de, are very proud of him as well.  I wish him all the best in his term as captain.  It is a proud day for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#P00500","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for their contributions.  I echo what Senator Byrne has said.  It is an ill wind that never blows any good and it is great news and will give a lift to all Irish people, particularly rugby fans, to have Conor Murray as captain.  I wish the whole team every success in the tour.<\/p> <p>A number of colleagues have asked for a debate tomorrow on the reopening.  I must apologise because I do not think it is possible as the schedule for tomorrow is already set and I am not sure I would get a rearranged schedule.  However, the frustration is absolutely palpable this morning, not just in here but everywhere, be it in one's local shop or chatting with friends in a WhatsApp group or on any social media channels.  There was a poll done last week and I think the country was relatively evenly divided on whether we should open up fast or be cautious.  If that poll was taken this week a different response might be got.  I really do wish our Cabinet colleagues making the decision tomorrow well.  I am very glad I am not going to be one of those making the decision because one would be caught between a rock and a hard place.  There is absolutely no doubt that our hospitality and tourism industry, and indeed our companies which are reliant on tourists coming here and tourists leaving, are really on their knees and probably can take no more.  However, at the same time, we must be mindful.  Having made every decision in the public's best interest for the last year it would be awful to see us slip at the very last hurdle.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government is between a rock and a hard place but certainty is required and it would be better to get that as soon as possible.  I acknowledge everybody's contributions on that issue.  Senator Casey is right that it is like Groundhog Day.  I fear that in the next few weeks we will be talking about the Delta plus variant.  While NPHET has made a valuable contribution over the past year with its weekly and biweekly briefings, it would be mightily helpful and would not annoy people as much if its members went back to being advisers to Cabinet and did not give personal opinions on the airwaves every single day because it is driving people insane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#P00600","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#Q00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>On Senator Fitzpatrick's point, I will respectfully decline the request to write a letter to the Minister because I already know the answer.  We cannot change what An Bord Plean&aacute;la is doing until we change the legislation.  I have invited the Minister to come in after he announces his Housing for All plan on 13 July, which we are looking forward to hearing and will all hopefully support.  I have invited him to come in, time permitting, to have a debate on that as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan spoke about the review of the abortion legislation.  It is imperative that the chairperson is truly independent.  I was concerned when I heard him say that he believes, based on a Topical Issue debate, that we will not be proceeding with exclusion zones.  Much as I appreciate that the one third of people who voted against the referendum are entitled to make their views known, and it is important that we do know them, it is a real pity that any woman should be intimidated while going about what she feels is right for her and making decisions for herself.  I do not know what the difficulty is.  I  concur 100% that all medics should be able to make the decision themselves as to whether they will offer these services but that is no reason for every hospital not to be obligated to recruit people who will offer those services, which would not put anyone in an awkward position.  For nine of our 17 hospitals not to offer services that are legal and available in the State is just not acceptable.  Direction should be given to those nine hospitals to recruit people who will offer those services.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer requested that a debate on reopening be held tomorrow.  Again, I am sorry but I cannot do that.  However, I will try to organise one as soon as I can because I do not think we are at the end of the debate on this matter.<\/p><p>Senator McGreehan talked about the Love This Place, Leave No Trace campaign.  The fact that we are all spending so much more time outdoors means we are constantly reminded that we all need to share this space and be mindful of each other.<\/p><p>Senator Hoey asked for a debate on eating disorders.  I will try to arrange that for the first week we come back or the second week in September.<\/p><p>I was in pain listening to what Senator Lombard said because I have a little lady at home who has gone through exactly the experience he spoke about.  Approximately 10% of our population are made feel, through no fault of their own, like they are inadequate or that there is something wrong with them when there is not.  I agree that we should change the Drumcondra test but we should also change the fact that when parents are made get that test so the child can be diagnosed as dyslexic, it does not get them any extra resources unless the relevant school has a central pool.  What is the point of acknowledging that a child has an issue without giving him or her the required help to get them through?<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh talked about sinking funds.  She is right and maybe a review of the local property tax could help.  Organisations that built houses in the 1990s did not have the right regulations in place to ensure proper planning.  I will send a letter to the Minister and ask for a debate on that.<\/p><p>I am sorry but I do not know how to get Senator Craughwell the answers he is looking for.  I know how passionate he is about this issue.  I will write to the Secretary General of the Department today asking about the three issues he highlighted with regard to night vision, the undercarriage buckets and the incubators, and will come back to him on it.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke eloquently about a priest in Ballyfermot she knows.  I said last week or the week before that we take so much for granted and think everything is fine.  However, we know from examples of what happened over the weekend, as well as in Waterford and Capel Street, that not everything is fine.  We should never take anything for granted and we should say often and proud that love is love no matter what shape or size someone is.  We should continuously make sure we say that, and not just in Pride Week or Pride Month because the intimidation our colleagues, friends and family members suffer does not just happen in June; it happens all year round.  We should say that loud and often.<\/p><p>Senator Gallagher talked about the new programme of sexual consent classes that will be available in universities this summer, arising from the Union of Students in Ireland survey last year.  With respect, if we did a wider survey of all women in Ireland, and even some men, we might find that the shocking statistics about university students reflect Irish society as a whole.  We have an issue whereby people do not know when to take &quot;No&quot; for an answer or where to draw the line.  The consent classes should not just be available if people want to go.  They should be made compulsory for all people in third level institutions in first year.  They should also be repeated in second or third year and introduced into some secondary schools at an earlier age.<\/p><p>I ask Senator Black to send me a copy of the letter she read out.  I will certainly ask for a debate on that issue.  Again, I am not sure I will get access to the Minister in the next few weeks but she needs to read that letter and be mindful of her responsibility to the entire sector.  I am conscious of the decisions that are being made about reopening tomorrow and I do not mean to pre-empt them but if we are going to keep hospitality and tourism closed for the next few weeks the cut-off for new entrants to the PUP on 1 July has to be extended or abolished until we allow reopening.  That is also true of the live entertainment industry.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan spoke about the <i>daft.ie<\/i>report that was issued yesterday.  As I said, we will have a debate on housing when the Minister comes before us on 13 July to launch his new housing policy.  I look forward to that.<\/p><p>Senator Martin spoke eloquently.  He is absolutely right that this is a shared island and we need to be respectful and mindful of everybody on it.  I am not quite sure I could have been so forgiving as Gordon Wilson.  It is a testament to the man and his wife arising from their loss.<\/p><p>Senator Sherlock asked for a statutory inquiry into Terence Wheelock's passing.  It is awful to think that, 16 years later, a family is still fighting for justice.  The most I can offer is to write a letter to the Minister for Justice asking about the status of that investigation and what the plans for it are.  I will send the Senator a copy of the Minister's response when she comes back to me.<\/p><p>The most interesting thing Senator Keogan brought up this morning, apart from her frustrations, was the article about Singapore that came out on Sunday.  I read it too.  Sometimes it is frustrating to watch other countries that are so much further ahead in their thinking.  We all accept that just because we are all going to get vaccinated, please God, in the next few months, Covid is not just going to wilt away.  It is probably going to take a number of years.  We all need to be planning how best to live alongside Covid, particularly those who do not want to get vaccinated and our children, for whom no plans have been made yet.  That was a very interesting article and I acknowledge the Senator's frustration.<\/p><p>Senator Kyne talked about the planning process and the debacle that happened in Athenry a number of years ago.  In the new regulations and plans that will be announced for critical infrastructure legislation, we need to be mindful that we cannot hinder progress.  However, we also have to allow people to assert their rights when they have genuine reasons for doing so.<\/p><p>Senator Chambers opened today's proceedings by referring to the endometriosis seminar she organised.  I have been promising a debate on maternal health for the last few months.  Again, September will give us a bit more space and opportunity to discuss some of these matters as we will not have as much legislation to get through.  I will organise that as quickly as I can.<\/p><p>I will be accepting Senator Gavan's amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#Q00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Senator Gavan has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 19 be taken before No. 1.\"  The Leader has indicated that she is willing to accept it.

I particularly thank the Opposition for taking a co-operative approach.<\/p> <p>This Bill does not affect the conduct of industrial relations, nor does it place any restriction on the industrial relations process.  Careful note has been taken of the matters relating to public service pay.  I am pleased that the very large majority of public service unions and representative associations are engaged with the new public service agreement, Building Momentum, which is the first forum for engagement on industrial relations matters.  The agreement sets out a reform agenda and provides for pay increases, both of which will benefit workers across the public service.  Our approach is about balancing the need for pay restraint and stability and certainty in the delivery of public services with the need to support ongoing public service reform.  Key areas of our public services have experienced and responded to very challenging demands over the past year.  The Bill allows for the implementation of reasonable pay increases and provides a means of using pay to support the wider public service reform agenda, where appropriate.  It is on that basis that I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021062800002#T00700","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1624872600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his engagement on this Bill over recent weeks.

That is an important juncture for public servants.  As the Minister of State said, they have had a very difficult 12 months.  There have been numerous challenges and perhaps there will be new methods of working in the future, including remote working, which shows potential and which may have positive impacts with regard to regional balance.
