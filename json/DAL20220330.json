Nine counties do not have any such accommodation, including Laois and Offaly.  Children and victims are sent as far as three counties away, to Limerick, to domestic violence refuges.  More than 100 families went from Laois alone last year.  This cannot continue.  There is a shortage of places in the State overall.  We need to increase the numbers of beds and accommodation.  We all know that people are at their most vulnerable when fleeing domestic violence.  The victims often feel they have no option but to return.  People working with them will say as much.  The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, knows as a public representative that they will sometimes return to the family home where they have been abused.  The abuse then continues.  This can be repeated several times due to the lack of real alternatives.  That cycle has to be broken.<\/p>  <p>  This is the third decade in which I have raised the lack of facilities in Laois and Offaly.  Marna Carroll and her team in the Laois domestic abuse service have called for this.  We urgently need a domestic violence refuge in County Laois.  In Offaly, Anne Clarke is manager of the Offaly domestic violence support services, which badly needs facilities.  It uses a different model, which it calls three safe houses, in Birr, Tullamore and Edenderry, because of the geography of the county.  It tries to work in partnership with the county council, but it needs the Government's backing and support.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the review that the Government published, but it tells us the obvious, which I or people who work in the service could have said.  It states that nine counties do not have services and that there are huge geographical gaps, including in the midlands.  I appeal to the Minister of State to address this.  Provision is totally inadequate.  There is no provision across the midlands for those victims.  The State does not have enough spaces overall.  I see the Minister of State's reply indicates that the lack of overall spaces will be addressed.  The middle of the country is without any facilities.  Those three safe houses are needed in Offaly.  Laois has a different model, with a domestic violence refuge.  It is a good match between the two counties.  A high-level interdepartmental working group has been set up to review the current system of provision of refuge spaces.  I am concerned that this could go on for years.  We need to simplify it.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Departments are involved here.  We sometimes talk about bringing in all the stakeholders, consulting everybody and getting everybody involved.  There is an old saying that when everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible.  I am concerned that Tusla, the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are all involved, but somebody needs to catch the bull by the horns to steer this and drive it on.  This has been going on for years.  As we talk here this morning, there are people who have just fled domestic violence situations.  The murder of Ashling Murphy brought home the nature of violence against women.  I know that was not domestic violence, but it reinforced in people's heads the need to urgently address this.  There are real situations with families every day of the week.  I do not think anybody in the House would disagree with what is needed.  We need to get on with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000003#A00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1648627920,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanley for raising this important matter regarding the need for domestic violence accommodation in Laois and the midlands.  I reiterate that it is my goal and that of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, that everyone who needs a refuge space will get one.  I am familiar with the Wexford women's refuge and the Wexford rape crisis centre, and the great work done by both those bodies, so I understand the real importance of this.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee is deeply committed to working with partners in the sector and with Government colleagues to achieve this.  This Government has prioritised tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms, and ensuring that people, particularly women and vulnerable people, feel safe and are safe in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister, Deputy McEntee is leading work on a new whole-of-government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention and on ensuring victims are better supported.  It is the Minister's intention to publish the final strategy and accompanying action plan as soon as possible in the coming weeks.  The Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and McEntee, commissioned an independent audit of how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is segmented across the Government.  On foot of this, it has been agreed that the Department of Justice will assume responsibility for services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, in addition to policy responsibility and overall cross-Government co-ordination of implementation.  I hope that answers Deputy Stanley's concern about no one taking a lead on this.  The Department of Justice has been assigned for the lead for services as well as policy responsibility.  A detailed plan about how this will work is being prepared.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific issue of refuge spaces, in February, the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and McEntee, published the review by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  The review highlights gaps in geographical coverage and inadequate provision of safe accommodation, including refuges, to meet population needs.  Many Deputies have raised those gaps.<\/p> <p>Having it clearly in writing is important so we can put an implementation plan in place.<\/p> <p> The review recommended an approach to address this issue with immediate, medium and long-term actions required and provided a list of priority areas where additional services would address the most immediate need.  While the review states a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority, further analysis has identified ten locations nationwide where the delivery of 82 family refuge spaces would have the most impact if prioritised.  These locations and this refuge need have been chosen on the basis of required proximity to a refuge, as well as a need for refuge spaces per head of population in densely populated areas.  These are the areas with the most significant under-provision and are a starting point for increasing refuge spaces comprehensively and in every county across the country.  The initial areas identified in the Tusla review include Portlaoise, where eight family places are suggested as a starting point for prioritisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000003#A00300","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648628520,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

We need to reduce the amount of domestic violence and change attitudes and culture in society.  However, we also have to live in the here and now.  I welcome that the Tusla review recommends eight family places for Portlaoise.  That is suggested for prioritisation and as a starting point.

That is a positive step, as is the fact that one Department will be in charge of this.  It was a concern of mine up to now that it would move between Departments and different State agencies.  The important thing now is that we move on with this without delay.  Delivery takes a long time in this country but when the State wants to do something and push things on, whether schools or whatever else, they can be progressed very quickly in certain cases.  I ask that this be given high priority by the Government.  The Minister of State said the Minister has made it a priority and I welcome that.  It is very positive.  The Opposition will certainly welcome it as well because there is consensus on this matter and it needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  There are three safe houses in Offaly.  That is a different model.

They have remained open throughout the pandemic and must follow HSE protocols strictly, as required for congregated or healthcare settings, with all staff deemed healthcare workers in front-line services.  At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, both homeless and drug-using populations were identified as being particularly vulnerable to the effects of Covid.  As a board member of a community drug team, I have heard from our staff who were seconded, and happy to be, at a moment's notice to the HSE to ensure that those who were very vulnerable continued to avail of services.  This is very tough and demanding work at the best of times.  During the current pandemic, it was frightening for them but they turned up for work every day they were asked.  In fact, correspondence from the Chief Medical Officer to the Minister for Health at the onset of the pandemic classified the homeless cohort as one of his top priorities as a most vulnerable group.<\/p>  <p>  Those in the homeless sector were required to adapt their services strictly to the protocols insisted upon by the HSE and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, Covid response team.  Their client group is transient and they work with a high number of unvaccinated and medically vulnerable clients for a long period of time.  They are still continuing to implement the Covid-specific infection prevention and control measures, for longer than the general public and those in a significant number of other settings have.  This is even more important now given the massive spike in Covid cases.  The commitment of their staff in supporting the most vulnerable in our society, despite the risk to themselves, should be recognised along with other front-line workers.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Homeless Network is a network of 20 NGOs that are the majority voice of voluntary homeless organisations in Dublin.  These NGOs provide both residential accommodation and day services to people who are homeless and in need of a wide range of physical, mental and addiction health supports.  The network has asked on several occasions to be included in the Covid recognition scheme since the announcement by Government of a once-off Covid recognition payment for those who worked on the front line during Covid-19.  The network is asking for recognition on the basis that homeless services receive HSE and local authority grant funding for the payment of salaries to front-line workers; that staff in the sector are deemed healthcare workers; that Covid-19 protocols as directed by the HSE have been strictly adhered to, including the wearing of PPE equipment in clinical and congregated settings as required; that, under direction from the HSE, front-line staff including our nursing cohort conducted Covid testing and vaccinations; that associated staff, including auxiliary staff, worked in the same environment as nursing staff in clinical and congregated settings; and that staffing configuration and support in homeless services, including congregated settings, is similar to that in private nursing home settings.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 and section 10 front-line staff worked in similar clinical and congregated settings to those announced for the recognition payment scheme, starting from a time when there were no vaccinations available.  These organisations are just asking that their staff, including nurses, project workers, care workers, cleaners, catering and other auxiliary staff, who worked with residents, clients and service users on a face-to-face basis during this period have their contributions recognised for inclusion in this Covid recognition scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000004#B00500","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1648628520,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  On 19 January, the Government announced a Covid-19 recognition payment for front-line public sector healthcare workers, to recognise their unique role during the pandemic.  The payment of &euro;1,000, which is welcome, will not be subject to income tax, USC or PRSI.  The announcement also made provision for a <i>pro rata<\/i>application of the payment.  The measure will be ring-fenced to staff ordinarily on site in Covid-19 exposed healthcare environments in the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.  This payment will be made to those eligible public sector front-line healthcare staff, inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE, who worked in clinical settings.  The list is not exhaustive but includes doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, porters, cleaners etc. who work in clinical settings.  The measure also encompasses healthcare support assistants, also known as home carers or home help, employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE.  It also encompasses those eligible working on site in long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities, inclusive of HSE and section 39 facilities.  Finally, the measure also extends to equivalent healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices.  Arrangements for these sectors are currently being progressed by the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>The Government knows we have to apply this recognition to those who faced the highest risk and that is why this measure has been limited in scope.  While immense efforts have undoubtedly been made by other healthcare staff, by other staff in other sectors and by the general public since the onset of this pandemic, it is right that the Government pursues this course to recognise those who took the greatest risk in the performance of their duties.  The announcement covers eligible front-line healthcare workers only and I am also mindful of the many other workers throughout the country who played their part during this difficult period.<\/p> <p> It is difficult to draw a line under this matter but the Government based its decision on the risks which front-line healthcare workers faced.  The Deputy pointed out that these workers need to be recognised and that they were working as project workers, who took great care of their residents and clients.  That is one of the aspects of the care that was given to people who were vulnerable and in homelessness and I want to thank the workers for all the work they did.  I will raise this again and I will try to ensure that these people who did so much during the pandemic are recognised.

If it was not for the likes of the Simon Communities and all of those homeless agencies who provide a front-line service every day, the State would have to involve itself in those services and it would have to pay those people because they would be public service employees.  I find it really difficult to understand why there is a differentiation when it comes to the people in those services who are front-line workers, as the Minister of State admits consistently in his statement and as has been consistently admitted by the Minister.  That was the basis for why the payment was made in the first place.  When there were no vaccinations, when we knew nothing about Covid-19 and when we were hearing horror stories coming from Italy and China of people dying on a daily basis, there was huge fear and we asked those people on the front line to go into their jobs to work with the most vulnerable and highest risk people every single day.  They donned their PPE gear, carried out all the health and safety measures and did everything that was asked of them.  They were and they are the essence of front-line workers, along with the brilliant work the public service front-line workers did.  I would like to point out that the death in service <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme for healthcare workers includes those in homeless and outreach services.

King John's Castle is synonymous with Limerick city.  If one looks at items in the media, the first place one sees and thinks of is King John's Castle.  It has been part of the Shannon Group for many years and prior to that it was within the Shannon Development Group.  An agreement has been reached between the Shannon Group and Limerick City and County Council that King John's Castle will be transferred to Limerick City and County Council, effective from next Monday, 4 April.  I know many of the staff working there and they are excellent.  It has been agreed that a full transfer will be undertaken so that all of the 14 staff working there, along with part-time staff during the summer months, will automatically transfer.  They are going into a wholly owned subsidiary of Limerick City and County Council, Discover Limerick, which is a designated activity company, DAC.<\/p>  <p>  Limerick City and County Council has submitted a proposal, via the Shannon Group, to the Department on a funding gap for the first three years to enable it to have a smooth transition.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will be aware that the site had 111,000 tourists visiting it back in 2019.  Two years ago that had dropped to 50,000 and last year it was down to 24,000.  We want to put King John's Castle in a financial position such that it can come back to those numbers.  Limerick City and County Council has put this proposal to the Minister of State's Department via the Shannon Group and directly to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Already Limerick City and County Council looks forward to taking over the running of King John&rsquo;s Castle, along with its employees.  It has put &euro;500,000 into Discover Limerick DAC, which will be looking after all tourist activities.  That company is responsible for the management and operation of King John&rsquo;s Castle but with the move over, items that would have been dealt with under the Shannon Group such as IT systems; financial and human resources; marketing and sales; and legal issues will all have to be dealt with by Limerick City and County Council.  These issues will have major set-up costs.  Furthermore, Limerick City and County Council has already put a financial controller in place and is advertising for a sales and marketing official as well.<\/p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to provide a commitment from the Government.  I understand that discussions are ongoing between Limerick City and County Council and the Departments.  I want to see a commitment from the Government that whatever funding is required to enable that smooth transition will be forthcoming.  However, the good news is that King John&rsquo;s Castle is already operating seven days a week and come 4 April, next Monday, Limerick City and County Council will continue to operate it on a seven-day per week basis with the 14 employees and the summer workers who will come on board.  Limerick City and County Council is looking to grow the business there but we need initial Government support over the first year to ensure we can get to a point where King John&rsquo;s Castle is performing at a premium and gets to that figure of 111,000 tourists per annum and much higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000005#C00500","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1648629720,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell for giving me the opportunity to update the House on this topic.  As Members are aware, Shannon Group informed my Department in summer 2020 that it was necessary to consider a comprehensive and radical adjustment to its structure.  This was necessary due to the capital investment required to maintain the heritage sites and the lack of expertise in maintaining the sites in the group.  This was further impacted by the onset of Covid-19.  In 2021 several options were presented in a memorandum for Government, and the Government considered that the most appropriate option was for Shannon Group to explore the potential to transfer Shannon Heritage to the local authorities.  It was considered that this was the best way to secure the longer term viability of the business and the interests of Shannon Heritage employees, while maintaining the intrinsic heritage value of the sites for current and future generations.  Since that time Shannon Group has engaged and is continuing to engage with the relevant local authorities in regard to the transfer of the business of these key sites.  This includes the transfer of King John's Castle to Limerick City and County Council.  The agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be required to execute the transfer of the castle.  My Department is engaging with both Departments in this regard.<\/p><p>I am also continuing to engage with the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in regard to the conservation of the castle.  As the castle is a national monument, the OPW has responsibilities in regard to its conservation and maintenance.  In preparation for undertaking this role, the OPW has been carrying out the necessary assessment of the castle to inform the programme of works needed and the associated costs.  Shannon Group will continue to operate and manage the Shannon Heritage business prior to any transfer of King John's Castle to Limerick City and County Council.  It will do so in line with its commercial mandate and fiduciary best practice, and with awareness of the group's accountability for the proper management of the company.<\/p><p>This Government implemented a range of horizontal economy-wide supports early in the Covid-19 pandemic. Shannon Heritage has benefited from these supports including the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The continuation of Government support to Shannon Group through the subsequent extension of EWSS enabled King John's Castle to remain open during the winter of 2021, and into the spring of this year.  Although the castle operated with reduced opening hours during this time, EWSS support meant that Shannon Group did not have to close the castle completely in September 2021 for the winter season as had been previously indicated.<\/p><p>  As we all know, Covid-19 has had a huge impact on all tourism and heritage sites since the beginning of the pandemic.  However, there are grounds for optimism, as the Deputy highlighted, including a welcome increase in visitor numbers.  I understand King John's Castle is currently open on a seven-day week basis, as the Deputy stated.  My Department will continue to work with Shannon Group and the relevant Departments to ensure the transfer of King John's Castle will proceed as planned, placing it in a positive position to benefit from increased visitor numbers.<\/p><p>The Deputy made reference to the deadline of 4 April.  I assure him there is ongoing engagement between my Department, the Department of Transport, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage around that funding gap and there are meetings.  We have asked the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to engage with us to see what we can do to try to bridge that funding gap.  Officials from my Department are meeting with their counterparts in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media today.  We have had previous meetings.

I want to see that King John's Castle can now grow further.  There were 111,000 people coming through the gates annually, which is a huge number.  I think that is only the start.  The fact that we now have an opportunity and Limerick City and County Council is preparing, through Discover Limerick, a strategic plan for growing tourism in Limerick city involving King John's Castle is something I very much welcome.  I look forward to a conclusion of the discussions so that we have absolute certainty.  Finally, I compliment the 14 staff.

We have a serious problem in County Kerry with wastewater treatment systems.  This time last year we were waiting for an announcement from Irish Water that at the end of quarter 1 we would have good news in regard to a list of villages around the county where investment would be made available for the enhancement or replacement of wastewater treatment systems and plants around the county.  In June we eventually received notification that the Kilcummin sewerage system and the Kenmare wastewater treatment plant upgrade would be included in the Irish Water capital investment plan as capital projects.  The only others to be mentioned were Fenit, or An Fhianait, and Knightstown, or An Chois, on Valentia Island.  It seemed that those wastewater treatment plants were to be included in another scheme, the small towns and villages growth programme, but the latest I have heard is that no further upgrades are anticipated under the current programme for any other small towns or villages around the county.<\/p>  <p>  In Abbeydorney, there is a huge issue with development.  Everybody knows how difficult it is to find GPs who will open surgeries in small villages.  A proposed new GP surgery, which is so badly needed and is currently operating out of a couple of rooms in a community centre, is stalled because there is no wastewater treatment system in place in Abbeydorney, despite three or four estates having been built over the past 20 years.  In Fenit money was promised in June of last year.  It is currently not possible to build more than two houses in Fenit.  A possible hotel is also proposed in anticipation of the Tralee to Fenit greenway, which is supposed to open this summer.  There is an anticipated influx of tourists and day-trippers who will go to Fenit and allow Fenit to achieve its potential.  However, without news of any movement on the wastewater treatment plant, that is not possible.<\/p>  <p>  All around the rest of the county, in Glenbeigh, Rathmore and Duagh, the lack of investment flies in the face of plans to prioritise towns and villages and to invest in communities and long-established settlements.  <\/p> <p>It is deeply frustrating when we contact planners about a proposed development, whether it is residential or commercial, and time and again we are told that we have to get a report from Irish Water and that people who are applying for planning permission must obtain that report before the investment or development can take place.  In Castlegregory, which is right beside the sea, the system is no more than a holding tank, which is a large septic tank about 100 yd from the sea.  It is completely unacceptable from an environmental, residential, and developmental point of view.<\/p> <p> In the past, when Kerry County Council had control and responsibility for water, it carried out works on treatment plants in Castleisland, Dingle, Listowel, Cahersiveen, Ballybunion, Milltown and Tralee.  Irish Water has been working on the water system and even though I was not a fan of the establishment of Irish Water and I was against it at the time, to give credit where it is due, it has done some good work on the water system, but it is not doing enough on wastewater.  It was a mistake to take that responsibility away from Kerry County Council.  It is hard to think of a single case, be it refuse, housing, health, or orthopaedic surgeries, where a better service or a cheaper and better value service was provided when it was outsourced.  We had a list last year and we still have a totally inadequate wastewater system.  We had the Fenit announcement but we are waiting.  We had Kilcummin on a smaller scale but we are still waiting on that.

I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  This allows me the opportunity to outline the position in respect of Irish Water's responsibility on this matter.<\/p><p>The Water Services Acts 2007 to 2017 set out the arrangements in place for the delivery of water and wastewater services by Irish Water, and for the scrutiny and oversight provisions that apply in respect of these arrangements.  As the Deputy will understand, the provision of facilities in Kerry is a matter for Irish Water in the first instance.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  Irish Water takes a strategic nationwide approach to asset planning and investment and meeting customer requirements.  The prioritisation and progression of individual projects and programmes is a matter for determination by Irish Water.<\/p><p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has made inquiries with Irish Water on the issue mentioned by Deputy Daly.  Irish Water will have invested more than &euro;80 million cumulatively in water services in Kerry on more than 20 capital projects from 2014 to the end of 2024.  These include some of the good projects referred to by the Deputy earlier.  These capital projects are targeted at improved quality and capacity improvements.  There are currently two Irish Water capital projects in the planning stage, which the Deputy referred to, including the Kenmare wastewater treatment plant and the Kilcummin wastewater network, which will aim to protect the environment and quality of receiving waters, increase capacity, and facilitate future growth.<\/p><p>Irish Water's investment under the national leakage reduction programmes or capital maintenance programmes that are targeted at maintenance and replacement of assets to improve levels of service is not included in that &euro;80 million figure.<\/p><p>In addition to the investment just detailed, there are projects now progressing as part of the small towns and villages programme in Fenit and Knightstown, which the Deputy also mentioned.  Irish Water has an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for its small towns and villages growth programme.  To date, Irish Water has announced 37 projects across 27 local authority areas.  There is also further investment in leakage reduction and mains rehabilitation of  &euro;22 million since 2017.  More general information on Irish Water investment is available from the capital investment plan explanatory document, which is available on the Irish Water website,<i>www.water.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>The Government is aware that significant and sustainable investment is needed to ensure the continued operation, upgrade and repair of the country's water and wastewater infrastructure, and to support economic growth in the years to come.  In this regard, as part of budget 2022 the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has secured funding of more than &euro;1.57 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.459 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, will support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and will support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000007#E00200","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"speech","time":1648630320,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I took some notes on what the Minister of State said and while the amount of investment is welcome, it does not seem to be translating into any proposed developments for the towns and villages I mentioned.  Is Castlegregory going to have to wait?  When the Fenit project was announced last year, it said it was a five-year programme.  Is that programme still going ahead?  Does the Minister of State have any information about that?  If he does not have the information here perhaps he will get it to me.

With the small towns and villages programme, it seems there are only two proposed for Kerry.  I do not believe this is enough in a county that suffers from peripherality.  The programme for Government is supposed to enhance the small smaller towns and villages to bring people in, to move away from one-off rural development and bring people into villages.  There seems to be a complete contradiction between what is in the programme for Government and what is being delivered on the ground.  Nothing has been delivered on the ground for the people in Glenbeigh, Abbeydorney, Duagh and Rathmore.  There seems to be a lot of money invested but if I had my way it would be given back to Kerry County Council which could co-ordinate the whole project.  Water services in the county were moved to a specific place in Castleisland.  Expertise was built up over many years and was in one place, but now there is too much pulling and dragging.  There does not seem to be a co-ordinated approach.  It is deeply frustrating for the people who are in those villages, for those who cannot develop and for those who cannot move back from the cities given the opportunities now for remote working.  That is being hindered by the lack of investment in those places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000007#E00600","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1648630320,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the follow-on remarks on the provision of water treatment facilities in County Kerry.  I assure him the Government is committed to ensuring substantial funding is provided to Irish Water, as I outlined in my response.  The programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water's capital investment plan for water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis.  This is very important because we know that in the past, particularly for a local authorities and others, having a deadline whereby money had to be spent by the end of the year does not lead to good value for money.  In addition, the National Development Plan 2021-2030 commits to almost &euro;6 billion in capital investment by Irish Water in the period 2021 to 2025, of which more than &euro;4.5 billion will be voted expenditure funding for domestic water services.<\/p>  <p>  We are making progress on the challenges we face, and the Government will continue to deliver strongly on the commitments to water services contained in the programme for Government.  The Deputy will understand that the progress of individual wastewater plants and infrastructure is a matter for Irish Water.  As we modernise our infrastructure, it is inevitable that capacity constraints will arise in certain locations.  The funding provided by this Government is ensuring water and wastewater infrastructure investment is supporting the Government's overall housing targets.  I am assured by Irish Water that it is also committed to this agenda and that it will work closely with local authorities to ensure local development plan-led priorities are aligned as much as possible.<\/p>  <p>  It may be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

Many people believe Ireland's neutrality is protected in the Constitution because there is a long understanding and overwhelming support for the idea that Ireland should be neutral but, in fact, that neutrality is not protected in the Constitution, and we believe it is seriously under attack.<\/p><p>Successive Governments have sought to undermine that neutrality most egregiously with the decisions of previous Governments to allow millions of US troops to go through Shannon Airport in order to prosecute bloody and unjustifiable wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a war based on a pack of lies about weapons of mass destruction that led to the death of 1 million people, directly and indirectly, and essentially destroyed Iraqi society, damage from which it will probably not recover for decades if ever.  Ireland facilitated that even though it is supposed to be a neutral country.  We facilitated the outrageous practice of rendition, better termed as kidnapping and torture by the US, whereby they send Gulfstream jets around the world, kidnap people they consider to be a threat to American security, without due process, and take them to black sites around the world and torture them, often in despotic, brutal regimes that allow the US to carry on this practice.<\/p><p>Most recently, the Government sought to exploit the terrible crisis in Ukraine, what is undoubtedly a bloody imperialist and murderous war that has been initiated by Vladimir Putin.  The Government and the wider European political establishment are seeking to exploit that terrible crisis in order to justify moving towards greater EU militarisation, the establishment of a European army, and closer alignment with NATO.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, said recently that neutrality is a policy issue that can change at any time.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, said, &quot;I think we&rsquo;ll need to think about deeper involvement in European Defence.&quot;  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has suggested that we need to spend more resources on defence as well as co-operate with other EU countries and partnerships with NATO in some areas.  That is what he was reported as having said at a meeting he attended in the United States.  He can respond to that suggestion during the debate.  He has also said that we may get involved in the expanded rapid reaction force of 5,000 troops, which is essentially the embryo of a European army.<\/p><p>Ireland's neutrality and the struggle for an independent Irish republic are one and the same, they always have been.  To move away from Ireland's neutrality is not just some sort of interesting tactical or strategic choice.  It is, in fact, a betrayal of the essential struggle to establish an independent republic, going back to Wolfe Tone, who first advocated for both Irish independence and neutrality, and to James Connolly and those who led people out in 1916 and the entire Irish revolution.  As soon as the First World War broke out, James Connolly established the Irish Neutrality League to argue that Ireland should in no way be a participant or supporter of either warring side in the First World War.  At the time he wrote something that echoes strongly today.  He wrote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tShould the working class of Europe rather than slaughter each other for the benefit of kings and financiers, proceed ... to erect barricades all over Europe, to break up bridges and destroy the transport service that war might be abolished, we should be perfectly justified in following such a glorious example and contributing our aid to the final dethronement of the vulture classes that rule and rob the world. <\/blockquote>  <p>Brilliant and so correct.  They had vulture funds robbing the world then, just as we have now.  Connolly was clear.  As soon as that war broke out, when people in Irish politics, in the Home Rule Party, argued that Irish people could be, and they were, slaughtered in that war Connolly said &quot;No&quot;.  He said that Ireland opposed both sides in that war.  In fact, it was the outbreak of the First World War, which led to the slaughter of 14 million people, that prompted Connolly to say that we had to have a rebellion in Ireland, not just for independence but to strike a blow against empires and the slaughter of the First World War.  The Irish revolution was significantly accelerated by the conscription crisis of 1918.  Upon the end of the war, the Irish revolution was part of a series of revolutions across Europe, in Russia, Germany, France and so on, against the war, a slaughter that was ended by the revolt of working people against all the warmongers of Europe.  People Before Profit-Solidarity believe we have to uphold that tradition which is now under serious threat.<\/p><p>Neutrality does not mean indifference.  Neutrality means standing against warmongers and empires and standing with the oppressed.  If we throw that away, we will throw away what is the identity that was the struggle for the Irish Republic, and we will do so at our peril.  We should not do that and I hope the House will support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000008#F00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1648630920,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The media reports that the Government opposes the Bill on the basis that it is \"unnecessary\".

Perhaps many people assume it is unnecessary because they believe neutrality is already enshrined in the Constitution, which it is not, or the reason the Government believes it is unnecessary is that it is saying \"Do not worry; there is no threat to neutrality from this Government\".  The evidence is very clearly to the contrary.  The Taoiseach who leads the Government, as per his own words of two or three weeks ago, explicitly stated that neutrality is a policy issue that can change at any time.

We will not have a referendum - I thank the Minister for the confirmation - before the Government decides to send working-class young people from this country abroad to serve in a European military operation.  Do we get a commitment from the Government before it abandons even the triple lock?  This acts as a certain restriction on its ability to, again, send working-class people to fight elsewhere in the world and it is even in the programme for Government, but for which the Minister has floated the idea of the need to be rid of it.  Will we have a referendum before that is ditched?<\/p>  <p>  The truth is the Government and its outriders, such as commentators, are engaged in a propaganda war against what is left of neutrality - independence from military alliances.  It is presented as if this is a new thing and a necessary, mature response to the horrendous, brutal, criminal invasion of Ukraine by Putin whereas the reality is this is not a new position.  It is not a new position from us to say that Ireland should not participate in military alliances, and to propose a law, that we should not use Shannon Airport to transport more than 2.5 million US troops to the Middle East. <\/p>  <p>  It is also not a new position from the political establishment to try to erode neutrality.  In 2003, Fine Gael proposed in a policy document, Beyond Neutrality, to move towards supporting participation in a common EU defence policy, abandoning the so-called triple-lock mechanism and describing it as a political straitjacket.  At the time, John Bruton said \"You cannot create a political union and then say you are not prepared to defend it.  That is logical. ...the Taoiseach should now start preparing Irish public opinion for ... [that].\"  The T&aacute;naiste has regularly paraphrased this \"Europe worth defending\" line.  Let us not kid ourselves that this latest push to fully undermine and get rid of this political straitjacket and to undermine neutrality is a mere pragmatic response to the war in Ukraine.  Instead, it is shock doctrine in action to use a real crisis - a horrendous invasion and humanitarian catastrophe - to try to drive a pre-existing ideological agenda from Fianna F&aacute;il and, in particular, Fine Gael.  It has now just reached its most extreme point of the Government feeling confident to almost totally do away with neutrality and raise the idea of joining with NATO.<\/p>  <p>  The important point is that NATO is being rebranded as some sort of peace force as if it was simply the neutral teacher on the playground stopping the bullies.  Tell that to the ordinary people of Afghanistan whose country was invaded and occupied by NATO for years.  Who gave NATO or the US the right to consider themselves the world police?  The people of Iraq, more than 1 million of whom died at the hands of the US invasion, must be left wondering if their suffering at the hands of NATO members has been completely forgotten.  When we say \"neutrality\", we do not mean neutral is not being on the side of the oppressed against the oppressor.  We say we should take the side of the oppressed against the oppressor.  What we mean, and what is outlined in our Bill, is that Ireland should stand up against invasion, war and imperialism.  We should be a voice for justice and the rights of nations to self-determination, especially given our history of colonial oppression.  To do that with any credibility, we must not join any of the imperialist clubs, such as the US-led NATO or the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation.<\/p>  <p>  We propose that people be given a choice.  The Government wants to do away fully with neutrality, and any semblance left of it, behind the backs of the people.  It has cut away at it again and again, making a joke of it when it comes to the use of Shannon Airport, but we say have the debate.  Let us have the debate publicly, allow people to decide, and give them a chance to vote to block the Government from joining NATO or any other imperialist alliance as well as blocking participation in a European process of militarisation.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a point to the Green Party, although no Deputies from that party are present.  The Green Party leader, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has voted to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution on three previous occasions in 2003, 2016 and 2018.  The question of neutrality is very clearly in the Green Party manifesto.  What will its members do?  Will they stick to their principles, or supposed principles, stick to what was decided by their membership regarding what is in its election manifesto and stick to the promises made to the electorate or will they, as on so many other issues, fold under the pressure of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the drums of militarisation and the complete abandonment of neutrality?  I do not have time to give the many quotes from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on neutrality, which would be very appropriate and would indicate he should be on this side of the debate rather than backing up the militarisation agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000009#G00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1648631520,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Our neutrality should never be confused with the idea of Ireland being indifferent or uninterested in world affairs or indifferent to the suffering of oppressed peoples globally.  A constant snide attack on those of us on the left who are on this side of the House has often been how obsessed we are with far-flung conflicts and the plight of oppressed people in other parts of the world, for which we are often criticised and slagged off.  That is why we stood with Black Lives Matter, why we protested against Donald Trump, why we marched against the war in Iraq, and why we highlighted and opposed the brutal thugs and dictators, wherever they came from, be it Saudi Arabia, China, Burma and Egypt.

That is not to detract at all from the suffering of the Ukrainian people.  We are not neutral when it comes to human solidarity and opposing warmongers and dictators of any colour or creed.  As has been said, we are always on the side of the oppressed.

Whatever about our concern regarding the double standards when it comes to the treatment of refugees, it is nothing compared with the revulsion we feel when we hear commentators and Deputies salivating at the thought of Ireland growing up and joining NATO or some NATO-aligned military set-up.  We need a version of mature debate without showing our willingness to send off young men and women to die in foreign fields.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness to the Minister's party, and others who have been consistent, it has never hidden its desire to ditch neutrality.  Neither has Fianna F&aacute;il, when it has inventively ignored the policy of neutrality whenever the opportunity arose.  For that party, neutrality was more honoured in the breach than the observance.  That inventiveness has meant genuflecting to neutrality, while also doing whatever it wanted in many cases.  Article 28 of the Constitution states: \"War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.\"  Despite that, the inventiveness of this establishment's attitude to neutrality has meant acceding to whatever whims the US empire has had.  If it wanted to move 3 million troops through Shannon in pursuit of criminal wars, it was told to go ahead.  It has also meant the following: joining permanent structured co-operation; Ireland joining the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan in 2001; Irish troops being deployed on NATO-led missions in Europe in 2017; Ireland joining NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1999; Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael voting against a Bill to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution in 2003; and co-operating with rendition flights, turning a blind eye to the horrors of western-backed regimes, such as the Saudis, and promising to bump up military expenditure and co-ordination with the European Union and NATO armaments and hardware.<\/p> <p>Our traditional policy of neutrality, like many other traditions, has always been seen by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il as something that it is useful to genuflect to from time to time but which can always be rendered redundant when it is convenient.  We have now discovered that the horrors of the Russian invasion have given the Government the right to ditch that genuflection to neutrality.  It has now professed that alliance must mean full-blown support for NATO or another European Union alliance.  The only problem, of course, is that the Government intends to march us to war under future alliances without giving the people of this country a say in the matter via a referendum.  It is imperative that we have a mature debate.  The Minister said we need to have mature debate.  Let us do so and let us also have a referendum.<\/p> <p> I appeal, as Deputy Paul Murphy did, to the Green Party.  I call on it to live by its conscience and principles, if it still has them, and refuse to vote against this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000009#G00500","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632120,"counter":46,"content":"<p>If copies of my speech are not already in the Chamber, they will be shortly.<\/p><p>For today's debate, we first need to clarify what we mean when we talk about Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality.  In practical terms, and as practised by successive Governments for many decades, the policy means that Ireland does not participate in military alliances, nor in common or mutual defence arrangements.  As the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions in recent weeks, military neutrality does not mean we are politically or morally neutral.  Neutrality has never stopped us participating in world events nor, self-evidently, from being affected by them.  It does not mean that we are inactive in situations where we see flagrant breaches of the UN charter and clear violations of international law, including international humanitarian law.  <\/p><p>Addressing our D&aacute;il in 1963, John F. Kennedy observed that Ireland pursues an independent course in foreign policy but it is not neutral between liberty and tyranny, and never will be.  Archbishop Desmond Tutu said, &quot;If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.&quot;  That is the approach we take.<\/p><p>For more than 60 years, not a day has passed when Ireland's peacekeepers were not on duty in blue helmets somewhere across the world.  Our Defence Forces' record of continuous service is the longest of any UN member state and, with more than 500 Permanent Defence Force personnel serving as peacekeepers today, our contribution to UN peacekeeping is Europe's highest <i>per capita<\/i>and sixth highest globally.  We have also actively shaped and contributed to the development of the UN's common security and defence policy, and we are significant contributors to UN-mandated and EU-led crisis management missions around the world.  Ireland was among the member states that championed the development of a civilian as well as a military crisis management capability by the EU so that today we have Irishmen and Irishwomen advising on policing and security sector reform, border management, judicial reform, human rights and gender policies, and cybersecurity and hybrid threats in Georgia, Iraq, Kosovo, Ukraine, Somalia, Libya, Niger and the Central African Republic.  Ireland was also to the forefront of designing a new European peace facility which allows for the strengthening of military and defence capabilities of partners and supports the military aspect of peace support operations, notably those carried out by the African Union and other regional organisations.  Ireland ensured that the facility was designed in such a way that countries which did not wish to finance or provide lethal weaponry as part of measures adopted under the peace facility could instead finance non-lethal and protective equipment.  We have seen this work in practice in the crisis in Ukraine, where Ireland's share of &euro;22 million of the &euro;1 billion support package to the Ukrainian military has gone solely on non-lethal equipment and support.<\/p><p>In the view of the Government, the Bill we are discussing would serve to seriously undermine our proactive international role.  Indeed, the Bill would be likely to curtail Ireland's efforts to contribute to international peace and security, rather than in any way enhance it.  On this basis, the Government opposes the Bill.  I will outline a number of our key concerns.  The Bill could constrain the Executive's ability to exercise its authority in respect of the conduct of international relations, as already articulated in Article 29 of the Constitution.  In particular, the Bill, if enacted, could constrain the Government's scope to participate in UN peacekeeping missions, particularly missions with a mandate under chapter 7 of the UN charter, which is a peace-enforcement mandate.  The same would hold true for UN-mandated and EU-led or NATO-led peacekeeping or crisis management missions.  Currently, the main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 344 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in Syria, with 132 personnel.  Other missions include the UN-mandated and NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo, with 13 personnel; the EU-led Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzogovina, with five personnel; and the EU-led training mission in Mali, with 20 personnel.  These missions are undertaken in pursuit of the UN principles of making international peace and security, taking collective measures to prevent and remove threats to peace and protect civilians.  In apparently seeking to prevent all military action other than defence of our own national territory, this Bill would potentially neutralise the ability of Ireland's Defence Forces to serve overseas.  It would remove, or at least significantly constrain, a pillar of our engagement in the world which has been characteristic of this State for 75 years.<\/p><p>The Bill, as presented, could also potentially go a step further and preclude even the provision of non-lethal equipment and support to regional organisations, such as the African Union, or to third-country partners, such as Ukraine, through our participation in the European peace facility.  It could prevent a current or future Irish Government from using the instruments and tools at our disposal, either bilaterally or through the EU, to give practice expression to our foreign policy.  To be blunt, it would prevent us putting our money where our mouth is.<\/p><p>The Bill also purports to provide constitutional guarantees that the State shall not allow its territory to be used by other states to transport war material or personnel to third countries for the purpose of war or other armed conflict.  Everyone in this House already knows that foreign state and military aircraft that are permitted to land at Irish airports, including Shannon Airport, must comply with strict conditions.  These include routine stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, and must not engage in intelligence gathering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000010#H00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632120,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Yeah, right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000010#H00300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632120,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The flights in question must not form any part of military exercises or operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000010#H00400","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632120,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Pull the other one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000010#H00500","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1648632120,"counter":50,"content":"<p>These conditions are applied to all international partners and are not specific to individual states.  They will continue to be applied.  Moreover, as Deputies will be aware, there are already provisions in the Constitution that underpin Ireland's foreign and security policy framework.  In particular, Article 29 establishes the framework within which Ireland conducts its international relations.  For example, Article 29.1 states, &quot;Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.&quot;  Article 29.2 confirms that Ireland adheres to the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes.  Article 29.4.9&deg; sets out that, &quot;The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty of the European Union where that common defence would include the State.&quot;  Indeed, the protocols attaching to the Lisbon treaty specifically recognised Ireland's policy of military neutrality, stating <i>inter alia<\/i>, &quot;The Lisbon Treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.&quot;<\/p><p>Of course, international deployments of the Defence Forces other than for humanitarian purposes are subject to the triple lock of a UN mandate, Government approval and in the case of deployments of more than 12 personnel, D&aacute;il approval.<\/p><p>I will add a few words about the current international and geopolitical context.  We are living in completely unprecedented times.  Russia's appalling actions in Ukraine demonstrate an utter disregard for international law, the UN charter and Europe's collective security architecture, including Russia's own commitments under the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.<\/p> <p>We need a fresh conversation here in Ireland about our own approach to security and defence, a mature and honest debate about the world that is and Ireland's place in it today.  The Taoiseach has already made clear that Ireland's neutrality is fundamentally a policy decision.  He has indicated that the issues involved could, at an appropriate time, be discussed through a citizens' assembly or a similar framework.  To an extent, part of this conversation has already begun through the work of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  We have already had a long debate on that commission and I suspect we will have more.<\/p> <p> It is important these conversations are allowed to take place in an open and evidence-based way and at an appropriate time.  Inserting provisions now into the Constitution on military neutrality without allowing for a serious discussion of the threat environment Ireland and its EU partners now face and the appropriate response to that threat simply closes off that conversation before it has properly even begun.  This is the context in which the Government opposes this Bill and the constitutional amendments proposed here by the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000010#H00600","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648632720,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I will begin my contribution with a personal reminiscence.  I remember a crowd of kids standing out on the sidewalk, as we used to say, on the street corner in Columbus, Ohio.  I think the year was probably 1970, which would place me at age six or seven.  There was a big conversation and it was all about the so-called crazy kid who lived around the corner.  We were convinced this teenager was crazy because he had decided to go for a little walk right off the roof of his mother's garage.  Inevitably, he broke his legs, so as far as we were concerned he was crazy.  Of course he was not, because in doing so he escaped the draft, avoided Vietnam, possibly saved his own life and he probably saved the lives of others.  It was only years later I realised what was going on and that maybe to be crazy in a crazy world makes a person one of the sanest of the sane.<\/p><p>Since then I have read many history books and I have studied a few wars, including that particular war in which 58,000 US soldiers died and in which 3 million Vietnamese people died.  That reading, study and maybe a few childhood experiences such as that - it was not the only one -  brings me to a point in this D&aacute;il where I approach this discussion as a socialist opponent of imperialist war and militarism and as a person who casts a very sceptical eye on the pronouncements and propaganda of capitalist spokespersons on these issues.<\/p><p>The Irish State has never been a genuinely neutral State.  It was neutral in the Second World War, and maybe more so than some other wars, but on the side of America and Britain.  It was neutral in the Vietnam war on the side of Uncle Sam.  It was so neutral in the Iraq war that Shannon Airport was given over as a refuelling pit stop for the American war machine.<\/p><p>This State came into being on the back of a counter-revolution that overpowered a revolution which had been driven by the working class and the poor for both national and social liberation.  The revolutionary movement of 1917 to 1923 was so powerful that the leaders of the new State felt they had to tip the hat to its most dearly held sentiments.  Clearly, a mass movement that had challenged the power of an empire had created a strong anti-imperialist sentiment in the country.  Hence the official policy of the leaders of the new State was neutrality with no overt connections with imperialist power blocs, but unofficially it was to give as much political and, where possible, practical support to such blocs.  Such has been the hypocrisy of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Irish capitalist class down through the decades that only now, with the Russian invasion, do they dare to lower the mask and reveal their real ambitions more fully.<\/p><p>Socialists are not neutral on issues of foreign policy either.  In the battle between the black South African masses and apartheid capitalism, they were unequivocally on the side of those masses.  In the struggle between the Iraqi people and the US invaders, who were gifted Shannon, our sympathies were on the side not of some of the factions but of the Iraqi people themselves.  Similarly, in the struggle between the people of Ukraine and Putin's invading army we stand 100% on the side of the Ukrainian people, support their right to armed self-defence and resistance, and call for the immediate withdrawal of all Russian troops.<\/p><p>As a socialist I support this Bill because it seeks to tie the hands of capitalist governments in the State, to restrict their ability to make military alliances, and to restrict their ability to declare war, allowing this only in circumstances where the country has been invaded and only then by way of a decision of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I also support it because it asks for ratification of that position by way of referendum, placing the decision in the hands of the people rather than those who want to strengthen Ireland's military muscle whether they be in the Cabinet or the editorial rooms of the capitalist press.<\/p><p>What would a European army or rapid reaction force look like?  You might get a glimpse of this if you looked at what is happening today in Africa.  A leaked document from the European Union-African Union Summit earlier this year stated the EU wants to scale up its military presence in Africa.  The document describes Europe's existing military deployments in Africa as stretching\u00a0from the Sahel to the Gulf of Guinea, and from the Horn of Africa to the Mozambique canal, which echoes 19th century imperialist talk.  The <i>EUobserver<\/i>states the EU currently has 11 military and naval missions in Africa.  Many of these missions are led by France in west Africa, which is where France was formerly the direct colonial power.  All of them serve to prop up pro-EU governments as the EU battles for influence on the continent with the rival imperialisms of China and Russia.  The aim of the exercise is not so much to protect democracy.  It is to protect sources of cheap minerals and cheap labour.

The Vietnam war, which I spoke of at the outset, was defeated by a pincer movement with key resistance by the Vietnamese people and the US anti-war movement.  The Stalinist dictatorships of eastern Europe were toppled not by NATO tanks but by people power.  The beginning of the end of the First World War was protests and strikes by Russian workers on the streets, which toppled a Tsar and went on to defeat capitalism.  The key to defeating Putin's war lies with the resistance of the Ukrainian people and the actions of the Russian anti-war movement itself.  By the way, the more NATO is involved, the more Putin is strengthened at home, as seen with the comments regarding regime change that were made by Biden in Poland at the weekend.<\/p>  <p>  I want to say a word about those, including the Minister, who want to increase military spending in this country.  I want to see more spending on pay and conditions for Defence Forces members.  We defend the interests of Defence Forces members, despite the comments of the Minister earlier.<\/p> <p>I want this country to be secure from cyberattacks.  There is a certain hypocrisy in Fine Gael Ministers highlighting the issue of cybersecurity when Fine Gael's underfunding of the HSE's security system for years and years left it open not just to attack but to being crippled last year.  If more money is needed to defend the likes of the HSE's computer system, that is no problem.<\/p> <p> Nevertheless, I am totally opposed to massive increases in spending on arms and the weapons of war.  The PESCO target of spending 2% of GDP on military would bring Irish military spending to &euro;3.6 billion.  The Minister does not support that position at this point but he might think about what we could do with &euro;3.6 billion.  Let us look at the cost of living crisis and the rising prices of oil, food and fuel.  A total of 70% of Irish households could be given a cheque for &euro;1,000 each to offset those fuel and food price increases.  That is how we will fight this campaign, namely, with class politics.  We will make the point we need money for our nurses, our health system and housing, not to be spending on arms.<\/p> <p> The Minister stated there is a good chance Ireland will be involved in the rapid reaction force.

Much can be said of the historical antecedents that have been used to underpin the principle of neutrality and the strong currents of support that neutrality has enjoyed in this country.  They provide a strong foundation for contemporary arguments in favour of military neutrality.  Today we take our place in a world that exists amid a geopolitical storm.  The rules that have traditionally provided stability and order for the international system have been torn asunder by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.  Amid the chaos, there are those seeking to take advantage of this human tragedy and to reawaken from the cold sleep of forced hibernation old, tired, and worn-out arguments for the abandonment of Irish neutrality.  This is all in the hope the natural empathy, compassion and sense of identity of the people with the cause of the oppressed against an imperial aggressor would cause us to give leave of our senses and join them in their jingoism.  I reject the arguments of those who would have us abandon our neutrality and surrender our sovereignty.  The people, too, reject these arguments, evidenced in opinion poll after opinion poll, in which time and again they have asserted their support for military neutrality.<\/p>  <p>  I believe in Irish neutrality.  I believe our Defence Forces need to be given the means to guarantee our military neutrality.  I believe the exemplary record of the Defence Forces in support of United Nations peacekeeping missions has not only provided a vital contribution to global humanitarian projects but has acted as a major contributor to the international esteem in which our country is held.  Women and men in our Defence Forces represent some of the very best of what our nation has to offer in terms of patriotism, sacrifice and commitment to democratic ideals, yet Government after Government has failed them utterly.  They have marginalised them and undermined their democratic right to participate in collective bargaining, as is the right of many militaries of the EU.  Successive Governments have stood by as the strength of our Defence Forces has been decimated through neglect.  Under the Government, our country is dependent on other states to guarantee the security of our seas and skies.  The international order, the new Europe, needs to be rebuilt with imagination and diplomacy, not military posturing.  Ireland is uniquely positioned to play a critical role in these efforts.  By enshrining the principle of neutrality in our Constitution, we will codify the principles, the characteristics and the record of what it is to be Irish in the eyes of the international arena.<\/p>  <p>  Many nations are qualified to wage war, but precious few have the qualifications, the record or the standing to act as the builders of peace.  Rather than view neutrality as a retreat from international responsibilities, I view active neutrality as a means for the Irish nation to advance its contribution to international affairs and to reverse the current circumstances in which Ireland struggles to meet our UN mandate.  The pursuit of a policy of active neutrality allows us to amalgamate the contributions of factors that have established the essence of Irish soft power on the international stage.  The peacekeeping record of our Defence Forces, the humanitarian record of our NGOs and the influential record of our diplomatic service have contributed to the establishment of an Irish identity in global affairs, an identity that allows Ireland access and credibility in dealing with international issues that is denied to other nations whose past and current configuration leaves them better prepared for war. <\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000012#K00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1648633320,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Ireland's position of military neutrality is an honourable tradition.

That has been burned into the minds of the Irish people ever since, such that when we achieved independence for 26 of our 32 counties, we would be separated from imperialism and empire and we would have our own, independent foreign policy.  That approach over the decades has served us well but, let us be honest, it has been undermined again and again by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael-led Governments.<\/p>  <p>  An independent foreign policy and military neutrality give Ireland the unique opportunity to be honest brokers in conflict resolution throughout the world.

We need to learn from all the conflicts of recent times that if Ireland had a Government that truly believed in active neutrality, we could play a significant role in conflict resolution internationally, and more so than we have done.  We have not taken the opportunity.  We have not built on the considerable respect for the peacekeepers in our Defence Forces, of whom we are immensely proud.

That is because I am convinced our geopolitical, security and defence interests are best served by not being part of any military alliance.  Because of that role, Irish Governments, historically, have had a stronger hand in the promotion of diplomacy, de-escalation and conflict resolution, and our Defence Forces have played a very proud role in UN peacekeeping missions.<\/p> <p>That is why I, like many others, do not support Ireland joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.  That organisation, in many of its members&rsquo; roles in recent conflicts in modern times, speaks for itself.<\/p> <p> I also have a genuine concern with the proposition and ongoing debate around an EU common defence.  Unlike some people, I have been clear that the advance of an EU common defence has been incredibly slow.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  That speaks to the fact that the geopolitical, strategic and defence interests of the member states of the European Union are not aligned.  Ours, in particular, are not aligned with many of the more powerful interests that would be the driving forces behind such a common defence.  While to date progress, as some would see it, on that front has been limited, I am genuinely concerned that the appalling, unjustified and illegal war that is currently taking place by Russia in Ukraine is being used by some to try and advance a separate EU common defence agenda.  That is something I, as well as other colleagues, strongly oppose.<\/p> <p> My strong view, and I think the Minister agrees with some of this, is that we should be spending far more time on promoting the reform of the United Nations and on strengthening the role of the United Nations so that it can become an even better player on the international stage to advance many of the issues in which the Minister himself is directly involved in his position on the UN Security Council.  These are the key issues of conflict resolution, de-escalation and peacekeeping.  That is where our efforts, and indeed those of our European partners, should be and not on a common defence.<\/p> <p> The one area on which I agree with the Minister is that we should have a reasoned and evidence-based debate.  I can think of no better way of doing that than in a referendum, as we showed through marriage equality and repeal.  It is on that basis I am wholeheartedly supporting this call for a referendum and participating in the debate that follows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000012#K00400","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648633920,"counter":70,"content":"<p>At the outset, I offer my support and my sympathy to the people of Ukraine in the face of the vicious war of aggression caused by the illegal Russian invasion.  I also thank the Deputies who have brought this Bill to the floor of the House and who have given us the opportunity to have this very important debate.  Many progressive Deputies down through the years, including some of whom have been in my own party, have produced similar Bills to enshrine our neutrality into the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  On these occasions, those politicians have been castigated.  They have been lectured by successive governments, which say our State's position as a militarily neutral country is safe and we do not need constitutional protection.  Unfortunately, in recent weeks, we have seen some politicians in this House, in particular in the Upper House, opportunistically trying to push for Ireland to join military alliances, such as NATO or an EU army.  These same few politicians were joined by a chorus of voices in the opinion pages of our newspapers and across the airwaves expounding the values of militarisation, safe, as always, in the knowledge that it will not be their kids who are called up to be conscripted into any army.  It will be the sons and the daughters of ordinary, working people who will have to suffer that.<\/p>  <p>  I have a picture on my phone of my grandfather in his British Army uniform.  In my own family, we have had men who were forced to join armies and fight in wars.  At the age of 14, my father's father joined the British Army.  He was 14 years of age.  He did not want to go to war.  He just wanted money.  He wanted a job.  He wanted work.  He was forced into the army.  My father, my grandfather and my great-grandfather died too young.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure there will be plenty of faux outrage when I say, though we all know it, it is mainly middle-aged, middle-class men who are banging the drum of militarisation and of abandoning our neutrality.  These people seem to think war is easy and somehow it is better or simpler than peace.  This is not the case and it never, ever has been.  We should never give up the pursuit of peace.  We should be proud of our peacekeeping and of our reputation abroad, as has been mentioned previously.  We should never abandon that position.

It is not right that prominent Ministers are undermining neutrality and drawing our nation to the military alliances through their support of the EU defence policies, thus leading into the funding of the arms industry.  This, I may add, is against the wishes of the Irish nation and its citizens and is thus eroding our esteemed peacekeeping reputation and our extensive experience in conflict resolution around the world.<\/p>  <p>  No one has the right to sell our neutrality and to negotiate our neutrality without the full, democratic consent of the people.  This is a position we have held for centuries.  We are a small nation and we have never invaded any other country.  That is a sacrosanct and noble position to hold.  We listen to the arguments of our own Taoiseach, Ministers and MEPs that we must evolve and change with the times and that neutrality must also be part of that change.  This is an alarming warning sign of the Government&rsquo;s intentions to erode our neutral status.  It must be challenged every step of the way and it will be challenged every step of the way.

Ireland&rsquo;s peacekeeping missions go back over 64 years.  We proudly hold the longest, unbroken record of any nation in the world.  This is a tradition of which Irish people are very proud.  We must play our part with promoting peace throughout the world.  We must offer every humanitarian assistance to our suffering neighbours.  However, we must remain steadfast in our neutrality and remain as we have done for the past 64 years, as a United Nations peacekeeping force that is respected throughout the Far East and around the world.

This legislation seeks to provide that the State shall not participate in any war or other armed conflict, nor aid foreign powers in any way in the preparation for war.<\/p>  <p>  Several opinion polls that have been conducted, including one in the middle of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, have clearly indicated that there remains an overwhelming level of support for Ireland&rsquo;s position of neutrality.

They were most recently involved in horrific wars in Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and many African countries.  Let us be clear, and it has been stated already, it will not be the children of the proponents of military alliances who are sent to war zones, based on lies such as those relating to the Iraq war.

The recent attacks on Irish neutrality that we have heard from certain Members of this House are examples of how some people get their priorities and, indeed, their ideas about Ireland&rsquo;s role in this world wrong.  The main priority in this current situation must be to bring the war in Ukraine to an end.  Indeed, that should be our focus when it comes to every armed struggle and conflict across the globe.  When it comes to Ukraine, ending the conflict means securing the withdrawal of Russia.  The best way for that to be done for the people of Ukraine is through diplomacy and our ability to impose sanctions, thus isolating the aggressor, which in this case is Russia.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to those who may question our neutrality in current times, let me ask them why they are more prepared to do that than expel the Russian ambassador.  Let me go one step further.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, who has been Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s spokesperson on public expenditure and reform since September 2020, raised on three occasions the issue of the funnelling of &euro;188 billion through the IFSC using section 110 of the tax code.  Not all options are yet being used, yet Members of this House thought it more prudent to raise concerns about Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality.  It shows the contradictory nature of comments uttered within this House by certain individuals.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Ireland's neutrality should be seen as our strength and not presented as a weakness.  We have a history of conflict resolution, despite not being a military country.  We are recognised as such and have a seat on the UN Security Council as a result.  More than that, we are the only European country on the Security Council not a member of NATO.  Furthermore, the Member who seems to have been unable to wait to question Ireland's status as a neutral country has a colleague in the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who said the following when we secured out seat on the council:<\/p><blockquote>\tOur membership of the UN has played a major part in our development. We not only support a fair rules-based order in international affairs - we exist, survive and prosper because of it.  And we see no viable alternative.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>For Ireland, multilateralism strengthens our independence, self-confidence and security, rather than diminishes it. <\/blockquote> <p>Our neutrality is our strength.  We are a principled nation that has global renown for its neutrality and work on conflict resolution.<br\/><br\/>What about the countries that are not neutral?  Are they glowing examples of restraint?  If you were to ask the people of Iraq, Yemen or Palestine for their views on non-neutral states, what would they have to say?As a militarily neutral state, Ireland has played an important role in peacekeeping and in the battle against nuclear proliferation.  How does that lead us to questioning our neutrality?  In a poll at the beginning of this month, three quarters of those surveyed supported maintaining neutrality.  Only 15% looked for it to be changed.  Furthermore, Ireland is well aware of the consequences of imperialism.  We know the importance of a country maintaining its sovereignty and its right of self-determination.  We need to be focused on peaceful resolutions to conflict and not exacerbating the current conflict or rescinding our principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000013#L00500","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648634520,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Speaking immediately after her election as Labour Party leader last Thursday, Deputy Bacik said the following:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am committed to Irish neutrality.<br \/><br \/>But I believe our non-aligned status isn&rsquo;t about opting out.<br \/><br \/>It has to be about opting in:<br \/><br \/>Opting into humanitarian missions, to peacekeeping, to diplomacy, and to the prosecution of war criminals.<br \/><br \/>We are not, and we never have been, neutral against barbarism and aggression.<br \/><br \/>As an internationalist party, we in Labour want Ireland to play a full role in the evolving European debate about security, a debate that must focus on protecting our democracies in the 21st century. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is the Labour Party's position and always has been.  We as a nation should remain neutral and not aligned to any military pact but enthusiastic to use our vast experience in peacekeeping, peacemaking and humanitarian relief and our diplomatic and soft international power in defence of diplomatic norms and democracy, the defence of human rights and international law.  We are immensely proud of our peacekeepers and the role the Irish military has played in the UN and wearing with pride the blue beret and blue helmet.  We are proud also of the role of our NGOs and of the history of Ireland's diplomatic activity on issues like nuclear non-proliferation.  All these matters have combined to define this nation's international standing.  It is a unique standing where we are seen internationally as honest brokers not involved in armed oppression but there to bring peace, diplomacy and relief to those who are oppressed.<\/p><p>This is a debate about a constitutional amendment so I wish to deal with what is in the Constitution at present.  It is important we do that.  Article 28.3.1&deg; states: &quot;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;.  Article 29 begins:<\/p> <blockquote> \t1 Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.<br \/><br \/>2 Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.<br \/><br \/>3 Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States. <\/blockquote>  <p>Article 29.4.9&deg; states, &quot;The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State.&quot;  That is the current position.  It merits and needs change to enshrine without doubt the neutral position I think is supported by the overwhelming majority of the people.  If I had more time, I would be able to go into that in more detail.<\/p><p>The Constitution Review Group that published its findings in May 1996 recommended one change to Article 28.3.1&deg;, namely, that reference to &quot;war&quot; be extended to include &quot;or other armed conflict&quot;.  The group recommended no other change.  The report stated that since &quot;Article 29 commits the State to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations and to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes&quot; and since Article 28.3.1&deg; establishes D&aacute;il control over the State's involvement in armed conflict, no other amendment would be necessary to retain the policy of neutrality.  The group noted, &quot;Neutrality in Ireland has always been a policy as distinct from a fundamental law or principle&quot;.  It is time we changed that policy and my party supports the notion it should be a matter of constitutional law.<\/p><p>However, concern about Irish neutrality arose from the proposed adoption of the Common Foreign and Security Policy by the EU.  This concern was, among other things, instrumental in the defeat of the first Nice treaty referendum in 2001.  The second Nice referendum was passed, as the Acting Chairman will remember, in November 2003 to insert the new Article 29.4.9&deg; I read a moment ago.  Even without Nice, it would probably have been unconstitutional for Ireland to have joined such a defence alliance.  Article 28.3.1&deg; provides, &quot;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate ... save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&quot;  Any binding commitment made in advance to commit the State to go to war in future in any unknown circumstances without first complying with domestic constitutional requirements would be an unlawful overriding of the State's sovereign discretion in that matter.  I therefore think that safeguard was already there but we needed to, and did, make it explicit.  As the power of war belongs to the Executive and the power to assent to war is vested in the D&aacute;il, it is not constitutionally possible to bind these organs in advance one way or the other, and a binding commitment never to declare war would be as unconstitutional as a commitment in a mutual defence treaty.<\/p><p>I do not have time to go into the experiences we had in the Gulf war of January 1991 and the second one and the litigation that clarified our constitutional position subsequent to that save to say that when a challenge was taken on the constitutionality of the action of Ireland in facilitating the belligerents during the second Gulf war through the use of Shannon Airport, the High Court held that what constituted participation was a matter for the D&aacute;il itself to decide.  In other words, it seems under the current law that not only does the D&aacute;il have the constitutional discretion to assent or withhold consent to participation in a war, it also gets to define the extent of its own constitutional discretion by defining what constitutes &quot;war&quot; in the first place.  These are matters that are now rightly being focused upon and require clarification.  That is why I commend the tabling of this Bill.  I have difficulties with the content of it but what is important is we agree on a form of words we can put to the people to put these matters beyond doubt.  This debate on Ireland's future with respect to the posture of our armed forces and our constitutional certainty needs clarity.<\/p>  <p>I hope that this is merely the start of a deep and profound debate to put these matters beyond doubt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000014#M00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648635120,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The Social Democrats welcome this People Before Profit Bill which provides for a referendum to properly define our neutrality stance.  As it currently stands, Articles 28 and 29 of our Constitution outline our position of neutrality.  However, the wording around the definition of neutrality is vague, to say the least.  Essentially, in the main it allows the Government of the day to determine how the country responds to threats.  Irish neutrality has been a core principle of our foreign policy since the foundation of the State.  It was clear during the referendums on both the Nice and Lisbon treaties that the Irish people continue to place enormous value on neutrality and our place in the world as peacekeepers.<\/p>  <p>  We can understand why this Bill is before us today.  The rhetoric from a number of EU leaders around common defence over the last few years and more recently by some in the Government would indicate that there is a desire to debate our position of neutrality.  This is a Parliament and to debate policy means, of course, a wish to change it and so we welcome this opportunity to make very clear that we oppose any move towards a watering down of our policy of neutrality.  <\/p>  <p>  The unfolding of a war in real time through our televisions, social media feeds, in newspapers and on radio leaves us in no doubt as to the horror and brutality of this latest war.  Of course, the war in Ukraine is one of many raging across the world today.  Our hearts go out to all of those experiencing war and armed conflict, be that in Yemen, Palestine, Afghanistan as well as in Ukraine and many other countries.  Thousands have already died and millions are now displaced.  Women and children are fleeing their homes through unsafe humanitarian corridors, sometimes crossing multiple borders to reach safety.  It is estimated that 6.7 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced and 3 million are seeking refuge elsewhere.  There are those who, by choice or conscription, are left behind to defend their communities, democracy and independence against a brutal regime waging an illegal and unjust war.  We have watched as the Russian army has attacked civilians, mothers and babies in maternity hospitals, people with disabilities in residential care, medical staff and journalists.  Putin has broken almost every international law that governs the rules of war.  Countless war crimes have already been committed but it remains unclear just how far Putin will go or where and when this will end.  It is a frightening time for the people of Ukraine and Russia and for the rest of the world.  I am very conscious, as we talk here about being anti-war, that this is not a luxury being afforded to the people on the streets of Mariupol or Kyiv at this time.  We are horrified to witness such brutality.<\/p>  <p>  It is not so long ago that Ireland also experienced the horror of invasion and illegal occupation.  The collective memory on this island is one of the trauma of colonisation that is still with us today.  As a small country, we have endured war, violence and colonisation for centuries.  It is important to assert that Ireland has never acted as the aggressor and has never been an oppressor.  The very history of this country is one of fear of the threat of invasion and conquest by foreign forces.  It is actually a luxury in the context of Irish history that we no longer have such a fear.  The British playbook on how to wage war and how to oppress a native population, with such tactics used by them and others successfully all round the world, was written in the blood of the Irish people.  The British empire trialled ways to keep the native population down, determined to destroy our autonomy, language, education and culture.  We know only too well the detrimental impact that this has had, and continues to have, on our shared island.  <\/p>  <p>  Our peace here was hard won and came at great cost.  It remains as fragile as ever.  There are constant efforts in the background to ensure that our peace lasts.  It is not something we can take for granted and must be consistently nurtured if it is to be retained.  We are proud that we now have a generation of children who have no concept of war, and who grew up outside of the Troubles, the checkpoints, the bombings and the horror.  We have worked hard for this and continue to work hard for peace.  We know what it is to work towards peace and to sustain it.  Peace is, to us, a process that must continue.  This is exactly what gives Ireland the legitimacy to play a leading role in helping to bring about peace, to end violence, to be diplomats and to use all of our experience as well our seat on the UN Security Council, to do so.<\/p>  <p>  How can we look to promote peace and stability without neutrality?  We are members of the UN and uphold our obligations under the UN Charter, including chapter 7, to use our experience to help to bring about peace and security throughout the world.  Our unique place on the UN Security Council furthers that legitimacy to remain militarily neutral to advance and maintain international peace and security.  To be very clear, military neutrality does not mean that we remain silent and passive.  Indeed, the Irish people are leading the way on this by donating generously to agencies that can help people on the ground such as the Irish Red Cross.  Thousands have offered sanctuary in their own homes to those displaced by war.  Irish UN peacekeepers have played a leading role in promoting peace and security for more than 60 years in many conflicts including in Lebanon, the Congo and Mali, to name but a few.<\/p>  <p>  In his opening comments the Minister referred to the need to have a mature and honest debate about our shared defence.  As he was speaking, I was thinking that if I was a young recruit in our naval base in Haulbowline, in McKee barracks or at the Curragh Camp, listening to a Government politician talk about \"mature\" debates while at the same time enforcing poverty on those who stand up and wish to engage in defence and peacekeeping missions, I would feel particularly hard done by.  Any conversation in relation to our \"shared defence\" and the role of defence should start by determining how we can improve the pay and conditions of those who already stand up in this country, build up our defence infrastructure, invest in our radar systems and get our ships back out to sea.<\/p>  <p>  We may be neutral but that does not mean we cannot act.  Currently the Constitution allows the Government to decide what exactly our neutrality means.  The saying goes that one should never waste a good crisis but we cannot allow this war to be used to push Ireland towards a more integrated EU common defence policy.  The EU, by its very nature, is a peace process.  It is a movement for peace and that is where its real success lies.<\/p>  <p>  We must stand against the use of Ireland's airports as corridors to transport US troops to the Middle East and elsewhere.  We must not be fooled into thinking that we have no choice but to join military alliances such as NATO.  What we should be focused on is peace and stability abroad and at home.  This war is sending shock waves across the world that will impact us all.  We have already experienced a sharp rise in fuel prices.  Fuel and food shortages are very possible, not only here but throughout the African continent, which increases the prospects of famine.  We need to lead the way in combating that.  Potentially, we will welcome up to 200,000 displaced people over the coming months.  Our population could increase by approximately 1% in the weeks ahead.  We have to play our part by being a place of sanctuary for those fleeing war and are doing so.  We are doing so while knowing that we have a housing, healthcare and childcare crisis, a lack of school places and limited access to mental health services to deal with the trauma that many of those fleeing war have experienced.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish by reiterating the point made by others that being neutral is not a passive position.  Being neutral allows us to play our own role in world affairs, to be peacekeepers and to stand for humanitarian endeavours.  If there is to be a debate about neutrality, it should be about how we can advance those policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000015#N00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1648635120,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank People Before Profit for bringing this very important Bill to the Chamber for debate this morning as it allows us discuss Ireland's military posture.  It is very topical and timely.<\/p>  <p>  In the limited time available to me I will focus on a niche area that has not been discussed yet this morning, namely, how dependent our Defence Forces are on training and cross-training with other militaries.  My big concern about the Bill relates to the wording therein.  It says that the State should not \"aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for war or other armed conflict\".  While I can totally understand the motives behind that, the issue on the ground is that the cross-training that is continuing at the moment with other militaries may not be able to continue as a result of this.  I will provide five examples to the House to illustrate my point.<\/p>  <p>  First, many Deputies and people at home may not be aware that in my own constituency six Maltese cadets are currently training at the Curragh Camp as part of a 15-month residential course.  They are actually being commissioned or graduated next Tuesday and my concern is that if this Bill proceeds such an exchange, which is preparing a foreign power for war or armed conflict, may not be able to proceed in future.  I ask representatives of People Before Profit to elaborate on whether that would be an issue for them.<\/p>  <p>  Another example relates to our bomb disposal people.  Again, in my own constituency of Kildare South, we have an ordnance school which is a recognised centre of excellence for bomb disposal training in the world.  Every year, numerous students and instructors come from other countries to cross-train with Irish students and instructors.  I am concerned that this programme would be prohibited under this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Third, from a hostage rescue point of view, our special forces cross-train with other militaries all across Europe and north America.  Would that still be allowed under this legislation?  If there was a hostage incident in Dublin Airport tonight or if a ferry was hijacked, would we be able to maintain the standards that the public quite rightly expects if that training channel was closed off?<\/p>  <p>  The fourth example relates to cybersecurity.  This country was attacked through cyberspace only last year.  We have people in Estonia at the moment at the NATO centre of excellence, one civilian and one military.  Would it be possible for that arrangement to continue under this Bill?<\/p>  <p>  Fifth, from a medical perspective, our troops have benefitted enormously from links with the armed forces in the United Kingdom, both in Northern Ireland and in Britain.<\/p> <p>There is a lot of training going on from the point of view of life support for battlefield defence trauma, and also for the control of catastrophic haemorrhage.  British troops come to Ireland to train, and Irish troops go to the UK to train.  It is very important from the point of view of the cross-pollination of ideas.<\/p> <p> My big concern with the Bill is that it might isolate Ireland militarily.  If any reassurance could be given that that is not the case, it would be greatly appreciated.  We have benefitted enormously from interacting and cross-training with other military forces.  My concern is that if those channels were closed off, the proficient standards the Defence Forces have achieved would start to degrade and deplete in a matter of months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000015#N00300","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648635720,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  Ireland has a long history of neutrality which goes back centuries, to the days of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Daniel O'Connell and James Connolly, who all advocated neutrality for Ireland as a way of protecting the common good and preventing militarism.  Historically, small countries have always been sceptical of the intentions of military blocs.  In general, historically, military blocs have orientated their military actions to their economic objectives.  We cannot escape that with any analysis of history.  For example, NATO's involvement in the Middle East is a perfect example of a large military bloc acting on behalf of large countries in large part because of their own economic objectives.  Small countries have very little influence on the decisions of large military blocs.  If the State aligns itself with a large military bloc, there is no doubt that our young men and women will be involved in their military actions, but we will have precious little influence over the decisions on those military actions.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the debate that is happening at the moment is informed by the shocking experience of Ukraine.  I am struck that there is a desire within Fine Gael at the moment not to waste a crisis.  There are two elements within Fine Gael policy in the past 30 to 40 years.  The first one is federalism.  There is an instinct within Fine Gael to push towards a more integrated EU at all stages.  We see that at the moment with regard to Fine Gael outsourcing our foreign policy to the EU in many ways.  Ireland is afraid to make decisions, for example, on the Russian ambassador, because it says it is waiting for the rest of the EU.  The Government says it is not making those decisions because collective decisions are stronger decisions, but there has been no collective decision to remove the Russian ambassadors from European Union member states.  I welcome the expulsion of four staff of the Russian embassy yesterday, but it is not enough.  The Government must go further than that.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a militaristic instinct within Fine Gael.  We saw many of the party's Deputies come out in favour of NATO involvement and also in favour of increased militarism in this State.  It is in sharp contrast to the fact that we have Naval Service patrol ships tied up right now in our ports.  The EU is investigating Ireland's inability to patrol its own waters.  We had to rely on an EU patrol boat for the first time to patrol our waters.  Cybersecurity is brought up on a regular basis.  If we were serious about this, we would invest in our own defences.  Two years ago, the National Cyber Security Centre had a budget of &euro;5 million.  The PR spend for the Department of the Taoiseach in the same year was &euro;15 million.  One Department spent three times the amount of money on PR than the country spent on its National Cyber Security Centre, which as a result, has cost us approximately &euro;100 million.<\/p>  <p>  There is a necessity for Ireland to be active.  We need active neutrality.  We have a competency built up from years of peacekeeping, anticolonialism and working against nuclear proliferation and from the fact that missionaries have left this country to help the developing world to develop.  As a result, the Irish passport opens doors and minds across the world.  We should be using our neutrality, in an active sense, to put pressure on Russia to de-escalate.  People might say we would have no influence in that regard, yet how come the Israeli Prime Minister can ring up Vladimir Putin and make an effort at de-escalation?  How come President Macron can do that?  Why have we outsourced so much of our foreign affairs actions to the European Union?  We are reducing our own sovereignty in the name of protecting Ukraine's sovereignty and that does not make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000016#O00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1648635720,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I too support this Bill, but there are pitfalls in it.

I read with interest in the poll carried out by <i>Irish Independent<\/i>on whether Ireland should remain military neutral in relation to the war that there was majority 2:1 support for continuing our current policy.  However, this support was weakest among Government parties with just 53% of Government supporters supporting the continuation of Ireland being neutral.  My reading of this shows a weakening of Ireland&rsquo;s stance on neutrality.  While I would like our neutrality to continue, I would not support Shannon Airport being refused its use for a base for US soldiers going to other countries.  Common sense must apply.  While neutrality is important, we must have spending in the Department of Defence to protect our country from sea and air traffic from other countries.  It is scandalous that this country does not have proper capability to protect itself from issues that are not out of our control.

My view is that our neutrality is sacrosanct.  It is extremely important.

In case there is any doubt as to why we need it, that was set out clearly almost 20 years ago in the High Court when the very courageous Ed Horgan took a case seeking to highlight what was going on in our country regarding Iraq and Shannon.  The judge clearly stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDespite the great historic value attached by Ireland to the concept of neutrality, that status was nowhere reflected in ... [the Constitution], or anywhere else in ... legislation.  It is effectively a matter of ... policy ... albeit a policy to which, traditionally at least, considerable importance was attached ... [but a policy that could change at any time].  <\/blockquote>  <p>We see that happening all the time.  <\/p><p>It is very disappointing that the Minister used his long speech to say he cannot agree with this Bill when every opinion poll has shown us the people want to keep our neutrality but to use it in a most positive and active way.  It was one of the main reasons we gained respect and got a seat on the Security Council.  The Minister has left, and I respect he is always here for as long as he can be, but he chose to quote selectively from Desmond Tutu, the Nobel peace prize winner who died in December last year.  He quoted him but did not include it in his speech.  He said: &quot;If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.&quot;  I certainly agree with Desmond Tutu but I do not agree with the Minister using that to back up an argument against neutrality.  It is a selective quotation.  It was taken out of context.  I and any of my colleagues here are totally against injustice, recognising that it is wrong and it leads to wars in any event.  None of us are neutral when it comes to injustice.  None of us are neutral when it comes to the illegal war by Russia on Ukraine.  That is not what neutrality is about.  If we are to quote Desmond Tutu, let us quote him in context, the man who was fearless in criticising all power, no matter where it was or the colour of it.  He said he had been involved in the peace business.  We talk about peace-making now, which is more war-making, but he had been involved all his life in the peace business.  He said he had learned a lot about the business of war and I will come back to that.  Interestingly, he also said: &quot;Children are a wonderful gift.  They have an extraordinary capacity to see into the heart of things and to expose sham and humbug for what they are.&quot;  That is exactly what he did.  He spoke out clearly against nuclear weapons, the Iraq War, the siege of Gaza, the bloated military budgets and so on.

Nobody in this Chamber or in the Seanad will openly argue that we should abandon our traditional neutrality and join NATO because they do not have to.  Structures for an EU military alliance have been carefully and steadily put in place.  An EU army separate from and able to act independently of NATO but closely linked to it is the objective, and our Defence Forces are already part of this project.  We already have 850 military personnel in the EU rapid reaction force.  We have signed up to permanent structured co-operation, PESCO.  PESCO was established on the basis of Article 42.7 of the Lisbon treaty.  People will remember that the treaty was rejected in a referendum.  An important fact of that rejection was due to fears it would lead to an EU army.  After being given an opt-out from Article 42.7, the treaty was passed in a second vote.  Despite the opt-out, Governments have opted into PESCO and the common European defence policy.  Now the latest development is the strategic compass, which calls for increased military spending and research, building the rapid deployment capacity to 5,000 strong brigades and giving the EU strategic military autonomy while co-operating with NATO.<\/p>  <p>  The involvement in these military alliances, which is what they are, gives rise to serious ambiguity as to what our neutrality actually means now.

Our neutrality is more important than ever following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which, I fear, may threaten our country&rsquo;s vital role in being militarily neutral on an international level.<\/p>  <p>  Irish neutrality is under attack by many of the Members in this Chamber and I completely oppose the way many Deputies have come out in support of militarisation.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that neutrality is defended and nurtured.  We are a small, neutral nation.  Our strengths have always been in peacekeeping and speaking out against injustice, not in military might.  This is something to be incredibly proud of.  Neutrality gives us a standing.  It gives us an important voice that other countries will listen to.<\/p>  <p>  Our focus should be on looking after people at risk, taking in refugees, and ensuring they have safe travel and a secure place to go.  We would bring far more to a crisis in focusing and providing this type of assistance than we could in any military assistance.  The focus should always be assisting those affected and this focus is taken away when military gain becomes the main priority, which would be the case if we were to join NATO or any type of EU military intervention.<\/p>  <p>  By maintaining our neutrality, it does not mean we condone the terrible conflicts occurring around the world.  To be militarily and politically neutral are two very different things.  We will always stand up for what is right and do all in our power to sanction the perpetrators and assist the victims.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a concerted move to undermine our neutrality over the past number of years.  The most glaring example of that, which I glad is mentioned in this Bill, is the use of Shannon by probably one of the biggest criminals in the world, the American army, in destroying Iraq and much of the Middle East.  What is the difference between that and what the Russians are doing in Ukraine now?  That is what I would like to know.  I would like the Government to explain what the difference is because that is what we have to defend against.  Whether it is America, Russia or any other country, or whether it is the EU, we have to stand against this as well because it is wrong no matter where it is and no matter who does it.  That is what we have to stand up against at all times.<\/p>  <p>  We need to stress the importance of our focus.

We have been reminded here today of the importance of the Constitution as the expression of our values.  The preamble of Bunreacht na h-&Eacute;ireann speaks of \"due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity\" and of Ireland striving so that \"concord\" can be \"established with other nations\".  We have differences of opinion - some of these were expressed here today - but I believe we are all in agreement with those fundamental principles.<\/p>  <p>  Prudence is a quality which is rightly valued in matters of state.  It argues against hasty or intemperate action.  It also argues against needlessly limiting the options upon which we may rely in the future.  Not all things can be foreseen.  Just six weeks ago, we would not have believed that we would be in the middle of a new war in Europe or that 3.8 million Ukrainians would have fled for their lives from their homes.<\/p>  <p>  When we negotiated the European Peace Facility, EPF, just over a year ago, we ensured that, in line with the programme for Government, it included the option for constructive abstention in the case of a decision by member states to provide lethal equipment to a partner organisation or country.  In negotiating prudently, we did not shut off the possibility of Ireland providing any support at all.  Before the EPF had reached its first anniversary, Ireland did, in fact, exercise constructive abstention from lethal military support to Ukraine, but instead provided financing for protective and non-lethal equipment.<\/p>  <p>  We must retain flexibility to react to world events and that is one reason it would not be prudent to change the Constitution in the ways proposed in this Bill.  Nor do I believe that it would be just to do so in advance of a full national discussion.<\/p>  <p>  Justice is a value which is expressed not only through national legislation but also through international law.  Since 1945, there has been a legal prohibition on the use of force other than in self-defence or when authorised by the UN Security Council as part of a collective security mechanism.  The Bill before us today would limit us to the first, by excluding the second.<\/p>  <p>  Our foreign policy champions the rules-based international order and the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  That is precisely why we worked so hard to gain our current seat on the Council.  The UN Charter makes clear that, where the Security Council has mandated action to restore international peace and security, all states are required to assist it.  Impeding our ability to do so in any way runs contrary to the core values underpinning our foreign and security policy.<\/p>  <p>  Charity, as a concept, is not normally thought of as relevant to security but in a broad sense it encompasses empathy and support.  It describes a country which engages proactively with the world.  Ireland has been generous in sharing its expertise, including in the provision of peacekeeping training.  For example, we contribute a Defence Forces trainer to the UN Regional Service Centre in Entebbe, Uganda, providing counter-improvised explosive device, IED, training to mainly African peacekeepers.  Improvised explosive ordnance is one of the most lethal risks for UN peacekeepers.  Two personnel from Egypt were unfortunately killed by an IED in Mali only this month.  Could this training also be helpful in armed conflict and, therefore, prohibited under this Bill?  I see that as a real possibility, and as a good example of the unintended consequences of a Bill such as this.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the point that our EU membership is entirely consistent with our existing policy of neutrality.  The Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, which is an integral part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, provides the Union with an operational capacity to undertake missions outside the EU for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.  In line with these objectives, last week saw EU leaders agree the Strategic Compass &ndash; an important strategy document that will guide the EU's CSDP for the decade ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Compass is not a common European defence policy.  Rather, it enables the EU to better anticipate threats, respond to crises and deepen our co-operation with partners.  In particular, it sets out a series of concrete actions in areas such as crisis management, resilience, capability development and the EU's partnerships with key international actors, including the United Nations.  There is also a strong focus on work to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s ability to respond to new and emerging challenges such as cyberattacks or hybrid threats.<\/p>  <p>  The EU treaty makes clear that there will be no common defence without the unanimous agreement of the European Council.  Moreover, Ireland's participation in a common defence is already prohibited under Article 29.4.9&deg; of the Constitution.  This is reinforced by the Irish protocol to the Lisbon treaty.  Any change in that position could take place only with the approval of the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  I note also that there is simply no discussion at present among EU member states of the idea of a common defence.  Throughout the two years we have spent discussing the Strategic Compass, states have focused on improved crisis management capacity, on capability development, on doing more to counter cyber and hybrid threats, on doing more to support our partners outside the EU to provide for their own security, on developing closer partnerships with other international and regional organisations, on improving interoperability &ndash; on everything, in fact, bar turning the EU into a military organisation with a common defence.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is not a member of NATO but participates in the Partnership for Peace to ensure that our Defence Forces can co-operate more effectively with contingents from partner countries in increasingly challenging UN-operated or UN-mandated missions led by the EU and NATO.  In Lebanon, for example, which I visited and where I represented the Government on St. Patrick's Day, this has allowed the Defence Forces to operate side by side with their Polish counterparts in a joint Irish-Polish battalion in the UNIFIL mission, which also involves troops from Malta and Hungary.<\/p>  <p>  I have already referred to the European Peace Facility where, in a context we could never have predicted, Ireland is paying for medical supplies, protective equipment and rations for Ukrainian soldiers, who are defending their country from illegal aggression by a larger neighbour.  To accept the contents of this Bill would be to prevent the Government or any future Government from providing similar support - in other words, to ignore an urgent request from a partner, which is defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, fully in line with international law and with Article 51 of the UN Charter, or to, by our inaction, draw a false equivalence between an aggressor and a victim &ndash; between the violator of the UN Charter and the violated &ndash; and then to pat ourselves on the back and to call this neutrality.  Is that what this House wants?  These are merely some examples of the ways in which the provisions of this Bill potentially constrain the exercise of the authority of the Executive in respect of the conduct of external relations, as outlined in Article 29 of the Constitution.<\/p> <p> I thank the Acting Chair for the opportunity to take part in this important debate.  There is a strong argument for continued discussion and reflection on Ireland's security and defence policy and on our long-standing policy of military neutrality.  However, these conversations must happen at the appropriate time and in an open and informed manner.  I do not believe this House wishes to limit Ireland's ongoing work to contribute to international peace and security.  However, this is what enacting this Bill would amount to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000018#Q00300","speaker":"1586","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648637520,"counter":93,"content":"<p>We can have a referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000019#R00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1648637520,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The concept of neutrality in this country is under threat like never before.

It is against militarism and joining any military pact by stealth, since those promote conflict, regardless of where they are.  Ireland's reputation across the world is second to none with regard to social justice, peacekeeping and standing up for the oppressed across the world.

The position on this Bill is dishonest.  This Bill is to create a conversation and debate for the entire country about the position on neutrality.  We need to do that when there is a greater threat of war globally than there has been for many decades, between powers that have nuclear weapons.  The Bill proposes to maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances and not allowing our territory to be used to prosecute war or to transport personnel or war material for the purposes of war.  It prevents us from adopting a decision by the European Council to participate in a war.  We can only participate in a war, with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, if we are attacked ourselves.  That is what the Bill proposes.<\/p>  <p>  I believe it is in line with the wishes of the vast majority of people.  It is certainly in line with the traditions of James Connolly, who helped to found this State, and of Wolfe Tone.  It is in line with the tradition that established this State, in opposition to the slaughter of the First World War and the colonial domination of the British Empire.  That is what it proposes to do.  In answer to Deputy Berry's question, we do not believe in any way that it inhibits our proud tradition of peacekeeping or humanitarian assistance for the oppressed or people suffering around the world.  Any concerns about that could be addressed by changing wording on Committee Stage.  We are open to amendments on the wording, but the key principles of this are copper-fastening our military neutrality and not being involved in military alliances.<\/p>  <p>  The dishonesty of this Government is that while it has to pay lip-service to neutrality, in reality it has eroded, breached and undermined our military neutrality as have successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments .  They are now seeking to use the terrible crisis and Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine to do something they have long tried to do, which is to move closer to EU militarisation and to the NATO military alliance.  That is the truth.  By doing that, they are betraying that proud tradition of opposition to imperialism.<\/p>  <p>  Putin's war in Ukraine is disgusting, imperialist and bloody.  He should get out of Ukraine.  We have been consistent in opposing Russia's imperialist adventures in a way that our Government and the European Union have not.  We opposed Russia's involvement in Afghanistan and in Chechnya, with the bloody levelling of Grozny.  Only a few months ago, we opposed the Collective Security Treaty Organization, CSTO, which is Russia's version of NATO, intervening against workers in Kazakhstan.  We opposed Russia in Georgia, Syria and everywhere it has gone, because Putin is an imperialist and a warmonger, and Russia has a long history of imperialism.  We are consistent, as was James Connolly, with the tradition of neutrality, in opposing all warmongers and imperialists.  The Government is silent on that.<\/p>  <p>  If CSTO and Russia are imperialists, so are the powers that dominate NATO, which the Government is silent about.  In the NATO war on Afghanistan, tens of thousands of people were slaughtered and blown up with drone missiles at weddings, in buses and so on by NATO forces.  The US and UK led a war in Iraq, which directly killed 500,000 people, as Deputy Gino Kenny just said.  It indirectly resulted in the deaths of more than 1 million people.  It completely destroyed the infrastructure of Iraq and destabilised the entire Middle East.  The disaster that we have seen in Syria would not have happened if not for the US and UK-led war in Iraq.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, Amnesty International and UN Human Rights Watch confirmed something that Palestinians have been saying for decades, that we have said to the Government and European Union for years, that Israel is an apartheid state involved in ethnic cleansing and committing crimes against humanity.  No sanctions were imposed on it by the European Union or NATO.  It is quite the contrary.  The powers that dominate NATO arm Israel to the teeth, even though it is guilty of committing war crimes on an ongoing basis, for 70 years, against the Palestinian people.<\/p>  <p>  The war in Yemen is conducted by Saudi Arabia.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, sends people from Ireland every year to develop trade relations with the most despotic dictatorship in the world, in Saudi Arabia, that has been at war for seven years in Yemen, killing 377,000 people, including 10,000 children, and has brought 14 million people to the brink of starvation according to the UN.  It is armed by the US, the UK and France.  They are directly involved in that war.<\/p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Are there any sanctions against them?  None.  Why?  Because it is in US interests to support the Saudi dictatorship as part of its project of controlling and dominating that area for the purposes of oil.  I could go down through the list.  The Government is silent on those things.  That is what neutrality means.  It means not being silent.  It is not about being indifferent; it means being consistent in opposing oppression, imperialism and war-mongering rather than being selective in the way the Government is.  The Government is against some wars but for other wars if its allies are involved in them and arming people to conduct those wars.  This is now more vital than ever, as two nuclear powers engage in a stand-off.  Why would we be involved in any alliance with powers that have nuclear weapons that could destroy the world?  Now more than ever, we need to protect neutrality and have a constitutional referendum in order to secure that neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000019#R00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648638120,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an cheist.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648638120,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648638120,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Insofar as a vote has been called, it is deferred until the weekly voting time this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000020#S00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1648638120,"counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000020#S00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1648638120,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Ar an Aoine, chonaiceamar an m&eacute;ad&uacute; is m&oacute; ar easpa d&iacute;dine &oacute; thosaigh Covid.

On Friday, we learned that last month saw the single biggest increase in homelessness since Covid began and that there are now almost 10,000 people living in emergency funded accommodation.  We have come full circle on this, with the failure of this Government matching that of the previous one.  On Monday, three separate reports were published, all showing another massive increase in house prices.  In parts of rural Ireland, these increases are more than 20%.  The average price of a home across the State now is close to &euro;300,000 and in Dublin it is far more than that.  This means that a person needs earnings of between &euro;77,000 and upwards of &euro;100,000 in most of the State to afford a home.  That is so far above the earnings of the vast majority of workers as to make home ownership completely and utterly impossible.  This locks out a whole generation of home ownership.  Of course, the Taoiseach knows that because this morning we saw accounts of a confidential Cabinet memo that states one of the reasons the new auto-enrolment pension scheme is needed is to help pay rent for the increasing number of older people who will now not own a home when they retire and will remain trapped paying extortionate rent.  All of this confirms once again that the Government is waving the white flag and telling a whole generation of people they will never own their own home.  Young couples starting out in their careers are locked out of home ownership.  Single persons, even those on a good income, are locked out home ownership.  People in their 30s, 40s or 50s are locked out of home ownership.<\/p>  <p>  Why is this happening?  Covid-19 construction site closures had an impact and Brexit supply chain disruptions are a factor, but these are not the main reasons.  For far too long, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have over-relied on private investors and developers to meet housing need.  God knows, they have dished out tax reliefs, grants and subsidies like confetti.  All that has done, however, is push house prices up even more.  Never was so much spent to achieve so very little.  On top of this, we are now quite rightly supporting families fleeing war in Ukraine and we have an obligation to put a safe roof over their heads at this awful time for their country.  We are now dealing with crisis upon crisis.  We are dealing with a massive housing emergency and the scale of the Government response needs to match that reality.  What is the Taoiseach going to do?  It is unconscionable to blindly continue with policies that are so clearly failing.  The evidence of that failure is clear to be seen every single day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000020#S00500","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1648638120,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I have repeatedly said in this House and since I became Taoiseach that housing remains the most serious social issue and crisis facing our country.

The Government has a plan to auto-enrol them in a pension so that they can raid the pension fund to continue to pay rack rents when they reach their mid-60s.  According to the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, a confidential Cabinet memo stated that the new auto-enrolment pension scheme is &quot;particularly important&quot; because &quot;an increasing number of older people will need sufficient income to meet rental costs during their retirement years&quot;.  I do not know what planet the Government is on, but if anyone thinks the answer to the housing crisis of 2022 is modest pensions that will accrue to people in 20, 30 or 40 years from now, is it any wonder we are in the mess that were in?<\/p><p>Renters reading the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>today will have been tearing their hair out.  Hundreds of thousands of them do not have pensions because they cannot afford one while paying exorbitant rents of around &euro;2,000 a month and struggling with a very acute cost-of-living crisis.  The declining rates of home ownership are a great concern.  The rate has fallen from 79% in 1991 to 68% in 2016 and will certainly be revealed to have fallen further when the new census is taken and we see the results.  It is also the case that the average age on which someone buys their first home has increased from 27 in 2006 to 35 now.  If people are taking eight additional years to buy their home, they are spending up to an additional &euro;192,000 in rent.  Meanwhile, when they do eventually buy, Ireland has the highest mortgage rates in the EU while the average house price is &euro;300,000 nationally and more than &euro;400,000 in Dublin.  All of this additional money that is sunk into housing costs means there is nothing left over for anything else.  Keeping a roof over your head is in the here and now and trumps any concerns about a pension arrangement.<\/p><p>While I welcome that the Government has plans to address the pension time bomb, we have a housing time bomb that exploded years ago.  The two are linked because living mortgage-free in retirement is a completely different proposition than paying market rents, even on a good pension.  We have a housing crisis that can only be solved if affordability is seriously tackled.  There are no signs from the Government that it is doing this.

Surely everyone in this House agrees we should as a State and society deal with poor pension provision for workers in this country, both those who own homes and those who do not own homes.  The auto-enrolment scheme does not discriminate when it comes to home ownership and pension provision is not good enough where we are today as a society.  I disagree with the Deputy in her reference to short-termism.  This has always been the problem where pensions have always been put on the long term and decisions and have been deflected because of a lack of the sense that we had to deal with the here and now.  It is essential for workers and for a proper society into the future that we develop a pension system that is complementary and supplementary to the State pension system.  I am delighted that the Government has taken a very decisive step to get on with auto-enrolment in the decision we took yesterday.  That is the type of reform and decision-making this Government is about in implementing the programme for Government we have laid out.  We will not be deflected from that.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme is irrespective and does not differentiate between whether a person owns a home or does not.  The most significant issue for us for auto-enrolment is the dearth of cover for so many people.  Our supplementary pension cover has remained static over the past 20 years, hovering around 50% of the total working age population.  This rate reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  There can be no argument against doing the right thing and it will have challenges for all concerned but it is the right thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  On housing and rent, I have said and acknowledge the crisis that housing presents to us today.  We have produced the Housing for All strategy some months ago before the end of last year.  It is a clear strategy that has financial resources behind it, and it will take a number of years to get to the critical mass of housing that we want built throughout the country, but supply is the key to this.  I have no doubt about that.  We cannot go on with 20,000 houses a year.  We certainly need 33,000 to 35,000 and perhaps more houses per annum and they have to be of a mixed type.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned the 31,000 homes that have commenced construction in 2021.  That is the highest since 2008.  That is important and is a 42% increase year on year, but that is based on the previous year which, of course, was affected by Covid-19.  Some 1,580 cost rental homes is the target to be delivered this year and I believe cost rental is something that can be accelerated to give real options to people.  The new national first home affordable purchase shared equity scheme will also assist in the purchase of homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000021#T02100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1648638720,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Auto-enrolment, of course, is something that is to be welcomed and, in fact, I said in my contribution which the Taoiseach must have missed.<\/p> <p>However, it was also reported in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>that a confidential Cabinet memorandum stated that the new auto-enrolment pension scheme is particularly important because an increasing number of older people will need sufficient income to meet rental costs during their retirement years.

Currently, there is a generation of people who are struggling just to keep their heads above water because of the cost of housing, particularly rental housing.  They are the same people who will be asked to pay the auto-enrolment and who, when it comes to their pension, will then pay to keep a roof over their heads because they have not been able to purchase.  The two things are linked.<br\/><br\/>Yes, we need more delivery and supply, but it must be affordable.  History has a habit of repeating itself if we do not learn lessons from it.

As the Taoiseach will be aware, this is an area that has effectively been in a deep crisis since the national disability strategy was launched in 2004.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, who I commend on her compassion and her strong commitment to improving this service, has accepted that further progress on addressing the deficit in services is needed.  The situation has not been helped in the last few years with the transfer of functions in this area from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in addition to the chaos that Covid-19 brought about with the closure of residential day care services.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lack of cohesion and an inability to pin down precisely where the responsibility for respite care actually lies.  This is compounded by the issue of transport services for adults and children with a disability.  A family is allocated a respite place only to find out that there is no transport, or they have transport and then find out that there is no respite bed.  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, recently announced funding for the upgrading and improvement of the transport options for HSE-funded disability organisations and that is welcome.  However, what good is that if there are no residential or respite services for people to be transported to?<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, issued a statement on the impact of the war in Ukraine on persons with disabilities, saying: \"Ireland will not leave people with disabilities behind as we respond to the crisis\".  Leaving no disabled person behind is exactly the type of ambition we need.  That said, there are many families who will have heard or read that statement and questioned, not the will, but the capacity of the State to deliver on that promise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000022#U01300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1648639320,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000022#U01400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1648639320,"counter":142,"content":"<p>They will have looked at their own children or their young adults who are falling between the cracks in terms of child and adult disability services.

How can we talk of leaving no disabled person behind when it is clear that we already have a system that is manifestly unable to provide even the most minimal levels of respite care for thousands of adults and children languishing on respite care and disability lists?  What assessments are taking place of the further strain that will be placed on our already creaking and highly dysfunctional respite services?<\/p>  <p>  I emphasise this is not about refusing help.  It is about asking difficult and important questions because, at present, it is abundantly clear that we simply do not have the capacity to meet the existing respite care needs.  Does the Taoiseach agree that our rhetoric should be shaped by our capacity to deliver on those promises that we are making to disabled persons, irrespective of where they come from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000022#U01500","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1648639320,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy raising this issue.  She referred to the transfer of disability policy and functions from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That was a deliberate decision.  In fact, before the last general election there was much commentary on disability services and there was a view that for the medium term it would be better if there was a more singular focus on disability by a new Department.  The view was that within the enormity of the Department of Health and all the issues in that Department disability was not getting the type of focus that it should under that statutory framework and delivery system.  That was the motivation behind it and it is one I support.  There have been challenges, as there always are, when it comes to transferring services from one Department to another, particularly in the delivery mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there has been additional funding.  New funding of approximately &euro;65 million has been allocated to disability services in the budget for 2022.  Of that, approximately &euro;9 million is for respite care services.  That said, I am not satisfied with where we are in respect of disability services, and I want to be candid about that, and particularly with regard to respite and the provision of therapies to children.  For a number of years the HSE has developed a progressing disability services programme and approach, and the Government has allocated additional funding to the HSE in respect of therapists.  I am still not satisfied that the translation, as it were, of that resource to parents on the ground is happening to the degree that it should.  In an earlier era, I was involved in developing new schools for occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy in the colleges outside Dublin, so we have a regional spread in terms of providing more graduates.  However, it is not translating to the degree that it should in terms of services for children.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge what the Deputy said about the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and others.  I also acknowledge we have more work to do in that regard, particularly on the provision of therapies and respite services.  There has been ongoing progress with after-school services, community initiatives, personal assistant hours, school-leavers day services and so forth.  Again, we believe that shift from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is the right decision, ultimately, in terms of having a focused delivery mechanism.  Capacities have to be built up, as well as proper integration between those delivering services on the ground with the parent Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000022#U01600","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1648639320,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response, but even with the transfer of functions to another Department the issue of respite care in disability services is not getting enough focus.<\/p> <p>It is still severely lacking.  This comes back to my core question.  How will we cope with the pressures?  How will respite services in this country cope with additional pressures?  We need to answer this question honestly because many families are concerned.  Every week in my offices I meet families who are struggling.  They are begging for help.  They are begging for respite for adult children.  They are unable to cope and they have health conditions themselves.  Will we assure these people there will be no erosion of current services, weak and all as they are, with the extra pressures coming into the system?  We need to have this honest debate now.  We need to provide assurances to these many families throughout the State who are struggling.  They are pleading for more help and for basic respite services.  We owe it to these families to be very clear that their services will not be eroded in any way and that more services will be put into the system to help these families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000022#U01700","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648639920,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I do not want to juxtapose in the mainstream the ongoing national provision of services for disabilities with the war in Ukraine.

I do not think we can resile from that.  We are doing analysis of the refugees coming into the country so it can inform the type of responses we need to make.  Apart from accommodation we will need responses in education, early childcare and health.  It is very serious.  For example, yesterday I was informed that approximately 6,000 unaccompanied minors from Ukraine have entered the European Union.  We will have a share of them.

By its nature a turlough has channels underneath where the water goes out.  Unfortunately in recent years it has not been functioning as normal.  It was designated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Unfortunately, some of the families in the area had to leave because the water level has kept rising.  A solution had been found by Roscommon County Council in partnership with the Office of Public Works, OPW, under emergency powers.  There are 1949 emergency powers to allow local authorities to act where people's lives or properties are in danger.  The council in Roscommon used these powers.  Unfortunately, Friends of the Irish Environment, FIE, which is funded by the Government, decided to take a case against it and stop the works.  The High Court judgment came last week.  The judge very clearly stated the 1949 emergency powers are redundant.<\/p>  <p>  There has been no comment from the Taoiseach or the Government over the past week.  The Taoiseach might not be worried about ten families in County Roscommon but I am because they are my constituents.  He might worry about flooding out the road in Portrane or in his constituency in Cork.  I know about jobs throughout the country, in Doonbeg in Clare, in Galway and in several other parts of the country, where houses are at risk or will fall into the sea, and because these emergency powers have been struck down in the courts - I would question why - these people have been left redundant, so to speak.  Because of these powers being struck down, a county manager has no emergency power and the OPW has been left redundant.<\/p>  <p>  In Roscommon, money was spent on a pipe as the sensible option to take the overflow from the lake.  What is very worrying is that it has come to my attention, and unfortunately the council did not even tell me but I found out in Dublin, that over the past six to eight months someone in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications got onto the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  Be that a Minister or a Secretary General, the person got on to the Chief State Solicitor's and the Attorney General.  From what I understand, the State joined the FIE against the council.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications or the Chief State Solicitor's Office was going to join with an unelected group against the council in a case in County Roscommon.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach aware that in the wake of this judgment, water on the road cannot be let into a ditch unless screening is done?  Will the Taoiseach find out whether it was Minister or who it was who made the call to the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Attorney General to get involved in this?

We had called for a proper effective sick pay scheme in September 2020 on foot of appeals from representatives of those working in meat plants and because we saw that employees in the childcare and early years sector were unable to access sick pay in the context of the Covid pandemic.  Our concern now is that the Government's proposal does not represent a right to access sick pay from the start of employment.  In particular, seasonal workers and early years educators, such as those working in the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, who are employed for part of the year will not be covered because the scheme envisages a 13-week period before people are entitled to access.

Where the required medical evidence is submitted with an application and the eligibility rules are met, 92% of applications were processed within a week in February.  However, on the Deputy&rsquo;s point, applications that require an officer to review to ensure eligibility for payment, or where the person is already in receipt of another social welfare payment, can take longer to process.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection are working to clear all claims as quickly as possible, with additional resources being allocated to this work as a priority, the employment of temporary staff and system changes to increase automation within the process.  There is an issue but work is being undertaken to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000026#Y00800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1648641720,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Last night, Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a motion that aims to protect children with disabilities.

Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine is illegal, barbaric and immoral.  Russia must halt its military action and withdraw from Ukraine immediately and unconditionally.  With our partners in the international community, we are resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine.  <\/p>  <p>  I spoke with President Zelenskiy by phone on 16 March during my visit to the United States.  I found him to be calm, focused and determined.  I assured him of Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine.  He expressed his gratitude to the Government and people of Ireland for their support, including in welcoming those fleeing the war; for our support for Ukraine&rsquo;s application for EU membership; and for our support for the severest sanctions against Russia.  I welcome that President Zelenskiy has accepted the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s invitation to address this House next month.<\/p>  <p>  I attended a meeting of the European Council in Brussels last Thursday and Friday, where EU leaders again discussed Russia&rsquo;s aggression against Ukraine.  We heard directly by video call from President Zelenskiy and he set out the desperate circumstances facing Ukraine one month to the day since the brutal invasion began.  He called for the EU to continue to exercise the maximum pressure on Russia to end its appalling war.  We were also joined in person by President Biden for an exchange of views on how the EU and the US can work collectively and in closer step to bring this war to a just end.<\/p>  <p>  This was the third meeting of EU leaders within a month since the beginning of Russia&rsquo;s illegal war on Ukraine.  We met in a special session of the European Council on 24 February, and at an informal meeting in Versailles on 10 and 11 March.  Determination and unity of purpose has characterised the EU&rsquo;s approach and that will remain essential in responding to Russia and the crisis it has caused.  Ireland has been to the forefront in the EU in calling for the most robust response to Russia&rsquo;s appalling violence in Ukraine, including additional sanctions.  We have fully supported the sanctions packages agreed to date and we are actively engaged with partners in looking at what further measures can be taken.  Ireland has contributed in full to the &euro;1 billion military assistance package provided by the European Peace Facility, EPF, for Ukraine; Ireland's total share will be &euro;22 million, which will go towards non-lethal elements, consistent with our involvement in the EPF.<\/p>  <p>  Among other supports, the Government has allocated &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid, as well as providing medical supplies to Ukraine.  We have launched a new dedicated Ukraine civil society fund of &euro;2 million specifically to support Irish NGOs responding to the crisis.  In recent weeks, more than 3.5 million people, mainly women and children, have arrived in the European Union.  The EU has reacted swiftly in response to this humanitarian catastrophe.  Member states, including Ireland, unanimously activated the temporary protection directive to offer immediate and effective assistance, and clear legal status to those fleeing Ukraine.  The European Commission has mobilised financial support through the EU budget, building on the wide range of assistance already available under the civil protection mechanism, the cohesion policy and the home affairs funds.<\/p>  <p>  As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland has co-ordinated efforts to try to end this conflict through diplomatic means, to hold Russia to account and to call out Russia&rsquo;s cynical attempts to use the Security Council and other UN bodies to spread disinformation about supposed Ukrainian bioweapons programmes.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is putting pressure on global food and nutrition security, and the worst impacts will be felt by the poorest countries, as well as those who rely on imports for their food security.<\/p> <p>Addressing global food and nutrition security is a long-standing priority for Ireland.  The European Union is now prioritising work on global food security, in particular by supporting food security and agriculture in Ukraine and food-deficit third countries.<\/p> <p> The war and the implementation by the EU and Ireland of far-reaching sanctions against Russia is having, and will continue to have, an impact across all economies, including Ireland's.  Global economic growth and investment will be impacted and this too will affect Ireland.  Ireland is playing its part in this humanitarian crisis and the cost of providing for the reception of refugees arriving from Ukraine will be very significant.  It is, however, a cost we must bear.<\/p> <p> The invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated the inflationary pressures the global economy was already experiencing as a result of supply chain disruptions brought about by Covid-19.  Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of energy, food, fertiliser and other commodities, and whereas Ireland's direct trade links with Russia and Ukraine are very limited, the economy is exposed to the indirect effects arising from the impact on our main trading partners and rising costs for energy and other commodities.  These international factors are outside Ireland&rsquo;s control but the Government will closely monitor developments and seek to assist where possible.  We will also continue to work closely with our European Union colleagues on how to respond.<\/p> <p> Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked further energy price increases and brought unprecedented volatility to energy markets.  This is feeding through to retail price increases for all consumers.  The impact on low-income households is, of course, a particular concern for the Government.  That is why we have taken targeted action to help alleviate the immediate pressure of energy costs.  The electricity credit of &euro;200 will soon be paid to all consumer accounts at an overall cost of &euro;400 million.  There is also a lump sum payment of &euro;125 for people on the fuel allowance, which benefits 372,000 households across the country.  This is in addition to the &euro;5 increase to the weekly fuel allowance that was announced in last October&rsquo;s budget.  In addition, we have temporarily reduced excise duty on fuel by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent per litre of marked gas oil.  The cost of these reductions is &euro;320 million overall.  For hauliers, a temporary grant scheme will provide a payment of &euro;100 per week to help mitigate the rising price of fuel and the scheme will operate for a period of eight weeks, valued at &euro;18 million.<\/p> <p> The Government will keep the energy situation under close and active review and we will continue to examine what measures are possible to manage the impact of rising energy prices for households and businesses.  While the Government is responding, and will continue to respond to this crisis, we have to be realistic that it will not be possible to respond to every unfavourable price move on global markets.  History teaches us that chasing inflationary pressures with ever more Government spending would be counterproductive.  The country&rsquo;s economy was recovering strongly as we were getting over the worst of the Covid-19 crisis with strong growth and reducing unemployment.  Our response to the crisis in Ukraine will affect economic growth and we need to be prudent in how we respond to the challenges that lie ahead.<\/p> <p> The agriculture sector has been particularly affected by inflation in the price of almost all farm input prices.  The Government is committed to supporting our farm families through the challenges that have arisen as a result of the war in Ukraine.  We are already providing support through the recently announced package of targeted interventions worth more than &euro;12 million to support additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards.  This is in addition to an &euro;8 million support scheme put in place recently for the pork sector.  Additional work is ongoing to develop contingency plans and technical advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises through what will be a difficult period and to prepare an industry response to the emerging issues with feed, fodder, fertiliser and other farm inputs.<\/p> <p> As the House is aware, millions of people have fled the horror in Ukraine to seek refuge in the European Union and other neighbouring states, and it is anticipated many more will follow.  The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response.  The scale of response to this crisis has been unprecedented and Irish people have displayed an incredible level of generosity in their support and pledges of accommodation.<\/p> <p> The Government has moved quickly to ensure a range of supports and measures are in place.  To date there have been 15,294 Ukrainian arrivals here, mostly through Dublin Airport, but also at Shannon and Cork Airports and Rosslare Port.  Dedicated reception facilities have been put in place to provide people with temporary protection and access to other services immediately on arrival.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth's international protection accommodation service has provided accommodation to people who have sought it on arrival here, and as the numbers arriving are increasing, arrangements are being ramped-up to provide accommodation in hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfasts, as well as accommodation pledged by the general public, State or privately owned properties, religious properties and local authority community facilities.  Just over 20,000 pledges of accommodation have been made to the Irish Red Cross to date and the inspection process is now under way and been scaled up.  The first of these properties will be handed over for use this week.  It is hoped that as many of these offers as possible will be crystallised for use.<\/p> <p> All accommodation options are being examined as the situation evolves and planning is ongoing for the medium and longer-term needs that will arise.  Accommodation available through the existing channels may not meet the level of need if increased numbers of people arrive in the weeks ahead.  For this reason, a number of contingency options are in place, including centres such as Millstreet and Citywest, as well as the use of Gormanstown Camp.  Every effort will be made to ensure this type of solution is temporary until more suitable accommodation becomes available.<\/p> <p> Other Departments have also stepped up a crisis response to give immediate support to people arriving here, providing access to personal public service numbers, income and other financial supports, health and social care services and education.  The Government is also working to ensure local capacity and resources are factored into the overall humanitarian response.  Local community and voluntary groups around the country have been mobilising in recent weeks to welcome people into their communities.  As the new arrivals begin to settle in, community response forums will provide enhanced local-level co-ordination for the community and voluntary response in their area.  This will build on the structures and relationships that were highly effective during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p> I thank all the people who have opened their hearts and, in many cases, their homes to people from Ukraine to provide shelter.  Ar sc&aacute;th a ch&eacute;ile a mhaireann na daoine.  It is inspiring to me that following all the sacrifices made over the past two years, the Irish people are once again rolling up their sleeves to provide much-needed help to a country and a people devastated by war.  I repeat that Ireland will stand in solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in the face of the brutal war being inflicted upon them by Russia.  As a country we have never been found wanting in times of crisis and I am certain we will rise to the challenge of this humanitarian crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000028#FF00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648643220,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Like the Taoiseach, I am sure Deputies across the House will join me in condemning in the strongest possible terms the illegal actions of Russia.  Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 26 February, we have witnessed scenes of appalling brutality, including the shelling of civilian areas and women and children huddled in bomb shelters while cities and towns have been levelled.  This is a violent and destructive war that serves absolutely no credible purpose but carries with it an unbearable toll on the people of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  The result of this has been one of the largest humanitarian crises Europe has seen since the end of the Second World War.  There are millions of people fleeing their homes and seeking safety in Poland, Slovakia, other EU member states and Moldova.  Today I will speak about Ireland's humanitarian effort in responding to the crisis in Ukraine, the work done so far, the plan we have set out and the challenges ahead.  At this time we are facing a humanitarian crisis on a scale never before seen in Ireland.  From 25 February until yesterday, 29 March, more than 15,000 people have fled from Ukraine to Ireland, and of these, more than 8,600 are now being accommodated by the State.<\/p>  <p>  Since the outset of this war and within the whole-of-government response, my Department has been focused on providing reception accommodation to Ukrainian refugees in need.  Our goal has been to provide shelter and safety.  We have established a new Ukraine unit in my Department to handle the accommodation needs, with officials seconded from across the Department and other Departments to support this effort.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge and pay tribute to many of the officials in my Department working tirelessly seven days every week to source accommodation, as well as those who have volunteered to staff airport and reception hubs, often working throughout the night.<\/p> <p>In addition to quickly establishing a new unit within the Department, we have also been working to develop immediate, medium-term and long-term plans to accommodate those arriving.  Those leading the Ukraine unit have been working with the Defence Forces on planning and developing a strategy to ensure efficiency and effectiveness as we move through this crisis.  Currently, the vast majority of those being accommodated by the State are being accommodated in hotels.  To date we have contracted almost 3,000 hotel rooms across the country.  Given the ability of the State to contract hotels at scale and at pace, this has provided the bulk of the initial emergency response.  However, there are limits on the ability of hotels to accommodate all those fleeing given the potential numbers.  Measures need to be put in place to respond to this.<br\/><br\/>The Government has worked with the Irish Red Cross to put in place a national pledge as the mechanism for channelling the offers of accommodation which many members of the public wish to provide.  The website through which offers of accommodation can be pledged is <i>registerofpledges.redcross.ie<\/i>.  There has been a remarkable response by the public with more than 22,000 pledges received so far.  The Irish Red Cross, the Defence Forces and estate agents and valuers are now working to evaluate those pledges and inspect the properties with a view to making them available quickly to refugees.  They are focusing first on vacant properties which make up just under 5,000 of the 22,000 pledges.  The Irish Red Cross and my Department will then begin to match refugees to properties and to support refugees to move on to their new homes.<br\/><br\/>The Government, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Red Cross and Tusla have been working together to develop a vetting process for donors of shared accommodation.  This is where a room or rooms have been offered to Ukrainian refugees in people's homes.  As children constitute a significant proportion of the Ukrainian refugees currently arriving in Ireland, child protection has to be a priority.  For this reason anyone offering a room or rooms in a shared home will have to be vetted before Ukrainian refugees are matched them.  Deputies will appreciate the importance of ensuring the safety of people who may be vulnerable and are traumatised by the terrible experiences which they have recently undergone.  I would ask for patience as the Red Cross works through this process.  In the six years since the original pledge system was put in place by the Irish Red Cross, there were 600 pledges of accommodation in total.  There have now been 22,000 pledges in the last three weeks.  This is an enormous ramping up of the level of generosity and the level of offers from the Irish people.  It is going to take some time to work through them all.<br\/><br\/>I want to thank everybody who has pledged support.  I would also like to thank the Red Cross volunteers and staff who worked to facilitate that unprecedented level of offers.  The generosity of the Irish people and of the NGO community constitutes a beacon of hope for people who have lost so much.  I know from talking to refugees and to the Ukrainian ambassador how much that generosity is deeply appreciated.<br\/><br\/>Since the outbreak of this crisis I have been clear that all options are on the table when it comes to accommodation of those fleeing Ukraine.  We are in advanced discussions with Airbnb and The Open Community regarding temporary accommodation being provided around Ireland to those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.  It is anticipated that these discussions will conclude in the coming days and further information will then be provided.  The Department is continuing to engage with religious orders to identify properties which may be suitable for use as accommodation for those fleeing Ukraine.<br\/><br\/>Given that this is a crisis situation I have to be honest with the public and with those fleeing here.  This is the greatest humanitarian crisis Ireland has ever faced.  More than 15,000 people have fled here in just over a month with more than half of them now accommodated by the State.  This response will get more challenging in the weeks and months ahead.  The accommodation available through local authorities, religious organisations, State bodies and pledged accommodation is unlikely to meet the level of need should the higher estimated numbers of people arriving come to pass in the weeks ahead.  Current modelling suggests that there is an inevitability to moving into an emergency accommodation phase when pledged and other service supply is exhausted.  The only question is how quickly this phase is reached.  As such, we have put in place a number of contingency options.  These include the use of arenas and conference centres as well as the use of Gormanstown camp.  It will not be own-door and it may mean camp beds in shared spaces.  It is not our first preference, however I think it is right that we plan for these contingency options if they are needed and that we are always in a position to provide safety and shelter to those fleeing this war.<br\/><br\/>It would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge the wider questions the Ukraine crisis asks of our migration and asylum systems.  Last year we published a White Paper which set out how we would end direct provision and move to a new system based on human rights and integration from day one.  I do not believe the compassion of the Irish public stops at Europe's borders.  I know from the correspondence I have received, alongside years of activism across the country, that the Irish people want to see a kind and compassionate welcome to all those who come here in need, no matter where they come from.  Undoubtedly the Ukrainian crisis puts extra pressure on my Department in terms of implementing the White Paper.  At the end of February IPAS was accommodating just over 8,000 people.  That number has since doubled and it will continue to grow.  However, and I want to say this clearly, our commitment to ending direct provision will not waver.<br\/><br\/>To those who say we cannot or should not take people seeking refuge here, I think we can say now beyond all doubt that the Irish people have resoundingly shown that we are a nation of welcomes.  We have shown that we want asylum, reception and integration processes that are compassionate and that afford equal dignity to everybody seeking protection.Although the challenges ahead are daunting, we will meet our obligations to the people fleeing here because when we see the destruction brought to Ukraine by the Russian invasion, when we see the devastation and death that have been caused, we know the offer of shelter and safety is the least of what we must do for those who are so badly in need.<br\/><br\/>Our response will need to be not just an all-of-government approach but an all-of-society approach.  Those arriving will need a welcome and support from local community organisations, schools and sports clubs, residents' associations and employers.  This is why the role of community fora, the community call as it was called during Covid, is going to be so important.  There may be gaps in provision in the weeks ahead and I have no doubt there will be difficulties.  We need patience and support from Deputies and particularly from the wider public as we develop what will be an extraordinarily complex and unprecedented operation.  This is a humanitarian challenge which Ireland can and will meet.  We are brave and kind enough as a country to do so.  I ask for all Deputies to work with the Government as we work through this enormous challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000029#GG00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648643820,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter.  We all see on a daily basis the horrific images of what is happening in Ukraine.  War in Europe is not something any of us had comprehended but it is a situation that Ireland must respond to.  Ukrainian citizens are arriving here severely traumatised as they face the loss of family and friends, as they worry about those they have left behind, and as they arrive in a strange country having lost their jobs, their income and all their belongings.  Their entire world has been turned upside down in the last few weeks and it is our duty to help them.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to today&rsquo;s debate and, in particular, to outline to the House how my Department is responding to the situation.  Along with colleagues from other Departments, officials from my Department are responding in a sensitive and caring way and we are doing all we can to ensure that those who need our help will receive it as quickly as possible.  The House will be aware that a welcome facility is operating at Dublin Airport where officials from my Department and the Department of Justice are available to meet arrivals from Ukraine.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I opened that facility a number of weeks ago at the onset of the crisis and it is working very well. <\/p>  <p>  The steps being taken by my Department fall into three categories, namely, issuing personal public service, PPS, numbers, providing immediate income support, and providing access to child benefit.  All income support claims are being fast-tracked for processing and all resources are being made available to ensure PPS numbers and payments are issued as quickly as possible.  Immediate income support is being provided in the form of supplementary allowance, which is payable at rates up to &euro;206 per week, with increases for adult and child dependants.<\/p>  <p>  To give a sense of the scale of the issue, I will share some basic numbers with the House.<\/p> <p>To date, personal public service, PPS, numbers have been issued to more than 14,000 Ukrainian citizens, comprising just under 10,000 women and girls and 4,000 men and boys.  Supplementary welfare allowance already has been paid in respect of more than 9,000 people, while child benefit is being paid for almost 4,000 children.<br\/><br\/>As well as the facility at Dublin Airport, we have established a number of additional dedicated welcome centres at Cork Street in Dublin and in Cork and Limerick cities.  My Department is working closely on this with the Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, as well as the international protection accommodation services in these locations.  We also are working closely with the Department of Justice to ensure people coming here on each ferry at Rosslare Port are met on their arrival.  Interpretation services are being provided, where required, to assist Ukrainian citizens to access my Department's services and application forms.  Information on supports is available in both Ukrainian and Russian.  A dedicated web page has been published on the Department's website to ensure those arriving from Ukraine are aware of the supports and services available to them.  This page has been translated into both Ukrainian and Russian.<br\/><br\/>Once people have had an opportunity to settle in, we will arrange to provide the most appropriate social welfare payment, which, depending on individuals' circumstances, could include the one-parent family payment, disability allowance or jobseeker's payment.  As Deputies know, many people arriving from Ukraine are anxious to support themselves and already are making efforts to seek employment.  Fortunately, many of them have been successful in obtaining jobs and I know many employers are seeking to offer them work.  My Department is putting in place plans to roll out job search and employment supports in order that those seeking employment can receive the assistance they require.  A number of Deputies have been in touch about businesses that have employment opportunities for Ukrainians.  Employers can email <i>employer@welfare.ie<\/i>if they wish to register their interest in offering work opportunities to Ukrainian citizens arriving in Ireland.  My officials will work closely with employers, as well as with education and training boards, in order that any training and language supports that are needed can be provided.<br\/><br\/>It is important, however, that we give people the necessary time and space to get settled after they arrive here.  They have been through an extremely traumatic experience and their immediate concern is naturally for their children and the loved ones they have left behind.  For those who want and are ready to look for a job, my Department is here to help and we will assist in matching them with employers.<br\/><br\/>I thank the staff in the Department of Social Protection, who, over the past two years, responded in an unprecedented way to ensure income support was provided to people during a global pandemic and who are now doing the same again in respect of people arriving from Ukraine.  The work the staff are doing at Dublin Airport and at the reception facilities and local offices around the country is public service at its best.  I really want to acknowledge those efforts in the House today.  We all hope this awful war will end but, in the meantime, we will continue to do everything we can to help.<br\/><br\/>As part of my remit in the Department of Rural and Community Development, I am working with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, to engage with communities.  As the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, said, the community call that was activated during the pandemic certainly will be utilised again to help people.  As a Government, we need the help of everybody.  This is a mammoth task and we will call on all those who are willing to put their shoulder to the wheel.  We will be doing so through the community call and all the different organisations that really stepped up to the mark during the pandemic.  We will call on them again and I know we can rely on them.  We will work with them in every way we can to assist in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000030#HH00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648644420,"counter":256,"content":"<p>First, I want to record again our absolute condemnation of the actions of Russia in invading Ukraine and to extend our solidarity to the Ukrainian people at this time.  The actions of the Russian Federation are illegal, brutal and unjust.  No country should be subjected to the kind of military aggression faced by Ukraine.  The priority must be to end this invasion and secure a Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory.  To that end, we hope peace talks in Istanbul will be successful and that peace can prevail.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome yesterday's decision by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to expel four Russian diplomats from the State.  It is now past time for the Government to act in the strongest possible terms by expelling the Russian ambassador.  I say this because the humanitarian crisis that unfolds before us daily demands action at that level - a tough diplomatic stance by Ireland, with no room for ambiguity and with no relief from our absolute rejection of this Russian imperial aggression and this illegal war.  We need to send that message clearly and consistently.  I know the Government has waited for an EU-wide response to this.  There has been, to say the least, a dragging of feet in this regard across the Continent.  Ireland should act now regardless.  The time for putting this matter on the long finger is over.<\/p>  <p>  As others have stated, Irish people have been very generous in their support for Ukraine and for Ukrainian refugees coming to this country.  This illustrates the solidarity there is with the people of Ukraine.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, that this human instinct extends to all refugees and to everyone seeking international protection in our country.  The solidarity and generosity of our people now begs that the Government set out a clear and comprehensive plan for our response to this crisis.  I appreciate the updates from the Ministers today and I commend the work done thus far.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have to ask questions about the accommodation needs, particularly in the medium and long term, of Ukrainian families feeling to our shores seeking safety.  The Government needs to move beyond short-term planning, as necessary as it is now, and wide generalisations, towards being very specific.  The Irish Red Cross, as ever, is agile and effective.  I record our appreciation of its effort.  However, what is required to accommodate people and to end direct provision - the commitment in that regard has been reiterated in the House - will be a very ambitious and radically different approach to housing and accommodation from what we have seen thus far.<\/p>  <p>  I want to mention two additional matters.  The first relates to mental health supports for families and children, in particular, who come here.  We know our services are under pressure anyway.  We need a sense from the Government of what will be done in terms of increased capacity and resources in order that every child, irrespective of whether they are Ukrainian, Afghan, Syrian or Irish, will have his or her needs met.  Second, I note the need for real, tangible support for the community groups and grassroots activists who will embrace those seeking international protection.<\/p>  <p>  Everything possible must be done to ensure a diplomatic and peaceful end to the invasion of Ukraine happens as soon as possible.  The Ukrainians are the best placed to judge Russia's intentions and announcements that it is scaling back its military operations.  So far, they simply do not buy it.  Indeed, the words of the Ukrainian President, that the positive signs \"do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells\", sums up the situation and is a powerful reminder of the sheer brutality of this attack.  It must end.  Russia must cease its illegal and unjust actions and withdraw.<\/p> <p>On that point, we are undoubtedly united.  Seasaim&iacute;d leis an &Uacute;cr&aacute;in ag an am seo.

I will focus on the issue of children.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work done to date by the various Departments and Ministers.  I am aware that much of the work is the responsibility of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  The circumstances are unprecedented.  A huge amount of work has been done to date given the situation.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that 78 children have been killed and 105 injured.  The UN suspects the figures are much higher.  Unfortunately, the reality is that they will probably increase over the coming weeks, depending on how long the conflict continues.  The UN estimates that 7.5 million children live in Ukraine.  To put it into context, that would be 2 million members of our entire population.  One in every two children in Ukraine has been displaced.  That amounts to just over 4 million children in total.  Some 1.8 million of these children have fled Ukraine in total.  To put that into context, that is roughly the entire population of Munster and Leinster.  These statistics concern children alone.  Sometimes when we talk about figures, the message can get lost.  It is really frightening to think about the number of affected children.  Their homes have been destroyed or damaged.  In many cases, fathers have left families to fight the invading Russian army.  The children&rsquo;s schools, cr&egrave;ches, play parks, playgrounds and everything they took for granted have been totally decimated and taken away from them.<\/p>  <p>  There are reports that orphanages have been targeted.  Neonatal facilities have been affected.  We saw reports of maternity hospitals destroyed by missile attacks.  No adult here can imagine how frightening this would be.  Imagine being a child in that situation and not knowing what is going on, although picking up on your parents&rsquo; fear.  Can you imagine trying to keep it together for the sake of your children when you do not really know what is going on yourself?  There really are no words sometimes.  It is just devastating to think of all those children who, in many cases, do not have access to safe drinking water, healthcare, electricity and heating.  Food and medical supplies are dwindling in many circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  We know from other conflicts that children fleeing the war in Ukraine are at greater risk of human trafficking and exploitation.  We need to be conscious of that.  It was mentioned earlier today in the Chamber that an estimated 6,000 unaccompanied minors have left Ukraine for Ireland and other European countries.  We need to be very cognisant of the chaos and confusion.  The movement of large numbers of refugees makes it very easy to exploit vulnerable children.  Recent reports suggest that 500 unaccompanied children have crossed over the border into Romania alone.  The threat children face is real and growing and we really have to do everything in our power to address it.<\/p>  <p>  The whole situation needs to be addressed; however, where unaccompanied minors are concerned, we all have an image of children standing alone or being left totally by themselves.  What they have already faced is horrific.  We definitely need to ensure they have the safety and protection they so deserve.<\/p>  <p>  While there is an immediate threat to life, it is the hidden or less publicised consequences of this war that will follow children into adulthood.  This leads into what Deputy McDonald said about mental health supports.  The latter will be critical.  Is there a possibility of ascertaining whether we can link schools to some sort of mental health support, particularly where refugees will be attending?  Could appropriate play therapy or some sort of regional service in schools and cr&egrave;ches be made available?  Schools might provide an easy means of access.  We should have access to those services anyway.  It might be something we could consider.  We need to be cognisant of terminally ill children, children in intensive care and children awaiting life-saving surgery, speech and language therapy or routine developmental checks.  We must also be cognisant of what happens to them.<\/p>  <p>  I heard a story from my local hospital that concerned women who had gone through or were in the middle of breast cancer treatment.  They arrived here, obviously with no medical information or files, and the hospital was trying to figure out what types of tumours they had and what type of chemotherapy was appropriate.  These are matters one would not even think about.  We just need to be cognisant of this when asking Departments, hospitals and all our education and childcare services to take on all the extra work.  We need to ensure they are supported and resourced to do it. <\/p>  <p>  NGOs have already observed a reduction in vaccination and childhood immunisation, such as for measles and polio.  Again, we need to consider children&rsquo;s access to all the normal developmental checks.  We need to be cognisant of how the war affects children&rsquo;s physical health and all the normal things we take for granted, such as going for a vaccine.  All the mental health considerations also need to be taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000032#KK00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1648645020,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I express solidarity with the Ukrainian people.  I warmly welcome the many thousands of Ukrainians who have fled to Ireland to seek protection.  I recognise the warmth, generosity of spirit and community involvement exhibited right across the island of Ireland towards those Ukrainian citizens, primarily women and children, who have sought refuge.  The response of the Irish has to be commended.  I include the efforts of people such as Colette Talbot, Nicole Browne and David Whyte from my county, Wicklow.  They have just returned after delivering badly needed humanitarian supplies at the Ukrainian border.  People such as Neil Treanor and Willie Coster, and many others, are still there helping to address the refugee crisis.  The scale of the humanitarian crisis and the sheer human cost of this war mean the number of war refugees whom we anticipate will reach Ireland over the coming months could well run to more than 200,000.  The EU needs to adopt an approach to dealing with the humanitarian fallout from the war in Ukraine that is similar to that developed to assist Europe in the recovery after Covid.  Maximising the effectiveness of our response in Ireland will require a cross-party approach.  The Government now faces the responsibility of putting in place the necessary systems to deal with the demands that have arisen from the unprecedented situation.  The fluidity of the situation places a responsibility on the Government to ensure the Opposition is kept fully informed and briefed continually as to what is happening.  There is also a need to put in place a single point of contact for Members of the Oireachtas to provide information concerning the broad swathe of public services that Deputies are being, and will be, called upon to source for refugees in their constituencies.<\/p>  <p>  Next week, I will be part of a delegation from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs that will visit eastern Europe, where we will examine how countries such as Moldova and Romania are attempting to deal with the refugee crisis.  While we will be holding high-level meetings with our European counterparts, we will also be visiting border crossings to witness at first hand the scale of the exodus from Ukraine.  We will also be attempting to identify the needs of the refugees and the efforts Ireland can make at source to alleviate some of their suffering.  The ferocity, inhumanity and deliberate targeting of civilian targets apparent in the Russian strategy mean those who have fled the war are seriously traumatised by what they witnessed and have had to endure.  The majority of the refugees are women and children.  Large numbers of children are crossing the Ukrainian border unaccompanied.  Some of these have arrived in Ireland traumatised and vulnerable.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>There are also reports that vulnerable refugees are facing further threats from human traffickers who are targeting women and children at border crossings.  We need to develop a presence on the ground to work with local authorities to help to guarantee the safety of vulnerable refugees.<\/p> <p> Ambassadors from Poland, Moldova and Romania appeared before a committee recently.  The Ukrainian ambassador appealed to the Government to charter aircraft to bring refugees directly from refugee centres at the Ukrainian border, where there has been an increase in congestion and overcrowding, because overpricing is preventing refugees who have lost everything from securing flights without assistance.  There is a need to alleviate the pressure before it precipitates a further humanitarian crisis in refugee centres.<\/p> <p> I also want to welcome the decision by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to investigate allegations of price gouging by Ryanair, allegations made by the Ukrainian ambassador.  It is important that a message goes out that Ireland will not tolerate any war profiteering.  I look forward to hearing the outcome of the Minister's investigation.<\/p> <p> Today, we have also heard reports that people are now starving to death in Mariupol.  Russia needs to facilitate humanitarian corridors to allow life preserving supplies to reach besieged civilians.  It is also important to note that Russia is blockading Ukrainian ports and preventing badly needed food supplies, in particular grain, from leaving for poorer countries which are highly dependent on Ukraine as a source of grain.  Ireland has a responsibility to use its role on the UN Security Council and at EU level to ensure that international focus is maintained on the food crisis in other sites of humanitarian crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000032#KK00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648645620,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I again express solidarity with the people of Ukraine for the turmoil the country has been put into and the vicious war that has been orchestrated from the Russian Federation which has cost the lives of so many and has scattered people all over the world.  Some have come to Ireland.  In my local community in County Leitrim, a Ukrainian neighbour of mine, Ivan Tarkovych, worked to get his family here.  I have worked with him and many others in our community.  Tomorrow he is flying to Dubrovnik, I understand, to bring back a whole lot of people from his community in a minibus.<\/p>  <p>  There have been major efforts made locally by huge numbers of people in the community.  A Facebook page has been set up and beds, linen and everything else people could possibly need has been donated.  People have come forward to offer their homes, holiday homes and all kinds of other accommodation.  That is the kind of community effort we see when people in Ireland step up to the mark.  What is happening is tremendous.  Like other Deputies, I want to commend the work the Government has done.  In fairness, a huge effort has been made to try to make sure we do everything we possibly can to assist these people.<\/p>  <p>  Last Monday week, I was in Donegal where 156 people from Ukraine have been housed in an emergency accommodation centre.  I spoke to a lot of them.  Many of the issues they raised concerned qualifications and how they would be matched.  There were doctors, nurses, teachers and people with various other qualifications we require in this country.  They are unsure as to how they will fit into our healthcare system and other services.  They want to get assistance with that.  I understand that one of the ways in which they can be assisted is through adult education officers in ETBs.  There is a clear difficulty in trying to ensure the numbers coming have the adequate information they need.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of days, local authorities and county councils have met in order to put together a strategy around that.  They are also in the dark.  I spoke to people from Leitrim County Council yesterday who did not know how many refugees had come to Leitrim or how many would come.  They did not know whether an emergency accommodation centre would be set up.  It is the same in every county.  There is a little breakdown in communications that need to be resolved, and that needs to happen as urgently as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Many Ukrainian people who come here have huge trauma, but there is also a great sense of gratitude that they are being helped and looked after.  There is a great sense of gratitude that they are able to get payments.  They want to work, and are anxious to get work as quickly as possible.  Many have already started work.  They want to contribute, and pay a little bit of rent to people offering accommodation for free to them.  That is all positive, and we need to encourage and work with that.<\/p>  <p>  After all of this, we need to reflect on something in a European context.  I have dealt with refugees for the past two decades.  Many came to an old direct provision centre in Ballinamore in Leitrim for many years, and another centre opened in the past two years.  Whether they are from Syria, North Africa or wherever else, when children have had turmoil and hardship in their lives their tears are the same.  It does not matter what distance they have travelled.  There is an EU-Ukrainian association agreement, which can be set out as the reason we treat these asylum seekers or refugees differently.  However, for me and the vast majority of Irish people who want to welcome them, it is a problem that we need to deal with.<\/p>  <p>  It is not appropriate that we deal with one set of refugees differently, regardless of what agreements are in place or an international lobby tells us is the case.  The reality is that the people who need help should get it, and they should get equal help regardless of where they have come from or what circumstances they have travelled in.  They have come from war or have experienced human rights abuses where they lived, and have come here to seek shelter.  We should try to do that in a more humane way than we have done in the past, in the very same way that we are providing assistance for Ukrainian people who are coming here now.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the point at hand, I want to pay tribute to the work of the Red Cross.  I have spoken to Liam O'Dwyer in the Red Cross on a number of occasions over the past few weeks.  It is overwhelmed by what has happened and the number of people who are coming here.  <\/p>  <p>  Housing will be the greatest difficulty.  We need to face that fact.  We talk in here every day about the housing crisis facing so many Irish people who cannot find accommodation.  Thousands are coming here.  We have to be very careful that tensions do not arise, something that can happen very easily.  The first day we put up the page \"Leitrim Helps Ukraine\" a couple of people talked about our own.  In fairness, such comments were drowned out by the hundreds of people who said that we have a responsibility to help.  The Government has a job of work to do to get this right.  <\/p>  <p>  In fairness, so far there has been a reasonably decent job done, but there are difficulties with communications and ensuring people know exactly what rights they will have and how they can integrate well in assisting those they want to assist.  It is to be hoped that if we get a huge influx like we are expecting over the coming weeks, the Government will put the shoulder to the wheel and ensure we provide the level of assistance that people are so determined to provide.  The ordinary decent people of Ireland are up for this, and we need to show that the Government is up for it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000033#LL00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1648645620,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Labour Party about the crisis in Ukraine and the governmental response.  I want to first express my solidarity and that of my party with the people of Ukraine who have now endured an entire month of the brutal bombardment and horrific onslaught represented by the Russian invasion.  Despite some indications in recent days of the scaling down of the siege on Kyiv, there is no indication that this horrendous suffering will end soon.  We know just how brutal Putin's imperial regime is.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that we are standing here in this peaceful corner of Europe, while on the other side of Europe we are seeing an unthinkable atrocity being perpetrated which has unfolded within such a swift passage of time.  That is one of the reasons it is so truly shocking to us.  The war is a crime, and there has undoubtedly been a huge array of war crimes committed by Russian forces in the course of the war.  Yesterday, I spoke in the House about having attended the funeral of Pierre Zakrzewski.  We owe him, his colleague, Oleksandra Kuvshynova , who was killed alongside him in a an attack outside Kyiv, and other war reporters a great debt of gratitude for shining a spotlight on the atrocities being committed by Russia and the suffering being endured by the Ukrainian people.  Without that sort of front-line reporting, we would not be as aware of the scale of the appalling devastation being endured by Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, it is particularly shocking because it is happening in Europe.  It is particularly shocking because of the speed with which it has unfolded and scale of the devastation that has been caused.  <\/p> <p>We are witnessing the appalling siege of the people of Mariupol, as well as 4 million people having fled their own country into other EU states in the course of just over four weeks.  Of course, we are also witnessing yet another manifestation of the brutal rule of Vladimir Putin.  It brings to mind the sort of war Putin conducted through proxy in recent history, such as through Assad in Syria.  We saw the brutal siege of Aleppo and the enormous suffering of the Syrian people under that attack.  It also brings to mind other wars being conducted on other peoples who are enduring and suffering brutal bombardment.  I am thinking in particular of the people of Yemen in what is sometimes referred to as a forgotten war, but which is an absolutely brutal war of which, again, civilians are bearing a significant brunt and which is being waged largely through complicity by proxy with Saudi Arabia.  I was glad to stand outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Dublin on Saturday to protest that war and the war in Ukraine.<\/p> <p> Looking at the State's response, it is clear there has been an enormous and very welcome outpouring of generosity among all communities across Ireland.  I acknowledge the speed and generosity with which the Government has responded.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and O'Gorman, spoke about some of the ways in which the Government has responded.  I was glad to visit the Ukraine support centre nearest to me, located on Cork Street in Dublin 8, just last week and to meet officials of the Department of Social Protection and staff who had volunteered from the Citizens Information Services, the Department of Justice and other State entities.  Those officials adapting so swiftly in order to assist people arriving from Ukraine is true public service.  I visited volunteer-run service at the free shop on Clarendon Street, only 100 m from Leinster House, which has been set up by several volunteers to provide necessary and basic items for Ukrainian families and individuals fleeing here, some of whom I have met.  I am told and know from those whom I have met that some of them have come with no more than a change of clothes.  Their needs are extreme.  As other Members have stated, many of them have left behind loved ones - fathers, husbands or parents - in Ukraine.  The scale of human suffering is evident and it is welcome to see the great generosity with which this State has responded and the opening of our doors to 15,000 people.<\/p> <p> There are several points that we need to consider because it is clear the need is extensive and the scale of the challenge is immense.  We know there have been immensely strong offers of support.  The Red Cross is doing exceptionally important and impressive work in co-ordinating those offers.  We know also that it may come to a situation where, as the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, stated, we will have to look at short-term housing measures.  I have indicated to him and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, that there is capacity to provide, for example, Sprung structures, as temporary accommodation on an emergency basis.  My colleague Senator Moynihan has pointed out as Labour Party spokesperson on housing the need for a longer-term housing strategy and to ensure there is a revision to the Housing for All strategy and a whole-of-government response should the housing need endure for longer in the event of there being no short-term end to the war.<\/p> <p> There are concerns relating to the schooling of the many children who are coming here.  It is welcome to see the way in which schools are opening their doors, as well as initiatives such as the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, taking on the provision of information in Ukrainian and Russian to families and parents to enable a smooth transition into schools here.  On a recent visit to Ballyvaughan in County Clare I saw the fantastic community response, including the school response, to those coming here and fleeing such devastation.  On the schooling issue, we need to ensure all the necessary supports are provided for, particularly language supports.<\/p> <p> On the issue of arrival into the country, although the Ukraine support centres and the centre at Dublin Airport have been impressive and superb, we still need to ensure there is a central point of contact and that, no matter where refugees come into the country, they receive the same level of supports.  My colleague Deputy Howlin spoke last week about the concerns in Rosslare, where volunteers were doing a significant amount of work.  I think that matter has been addressed but it is certainly the case that we need to ensure there are sufficient levels of support at Shannon and Cork airports and wherever else refugees are arriving.<\/p> <p> As regards employment prospects, all present, including the many Members who have met Ukrainians coming here, are very conscious that many of those coming here are highly skilled.  Many of them are able to continue working if they had been working remotely in Ukraine.  All of them are anxious to get work and jobs.  I very much welcome the highlighting by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, of the employer mechanism but, again, supports will be required.  As a trade unionist, I am concerned to ensure that nobody coming here will be exploited.  We must ensure that people are protected, especially those who do not have sufficient levels of English-language skills.  I commend SIPTU and other unions for committing to provide refugees with information on workers' rights and job prospects here in their own language.  That is a welcome initiative.<\/p> <p> I refer to other ways in which we in Ireland can show support for Ukraine.  It is clear that one such way is through our welcome of refugees here and our provision of humanitarian aid, to which the Taoiseach referred.  At diplomatic level, we should be using all the non-military means at our disposal as a neutral State to support Ukraine and its accession to the EU.  I am really glad the Minister, Deputy Coveney, indicated that support along with a small number of other EU states.  I welcome his action in the context of the expulsion of diplomats.  I very much welcomed the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday which, as it happened, was in response to my question on Leaders' Questions in respect of the expulsion of four senior officials from the Russian Embassy here.  I believe we should go further and now move to expel the Russian ambassador.  We did act not across the EU 27 but as one of a small number of EU states that moved to expel diplomats yesterday.  I welcome that because it is an important diplomatic means at our disposal to express our condemnation of Russia's brutality in the strongest possible terms.  However, we should go further now and expel the Russian ambassador.<\/p> <p> As one who has always been a member of an internationalist party, for us in the Labour Party, a member of the Party of European Socialists, it is important that we stand up against this assault on democracy and the sovereignty of a peaceful and democratic state that we are seeing unfolding before our eyes.  That is why we need to take all the measures that are available to us to show our support for Ukraine and its people, as well as the Ukrainian Government and President Zelenskiy.<\/p> <p> I conclude by expressing my welcome for the fact that President Zelenskiy will address this House next week.  I ask that his address be live broadcast.  It is very important.  Many people will want to watch the address as it comes to us.  I know that many Ukrainian citizens who are now here in Ireland may like to come to the House to watch that address.  If that were possible, it would be a welcome gesture.  I presume the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E. Larysa Gerasko, whom I have met on several occasions, will be here, but it would be a positive gesture of solidarity with the Ukrainian people to have a strong presence in the House of the Ukrainian community and members of that community here in Ireland.<\/p> <p> I again ask that we use all means at our disposal to convey our strong condemnation of Russia and our strong solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they endure this horrific onslaught.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000033#LL00300","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648646220,"counter":264,"content":"<p>From the response we have seen from the Government which has been outlined in the House today it is obvious that we, as a State, have done a significant amount so far to support Ukrainian war refugees coming to Ireland for safety while their country continues to suffer an unconscionable attack from Russia.  We have reacted quickly in putting processes in place to welcome Ukrainians coming to Ireland and we have facilitated through practical means the compassion that the Irish people feel at this difficult time.<\/p>  <p>  The Red Cross has received thousands of pledges from members of the public to accommodate Ukrainian refugees and, as Ukrainians get to know our communities, schools and workplaces in the coming period, more strong bonds between Ukrainian people and Irish people will be formed.  For many years, our country has benefited from the presence of the existing Ukrainian community here.  Of course, since February, Ukrainians have arrived here in dreadful circumstances and for reasons we fervently wish never had to be.  Notwithstanding that, we are looking forward to getting to know the newest members of the Ukrainian community in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>We hope that their time in Ireland will allow them to create fond memories and strong friendships, despite the distress that this situation has brought about.  It is important to acknowledge that the vast majority of Ukrainians do not wish to be here and want to be home and to return home.  It will be our duty to give them the opportunities while they are here and when this war ends, to rebuild that beautiful country to make it fit again for the Ukrainian people.<\/p> <p> This Friday, Ireland and Ukraine will celebrate 30 years of diplomatic relations.  Ukraine declared its independence in August 1991 and in the following year Ireland and Ukraine formally established relations.  Since then the ties have only grown between our two nations and in recent years Ukraine has pursued closer association with the European Union.  The European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement, which we fully support and was not supported by all parties in this House, has allowed Ukraine to pursue closer association with the European Union and is very much what the Ukrainian people want, and what Putin does not want, which is a deepened co-operation between the European Union and Ukraine.  We are very proud in this country to support the signing of the association agreement and to see the work that Ukraine has done since then, as envisaged in the agreement.  <\/p> <p> We all know that in 2014, Ukraine was invaded by Russia and indeed the D&aacute;il condemned that at the time.  I am glad to see that the condemnation this year is unanimous as it was not at that time.  From 2014 Russia has illegally occupied the Crimean Peninsula.  I hope that those who accepted that at the time have changed their minds by now.  Russia has also stoked separatist agitation in Donbas.  Again, both are inherent parts of Ukrainian territory.  Ireland has always been unwavering in its stance that Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be upheld.<\/p> <p> Since 24 February this year the country has been under large-scale attack in a dramatic escalation of aggression.  Ireland has used its voice, including at the UN Security Council, to denounce Russia&rsquo;s aggression and to call for an immediate ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Russian troops.  In the midst of all of this, our 30-year anniversary of diplomatic relations offers an opportunity to reflect on the strength of the relationship between Ireland and Ukraine and on the insistence of both countries on their sovereign and independent statehood.  This dark period has shown us that the Ukrainian people&rsquo;s desire for freedom, democracy and independence will never be extinguished.  The Ukrainian people&rsquo;s European choice and EU perspective is clear and Ireland supports Ukraine fully in that aim.  <\/p> <p> I am delighted with the strong words that the Taoiseach has consistently given on that EU perspective.  Ireland has stood with Ukraine for the 30 years of our diplomatic relations.  We opened an embassy last summer and we stand firmly with Ukraine now more than ever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000034#MM00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648646820,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I join with the Minister of State&rsquo;s closing words there that Ireland indeed stands with Ukraine.  We have sincerely felt that across all parties in the D&aacute;il over the past few months.<\/p>  <p>  At this point over 4 million refugees have now fled Ukraine across borders into Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, and so on.  This country has welcomed people with open arms and we have embraced anybody who has wanted to come here.  This is unanimous from listening to people today.  We have provided accommodation and social welfare supports for people who are arriving and we have welcomed refugees into all of our communities across the country.  The majority of Deputies have had some interaction with families as they have arrived.  That has been a great thing to see right across the country.  Not too far from here, some people prevaricated in those refugees&rsquo; moment of need.  Thankfully, Ireland did not waver and opened its doors.<\/p>  <p>  The one-stop shop in Dublin Airport is working very efficiently.  We have a concern as steps are being taken to provide for similar models in Shannon and Cork.  Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his closing comments, address what is happening in Cork and Shannon in taking the necessary steps to have a one-stop shop in place in both of those areas?<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny referred to the need to cross-reference the skill set that many of these refugees are bringing with them with needs in the medicine or engineering fields, for example.  Many of them may be teachers who can, perhaps, help in the months ahead.  Can the Minister address in his closing comments what steps we are taking to catalogue their skills as they are arriving in the country?  How best we can utilise them, as I have said, in the coming months?  Many of the Ukrainian people I have spoken to who have arrived in Cork feel they have something to contribute to the new society and homes while they are here, and want to do so.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to comment on Cork specifically in respect of education and disability provision.  The Minister is very familiar with the problems we have there at this point in time.  I have serious concerns about an influx of a large number of people because the service provision within various community healthcare organisations, CHOs, across the country at the moment is not up to standard.  CHO 4 in Cork is one of those areas.  I have serious misgivings about our ability to provide adequately for any of those students who may come with needs, particularly in respect of mental health services, for example in regard to assessments of needs, autism supports or whatever the case may be.  The majority of schools in Cork city are full at present, which is a major concern for us. There are only two secondary schools on my side of the city which would have any capacity to take any of these people who are fleeing from Ukraine.  That is also something we need to look at.<\/p>  <p>  On direct provision, the Minister said in his opening comments that we are still adhering to the White Paper commitment that direct provision will be wound down by 2024.  This emergency poses a real challenge for us to meet that target.  I would very much like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that.  I know he is saying we intend to stick to that aim, but I sincerely believe it is inevitable that in winding down direct provision, as abhorrent a system as it was, there will be knock-on consequences for what we are aiming to do there.  I would appreciate a comment from the Minister on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  On our diplomatic response, I was one of the people who came out at a very early stage to call for the expulsion of Russian diplomats and staff.  I have no problem in echoing that sentiment again today and will do so at every opportunity.  Ireland should use its position on the UN Security Council as best we can.  The single greatest message we can send is that as a member of the UN Security Council, we are calling for that publicly.<\/p>  <p>  I also ask what consideration is being given to possible diplomatic sanctions on any state that supports Russia.  I am commenting here, in particular, on Belarus.  We need to scrutinise what its involvement is.<\/p>  <p>  My final point relates to the Opposition.  I will not attempt to score political points about previous voting records, etc., in the European Parliament, but I will challenge the Deputies opposite on one point.  I was hoping to say it to their leader earlier.  I think that at European level, they are part of the same party - The Left group - as MEPs Flanagan, Wallace and Daly.  I believe these people need to called out for their position.  They are an embarrassment to this country.  I would appreciate any efforts that the Opposition parties might make in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000035#NN00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1648646820,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I welcome the more than 14,000 Ukrainian people who have already arrived into Ireland.  A couple of weeks ago they could not possibly have imagined packing up their lives and moving to the far side of this Continent.  I hope that their time here, whether long- or short-lived, brings them the safety and support they so badly need and deserve.<\/p>  <p>  Ukrainians arriving at Dublin Airport are being met by a welcome group - a team of Department officials who are helping them to set up PPS numbers and get access to social welfare support.  I thank the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman, Humphreys and McEntee, for putting together that seamless emergency process.<\/p>  <p>  More than 20,000 Irish people have pledged accommodation through the Red Cross.  Right now, there are hundreds of Ukrainian refugees in hotels in my constituency and education welfare officers are working tirelessly to find school places for hundreds of children in my area.  Last week, Frances Fitzgerald MEP, Councillor Vicki Casserly and I visited St. Andrew's National School in Lucan, where a Ukrainian child has been enrolled in the primary school there.  In Palmerstown, a family I know have taken in a 16-year-old Ukrainian teenager who had no family to stay with.  Collections are happening in schools right across my constituency and in community centres such as Rathcoole Community Centre.  The kindness which characterises so many Irish people is the sense of not just wanting to help but needing to help.  I know of barbers offering free haircuts to Ukrainian refugees, of cr&egrave;ches offering free childcare places and of businesses looking to employ Ukrainian people who are available for work.<\/p> <p>However, as a Government, we certainly would not encourage any Ukrainian person to take up work immediately.  Instead, people should take a little time to settle in and recover from the trauma of their journey here before they think about contributing to the workforce.  If there are businesses or companies seeking to advertise employment, they can do so on <i>JobsIreland.ie<\/i>.  I was heartened to hear about the Ukrainian pop-up shop in Clarendon Street, which has been set up by a Ukrainian-Irish businessman to provide free clothes, toys, food and essentials.  It is one example of the kindness that is being shown.<br\/><br\/>I commend the work the Government has done to welcome and accommodate people from Ukraine.  More than 7,000 people have been provided with accommodation by the International Protection Accommodation Services so far.  The Minister's Department is working closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice, Tusla and the Irish Red Cross Society to house Ukrainian refugees as quickly as possible and eventually to progress the offers of accommodation that have been made by Irish people into accommodation itself.  It is very important to have contingency options in place should the numbers arriving exceed the accommodation available.  At this point, it is looking very likely that they will.  While we certainly wish for our Ukrainian friends to be able to return home safely as soon as they wish, I doubt that even the most optimistic among us see the war in Ukraine ending soon.  That is why it is essential that we plan for the future and the long term in terms of both accommodating refugees and responding to the international impacts that the war in Ukraine is having on Ireland in respect of the cost of living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000035#NN00300","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648647420,"counter":269,"content":"<p>It is funny to think that, up to a month ago, we were not talking much about Ukraine.  In fact, most people, including me, thought it was called \"the Ukraine\".  Now, we are checking the news throughout the day and opening our hearts and homes to the women and children seeking refuge.  I hope they will be very happy and safe here, that the family members they have left behind to defend their country will be safe and that this war ends sooner rather than later.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work all the Departments are undertaking, but I have just taken a call from somebody working in Naas General Hospital who told me that in the last 24 hours more than 50 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in the emergency department and the department is at breaking point.  These people are traumatised and they also face a language barrier.  We have to do better for them.  The mental health section in Naas General Hospital is chronically understaffed and will not be in any position to meet what is coming.<\/p>  <p>  The most important response we can make to the Ukrainian crisis is in pursuit of peace.  We know that it does not take long for a war to take on a life of its own.  Sinn F&eacute;in made peace in the North and we are certainly urging peace now.  To the Members here who are beating the drums of war, they should know better from their previous employments.  Not even in our wildest dreams could Ireland ever become a significant military power.  Some of them really need to calm themselves.  Ireland was never involved in a war of aggression.  It is seen as an honest broker precisely because it is not a militarised nation.  We are in a unique position to act as peacemakers, being the only European member state on the United Nations Security Council that is not a member of NATO.<\/p>  <p>  On 6 April, President Zelenskiy is due to address the Houses of the Oireachtas.

President Zelenskiy is certainly standing on the shoulders of giants, those giants being his own people who have sacrificed so much as they have resisted the onslaught of the Russian army.

There is no justification for this assault on its sovereign neighbour.  I praise the Ukrainian people for their valiant resistance in the face of this appalling aggression.  I welcome the Government's decision to expel four Russian embassy staff.  I question the reason Russia needs 30 members of staff in its embassy here in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Government is fast-tracking the asylum process for Ukrainian refugees and has not, so far, put a restriction on the number coming here to escape this dreadful conflict.  However, this begs the question as to why this was not done for others fleeing equally terrifying war zones such as Syria and Afghanistan.  While this is a developing situation, I again question the Government's preparedness for the large number of refugees arriving.  We have known for over a month that we will be dealing with large numbers.  The use of State facilities which are currently not in use, such as closed Army barracks, is appropriate as a temporary measure in this type of emergency.  Housing refugees in these numbers is rightly seen as an emergency which warrants rapid and flexible Government action.  Again, however, this begs the further question as to why this type of emergency mindset has not been brought to bear on the housing crisis.  I am told the local authorities are being inundated with correspondence from people on housing waiting lists to see if their applications for housing will be affected.  The message that this is not the case has to be communicated to the general public.  We do not need to leave any space open for far-right groups to propagate their racism and fear.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the dialogue that has opened between Ukraine and Russia and I call on the Government to encourage and assist this in any way it can, especially using its position on the UN Security Council.  This invasion should be brought to an end and the best way to do that is through dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  I have questions on a number of issues.  Has the Government put in place supports for disabled refugees coming to this country?  There is bound to be a significant number and they will need additional support.  I am aware that many disabled people and carers are willing to open their homes to refugees, but they are concerned that they might lose social protection or housing payments.  The message that this is not the case must be communicated to them.  For example, somebody will not lose his or her living alone allowance.  Finally, many refugees coming to this country will be highly qualified in health and social care professions.  Is anything being put in place to examine how those very qualified people could be employed, if they choose, in our very understaffed healthcare system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000036#OO00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1648647420,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this discussion and I thank the Minister for remaining in the Chamber.  I am incredibly proud of the generous and warm welcome that the Irish people have demonstrated to those fleeing the horrific violence in Ukraine.  The collective condemnation of this unacceptable Russian aggression and the heartfelt expression of solidarity with the people of Ukraine speak volumes about our citizens.  I also acknowledge and commend the approach the Government has taken to date.  It moved rapidly and progressively in this humanitarian crisis.  It reacted in a very open manner and that has translated very much into a type of comfort for those who are coming to Ireland.  They recognise that they are very welcome and that we will do what we can to support them.<\/p>  <p>  However, the challenge of what we face is not lost on anybody.  It is going to be very difficult.  As the Minister said earlier, we have never experienced a crisis like this.  It will involve everybody working together as a society and as a Parliament.  This will be a collective effort on our part.  I have spent a great deal of time over the last few weeks working at local level in Wicklow, where there has been a high intake of refugees, particularly in the north Wicklow area.  Groups of volunteers are working across every level of our community.  That is not just a Wicklow thing, but is replicated across the country.  My comments today reflect the feedback I am getting from those volunteers and the people offering support.<\/p>  <p>  I have already spoken to the Minister about some of the feedback I have been receiving, so what I want to convey is that this is not a criticism of the Government.  As I said, the Government's response so far has been good.  However, there are gaps and issues that have to be addressed.  What is seen among the volunteers and the front-line staff is that many are burnt-out at this stage.  Many are facing their own traumas and experiences for which they are not equipped.  We need to be cognisant of that and acknowledge it.  They are working into the early hours, as the Minister will have seen even within his Department and in other Departments.  People are working from 8 a.m. until 3 a.m. trying to provide the necessary supports and, indeed, trying to juggle work and family life.<\/p> <p>A group in Wicklow has come together to cook dinners for each other's families so that once they get home from work they can start to work with the refugees.  This is an incredible level of commitment but it is not sustainable.  At this point in time, the Government needs to provide and put in place more formal structures of support.  The heavy reliance on volunteers and civil society was necessary in the first month and the first phase of this but we need to move on from it.  There needs to be a more clearly co-ordinated and accountable response from the Government.<\/p> <p> From what I have seen to date, what we are missing is a national structure and framework.  We also need to have local structures in place and there needs to be communication between the two structures.  Even when it comes to simple things such as who is in charge, initially I believed the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, was responsible for the whole-of-government response to this humanitarian crisis.  The remit of Minister and the Department is accommodation.  At this stage we need a Minister who has sole responsibility to drive this response, to bring all of the various Departments together and make sure we have a co-ordinated whole-of-government response and framework in place.  We need a clear national framework that outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Government in the areas of social protection, health, education, housing and justice.  This should include guidance and standards, monitoring frameworks and audit procedures.  I recognise this is not something we had ever envisaged would be required.  I imagine that coming out of Covid people were quite hopeful for time to get working on the Departments' normal work.  Unfortunately this crisis has happened.  A clear framework is absolutely required.<\/p> <p> There is a need for adherence to international standards for humanitarian responses, in particular adherence to the international agreed minimum standards for child protection in emergencies and the minimum standards for education in emergencies.  We need a strategy to engage and co-ordinate between national and local levels and the non-governmental sector.  Communication and guidance are fundamental to a successful local response in this regard.  I get the sense from listening to the Ministers who have spoken in the debate that a huge amount is happening in each Department.  In some instances it is happening in silos.  It is not being communicated to a local level.  The communication gaps need to be addressed.<\/p> <p> There needs to be a clear plan to ensure services provided to refugees by the philanthropic community, churches, NGOs and individuals are subject to minimum standards to ensure child protection, data management and co-ordination with national systems.  We are moving to Government services being accountable for upholding and protecting the rights it has guaranteed to Ukrainian refugees.  We are in an emergency phase of the situation but this is where we need to go and I hope the Government can get the structures in place quickly.  It is not just about the national structure; it is also about the local structures.<\/p> <p> I welcome that community response teams are being put into each local authority.  They were very successful during Covid.  The communities responded well to them.  The framework is in place and I hope it can be reactivated very quickly.  There needs to be a standard or an overview of what is happening.  I understand some authorities have re-established them and others have not.  There is still a lack of clarity on what their functions are, how they will be rolled out and when they will be rolled out.  I understand the Department will house a number of refugees in large accommodation centres.  The provision of services to these people will be easier.  It will be harder to target and assist those going into family homes.  There needs to be consideration of how we can create linkages for people living with individuals throughout the country.<\/p> <p> Something that has been made clear is that the requirements being placed on large provision centres seem to be primarily with regard to the provision of a bed and food.  We should expand this and look beyond the bare essentials.  How will people wash their clothes?  How will they provide school lunches?  Are there kitchen facilities?  Is there a room in which the refugees can gather?  Is there a social room where they can mingle or get English lessons?  These are the types of services we should require of the accommodation providers if possible.  Another issue raised with me is that hotels are providing very standard three meals a day.  A baby might need non-solid foods and they do not eat according to our timeframes.  These issues will be ironed out as we go along but I would like the Minister to be mindful of them when engaging with accommodation providers.<\/p> <p> Education will be a key component of providing stability and support not only to the children and students coming in but to their mothers also.  Knowing their children are happy in school will bring huge comfort to parents.  Many schools have gone above and beyond to take in students to their classrooms and to their hearts.  There needs to be guidance from the Department on enrolment policies.  At present schools cannot go outside their enrolment policies to take in individuals.  The Minister needs to give clear guidance that we are in an emergency situation and there should be provision to override schools' enrolment policy to enable them to take in students.  It is not just a matter of finding a place for a student.  Schools do not have English language supports.  They do not have mental health supports.  Ongoing resourcing will need to be provided.<\/p> <p> I have spoken to the Minister previously with regard to health.  It is critical that refugees coming in have access to GP care within the first 24 hours of arriving at a centre.  Dehydration and a lack of prescription medication are proving very difficult for people.  I have a huge amount more to say but I have run out of time.  This is an issue on which we will have to work together and I hope we can do so.  We also need to work quickly on it.  I will keep in touch with the Minister on other aspects that come to light.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000036#OO00400","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648648020,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach and the Ministers for their intervention.

There is much need for a discussion not only this afternoon but on a continuous basis as this war continues to rage on.  The refugee crisis stemming from it will not end quickly.  We are seeing the largest displacement of people on the Continent since the Second World War.<\/p>  <p>  I want to touch on a number of areas.  Many of them have been raised by other speakers and will be raised during the course of the debate.  This is a debate worth having on a regular basis.  We need to see a clarity of updates not only to the House but to Opposition leaders and wider society as a whole.  We have all been touched by the generosity of Irish people, be it in terms of raising funds for the Red Cross, offering to open up their homes, give up their holiday homes and whatever they can.  I have been taken by the number of schools and others in my community that have held fundraisers and events.  There are also those who have protested against this bloody war at the gates of this House or outside the embassy.  There remain quite a number of questions and there is a desire for people who want to help to have clarity on this help.  Those offering accommodation are asking questions that on the face of it may seem cold but it does have long-term implications.<\/p> <p>They are asking when they might expect to receive the property back, whether they can inspect it to ensure it is maintained and that the bills are paid.  They are not asking in any callous manner, but out of a duty of care to those they are opening up their properties to.<\/p> <p> My second point is one I have raised before and relates to something I am deeply concerned about, the strategy for dealing with the pastoral requirements of the people who are coming to our country as guests.  We can talk about practical needs in respect of accommodation, healthcare, school places and linguistic supports, including the clear need to train people to give them a basic level of Ukrainian and to provide access to English language courses, but I am very aware that the vast majority coming to Ireland having fled Ukraine will be in a state of trauma.  In many cases, they are seeing their homes absolutely levelled.  They have left behind family members who are perhaps too infirm to travel or who have taken up the cause and are fighting to defend their homeland.  Over the course of the next couple of months, and possibly years, they will be receiving extremely difficult news and will be left in the dark with regard to other news.  We have an absolute responsibility to ensure that pastoral counselling and linguistic support is available.<\/p> <p> I attended an event in my own community on Sunday in the parish centre in Kilternan where a number of Ukrainians who had just arrived in the country were met by local people who just wanted to be there for them and to provide a basic introduction to our communities, rather than just our country, and not just on a short-term basis.  However, there is always a need for co-ordination at the level of the Government and officialdom to ensure it is done in a proper, right and consistent manner.  I will conclude on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000037#PP00200","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648648620,"counter":275,"content":"<p>How beautifully true c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte romhat rings from an Irish perspective at the moment.  The arms of Ireland are wide open to welcome refugees coming from Ukraine.  As of yesterday, my county of Clare had 1,500 Ukrainian refugees.  I believe that figure will rise to 1,800 tonight.  That is the largest intake of any Irish county.  It must be said that it is a rural county and that its capacity to do this is very much under strain but the arms are still wide open and people are very welcome.  Like other speakers, I acknowledge the immense efforts of volunteers throughout County Clare who are doing everything from gathering food and collecting shoes to running coffee mornings and helping to ferry kids to school.  Their efforts are absolutely immense.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister and his officials for what they are trying to do.  This is a crisis situation.  Europe is at war and Ireland is playing its part as a neutral nation in welcoming people to safe refuge but I am very concerned about how some of this is unfolding and manifesting itself on the ground.  A town and a community can only properly support and offer care, shelter and all of the ancillary supports people require when it has the capacity to do so.  The town of Lisdoonvarna in County Clare ordinarily has a population of 300 people.  It does not have great GP capacity or immense public transport infrastructure.  The schools are small.  That community struggles to meet the needs of its surrounding hinterland in ordinary times.  At the moment, 850 refugees are staying in the town.  The town is very welcoming and warm but it is struggling.  It has gone beyond its capacity in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Again, Lisdoonvarna has a population of 300 people and has taken in 850 refugees.  Down the road, Limerick city has a population of 60,000 to 70,000 but there are fewer than 100 refugees in Limerick city.  Not every town, village and city is carrying its share of the load and playing its part.  More places in Ireland, more towns and villages in Clare and more counties in Ireland need to step up to the plate because, at the moment, refugees are being funnelled into communities that are bursting at the seams and the needs of those refugees are not being fully met.  Yesterday morning, a Bus &Eacute;ireann service from Lisdoonvarna to Doolin National School never arrived.  There is no GP capacity.<\/p>  <p>  I will ask for a number of things in my concluding moments.  The Minister needs to sanction translators.  In schools we have English as an additional language, EAL, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, principals and teachers but a translator is absolutely essential from a pastoral, home-school link point of view.  We also need a GP service.  We have fully trained, fully competent Ukrainian doctors with the full language skill set required in refugee centres.  They need to be appointed to do the circuit around all of the accommodation centres to meet people's medical needs because our existing GP service is not sufficient.  The point I am trying to make is that we are wide open and welcoming but you cannot funnel hundreds and hundreds of people into an area without providing all of the ancillary supports needed.  These are lacking in Clare.  Tonight, 1% of the population of Clare will be Ukrainian.  Do we have the capacity to help them?  We do, to a point, but we have gone beyond that point.  More Clare communities need to step up but so does the rest of Ireland.  Ancillary supports are crucial to making this a success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000038#QQ00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1648648620,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will begin by referencing the Taoiseach's opening remarks, which addressed the wider global context.  In the face of the humanitarian tragedy playing out in front of us, there is a need in both the short term and longer term to have a look at the global systems that underpin much of this conflict, including with regard to energy security and our reliance on fossil fuels, which needs to be rethought and unpicked for a range of reasons.  We also need to consider downstream products, even with regard to the production of fertiliser and how we have built our agricultural system around that kind of fossil fuel input.  We will also need a short-term or medium-term response to hunger in the global south.  This is something I have raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.  We will need a response to global food security because we know that Ukraine and Russia make a disproportionate contribution to the global grain supply.  That will have to be addressed before the next harvest.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the national context, the first thing we need to get across is the scale of the challenge we are facing.  The Minister was very clear on this.  This challenge is unprecedented in nature and we need to face up to that in our conversations.  We almost need to revert to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  The first thing we need to do is to provide these people with accommodation and shelter and to make sure they arrive at safe harbour.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the incredible outpouring of support through the Red Cross's pledging system but we need a one-day, one-week, one-month and one-year plan.  A lot of what Deputy Whitmore said chimed with my own understanding of the issue.  We absolutely need an emergency response now but we also need longer-term planning.  We need such planning with regard to how we layer needs.  I believe Deputy Cathal Crowe was moving towards this in his contribution.  We need to think about where accommodation and school places are available but also about where transport and social welfare services are available and, it is to be hoped, where employment will be available.<\/p>  <p>  I only have a few seconds remaining but, on the education response, we need to have a conversation about how to best provide for the educational needs of the children who are arriving and what is needed to address their trauma.  We should begin a conversation on some sort of summer provision to allow them to get to grips with some of the language difficulties.  There is a great raft of things we need to get across but the number one thing is the scale of the problem we are facing.

The response under both headings has been very good.  It has been compassionate and accurate.  On the political response, the Government is to be commended for having identified unambiguously where fault for this war lies.  It unambiguously lies with the expansionist and imperialist policies of Vladimir Putin's regime.  It does not rest with any desire for expansion on the part of the EU, with NATO expansionism or with expansionism on the part of the United States.  It unambiguously lies with Vladimir Putin's regime.  The Government has been very clear in emphasising that and I commend it on doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also been clear in identifying the solution.  The only solution to this is the removal of Putin's forces from independent Ukraine.  We have to be clear and reassert that unambiguously.  It can sometimes be difficult for a neutral State to be listened to when talking about an armed conflict but let that not silence us because we come with a strong voice in the world and we should unambiguously repeat the fact that Putin needs to remove his forces from independent Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at the humanitarian response of the Government to date, which has been commendable.  That response reflects the view and charity of the Irish people.  To date, we have accepted 15,000 Ukrainian refugees.  As the Minister has indicated, that number is going to rise.  We also need to be clear and honest with Irish people that, once the offers of accommodation have been exhausted, it will become increasingly difficult for the State to provide that level of accommodation.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>We still find ourselves in situations where emergency accommodation is being provided in places that we would not regard as suitable.  We need to be honest with the public about the challenges we face.<\/p> <p> When looking at the overall response, we need to have a general recognition and respect for democracy.  Democracy is in its infancy throughout the world.  In the history of the world, democracy has only existed in countries for 100 years or so.  Let us consider what the poor Russian people have gone through for the past 400 years.  They had 300 years of the Romanov tsars.  They then managed to get rid of them and they were replaced by the tyrannical Marxist-Leninist regime that ruined the lives of people and deprived them of human rights for 80 years.  After that they have been subjected to Vladimir Putin.  I suspect the real fear that Vladimir Putin has is not the arrival of missiles in neighbouring countries, but the arrival of democracy into those countries, particularly democracy as epitomised by the European Union.  I wish democracy to the Russian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000038#QQ00400","speaker":"1553","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648649220,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Until very recently, Ukrainians lived normal lives, but that changed abruptly when Russia invaded.  Ukrainians are also experiencing agonising feelings of injustice and unfairness as their hard-earned democracy and freedom have been ripped away.  The people arriving on our shores have had their whole lives turned upside down.  People have had to leave behind their homes, their jobs, their schools, their friends and basically everything they know.  Most heartbreaking of all is the separation of families - fathers and brothers who had to remain in Ukraine to fight against the Russian invasion and elderly relations who may not have wanted to or were unable to make the uncertain journey.  These people are leaving a war-torn situation.  This is an especially traumatic experience for anyone to endure.<\/p>  <p>  Abundant research shows that such difficult experiences can lead to severe consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.  PTSD symptoms include terrifying and realistic flashbacks of war scenes, intrusive memories of the trauma, panic, inability to sleep and nightmares as well as avoidance of anything that resembles any sort of trauma.  Children are specifically vulnerable.  We can only imagine the terror children face in a dark basement watching the faces of their parents, praying that the next missile will not hit their building.  Parents can shield their children to some extent from this trauma but they can only do so much.<\/p>  <p>  When people arrive in this State, we can very quickly identify physical health needs, but identifying the psychological needs is not so straightforward.  Trauma does not always manifest itself immediately but can come to the fore months and sometimes even years after traumatic events that people have had to endure.  It is incumbent on the Government to plan for the dramatic effects of war and displacement.  The Government must plan to provide mental health services in a culturally appropriate manner and to consider language and other factors.  We do not know how long these people will be here.  Looking at the structural damage to their homeland, many may not get the opportunity to return home.

I received an email from one of my constituents yesterday highlighting the work of a support group, Helping Ukrainians in Ireland.  He pointed to the information and representation gap on the border between Poland and Ukraine as well as a dire lack of transport.  One of the people involved in the initiative is called Joby Redmond and he posted the following:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am back in ... [Poland] on Saturday.  I need a translator and I need help with the organising of getting families to Ireland.  I have been trying to do this on my own with my own funds, but I need the physical help now because it&rsquo;s got very busy and these people want to leave fast.  I have got 30 families out in 1 week and that&rsquo;s nearly 100 people.  I'm getting help with buses from Germany, France and UK organisations.  There are no Irish organisations helping at the border except for amazing Irish people who have come down to volunteer. <\/blockquote>  <p>He is working on his own initiative, using his own funds.  He has expressed real concern about human trafficking risks if no clear transport is organised.  Time and again we have seen how refugees, who are trying to flee war, famine and distress in their own countries, can be abused by people who are seeking to exploit them.  I ask the Government to contact this person to see if it can do anything to support him to get people here safely without being exploited by people who are traffickers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000039#RR00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1648649220,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Boyd Barrett and Barry.<\/p>  <p>  I will mainly focus my remarks on the question of giving the best welcome to those who are fleeing from Ukraine and coming to Ireland.  Before I get to that, I want to make a couple of international points.  Does the Irish Government have a position on the call from large trade unions in Ukraine and social movements for the cancellation of Ukraine's odious debt?  It is immense; the foreign debt stands at $125 billion.  The debt servicing expenditure is 12% of all the state's budgetary expenditure.  In the appeal, they make the point that chaotic borrowing and antisocial debt conditionality was a result of total oligarchisation.  Unwilling to fight the wealthy, the state rulers kept getting deeper in debt.  Loans were issued under conditions of social spending cuts and the repayment forced it to economise on vital needs and apply austerity to foundational economic sectors.   Ukraine is a very poor country.  Debt servicing is contrary to rebuilding that state in any just way.  The Government should make a clear statement calling for the cancellation of Ukrainian debt.  That would be a real act of solidarity.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Government to make a statement about, or a criticism of, the so-called temporary suspension of 11 opposition parties in Ukraine.  It is very concerning.  While we would not share anything in common with these political parties, between them they got 18.3% of the vote in the previous election.  It includes the biggest opposition party, which got 2.7 million votes.  Of course, it is very likely that what starts out as a temporary measure becomes a permanent ban.  We have seen that repeatedly with anti-democratic measures introduced at times of emergency.<\/p>  <p>  I quote from the head of the Ukrainian socialist organisation, the Social Movement.  Again, this group does not politically stand in solidarity with these parties that have been banned.  It makes the point that the Ukrainian Government telling several million Ukrainians that the parties they voted for are beyond the pale is unlikely to motivate them to keep fighting the invaders at the front either.  It undermines the struggle against the Russian invasion to send such a message and we need a statement by the Irish Government opposing this undemocratic measure.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to step up and provide the funding for schools so that they can welcome the new intake of Ukrainian children who have had to flee war.  We need to hire new teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.  We should start by offering proper full-time contracts for those teachers currently looking week to week for substitute teaching hours.  We need extra counselling support, including psychologists, available to help children recovering from the traumas of war.  There are many empty buildings near our schools, particularly church-owned buildings, which should immediately be brought into public ownership and used to expand facilities.  These people need support.<\/p>  <p>  My final point is about English language teachers, many of whom are currently very poorly paid and on precarious contracts in the private sector.<\/p> <p>Instead of relying on these private companies, we need to expand the ETB English language teaching programme and provide classes right across the country, free of charge and with staff properly paid and on decent contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000039#RR00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648649820,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The world is rightly disgusted at Putin&rsquo;s bloody invasion of Ukraine and it is right and proper that we should be as generous as possible in our solidarity with the Ukrainian people fleeing Putin's bloody war.  I want to commend groups like the Red Cross and the many individuals who have offered accommodation, many of whom have gone out to offer transport and other assistance in the Ukraine to help Ukrainian people exit this disastrous war instigated by Putin.<\/p>  <p>  We have a huge task in terms of accommodating the people who are coming in but, frankly, this should be the moment when we take the sort of radical measures we should have taken long ago to address the housing emergency in this country.  One of the things we learned during Covid, and we may learn it again, is that when the Government actually wants to have an emergency response, it is capable of doing so.  It is absolutely right that we should have an emergency response to the disaster in Ukraine.  However, in the St. Helen's Court complex, where people have been threatened with eviction by a vulture fund and where, sitting alongside the place people are being evicted from, there have been for the past two years 15 empty apartments that the vulture fund has just sat on, which should have been used to house people, someone said to me: &ldquo;Maybe, finally, the Government will build some houses for us.&rdquo;  In other words, they were not in any way hostile to Ukrainians coming in and they absolutely recognise the need to be generous, but they simultaneously ask if this means we actually could have the wherewithal to make homelessness a thing of the past and take the sort of radical measures to get hold of empty properties being sat on by speculators, land hoarders and so on to house everybody.  We should have done it long before now and this should be the moment when we do it.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing I want to comment on is this.  If we are rightly opening the door and our hearts to people fleeing from Ukraine, it has also essentially revealed a double standard in terms of providing refuge to people fleeing war.  We learn, with Ukraine, why people flee their homes.  It is because of war and, immediately, we recognise they do not want to leave home but they need assistance.  Was that any less true in Afghanistan, except it was a US-led war?  Maybe that is why we had a different attitude.  Was that any less true in Syria, which was a Russian-led war?  We were different in terms of our treatment of Syrians.  Do we show the same generosity for people fleeing Somalia, which the US bombed in the past few weeks?  There is a different standard.  Those double standards will come back to haunt us.  Those double standards are apparent in our different responses to the politics of Putin&rsquo;s imperialist invasion.  It is an imperialist invasion but so was the US-UK-led war on Iraq.  What is the support for Israel, which Amnesty is now rightly condemning as guilty of crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people?  We do not impose the same sanctions on them, we do not criticise them in the same way and we certainly do not offer the same level of solidarity to the Palestinian people.  Is this going to be the moment when double standards are abandoned and we oppose all warmongering in the same way and show solidarity to all people fleeing war, regardless of their colour or creed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000040#SS00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1648649820,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I have consistently made the point in this House that the two key factors in defeating the invasion will be, first, the resistance of the Ukrainian people and, second, the Russian anti-war movement.  Today, I want to go into a small bit more detail on the question of that resistance.  When James Connolly addressed members of the Irish Citizen Army at Liberty Hall in 1916 before marching to the GPO, he told them, in the event of victory, to hold onto their guns.  He said that the people we are fighting alongside are out for political liberty but that we are out for social and economic liberty as well.  I hope the Ukrainian people drive out the Russian invaders and I hope, when that is done, that the working people of Ukraine - a clear majority of the population - move to take control of their country, take control of its wealth and take control of its mineral and agricultural resources.  In other words, I hope they achieve not just political liberty, but economic and social liberty as well.<\/p>  <p>  This is an important point because there will be other forces interested in that wealth and those mineral resources and agricultural resources too.  Obviously, Putin is one but there are also false friends of Ukraine in governments in Washington and London and in European Union capitals who front for big corporations - the oligarchs of the West, if we like - who would like a friendly government in Kyiv and easy and profitable access to those resources.  Some of those governments are offering military hardware to the Ukrainian Government.  No doubt people in Ukraine will take guns from wherever they can at the moment, but I would be very wary of the unofficial price tags that are being attached.  All the more reason, in my view, that Ukrainian workers need to organise, and organise independently.  The words of James Connolly in this city more than 100 years ago also have relevance for them there today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000040#SS00300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1648649820,"counter":285,"content":"<p>This is a very important debate and I think we all agree on the necessity to have this debate.

On every television, on every Facebook page, on every TikTok channel, the reality that war is evil and the human tragedies are unfolding hourly on the media.

Indeed, Ukraine was described by Ukrainian writer, Vasily Grossman, during the Second World War as his country was reduced to &ldquo;fire and tears&rdquo; and &ldquo;sadness and wrath&rdquo;.  He said, in a very powerful book which he wrote, <i>Life and Fate<\/i>, &ldquo;There is power, which can resurrect huge cities from the ashes, but no power in the world is capable of lifting the light eyelashes over the eyes of a dead child.&rdquo;  We need to learn from our history.  There was a man who wrote of the Nazi occupation of the Ukraine, and of Russia as well at the time, and pointed out clearly what happens when evil takes over and when good is banished.<\/p><p>The Irish actions, particularly in regard to the United Nations, are very powerful and very important.  Notwithstanding other voices in this House, the fact is that our role in the United Nations, our role in the world, always has been one of peacekeeping and of trying to find solutions.  I commend our ambassador at the United Nations, who just happens to be from Drogheda, so I have to praise her.  We are doing an excellent job there, in addition to the leadership we are showing as a medium size country in Europe in regard to how we respond to this appalling invasion.  As I and other Members have said, all of our communities, through &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; to the children collecting funds on the corner, are reaching out to help and support and open our doors to these people.<\/p><p>The important thing we need to plan now is how we make sure we are in a position, in our own country, to defend our borders if and when they may be threatened by sea, on land or in our airspace.  The recent report on our defence capacity into the future is very important and we need to debate that fully.  I understand we will have the Government decision on it shortly.  We must be able to defend our land and, unfortunately, as a result of what is happening in the Ukraine, we must invest more in our military capacity to defeat any invaders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000040#SS00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1648649820,"counter":286,"content":"<p>At the international level, the Government has moved fast and has taken a leadership role.<\/p> <p>I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister and their Cabinet colleagues on stepping up to the challenge.  <\/p> <p> Going back to the first moments of Putin's aggression against Ukraine, Ireland was clear about its responsibilities, understood its influence and urged a strong and united international response.  As bad as the situation in Ukraine is, that leadership from Ireland and other member states has helped Ukraine in its efforts to resist Putin's aggression.  The alternative to that response was to step aside, keep our hands clean and let his army role across the border and into Kyiv.  While we struggled with the question of supplying military hardware - our neutrality and position of constructive abstention is something about which we will have to have a national debate - we did in those initial days and weeks everything we could, sincerely and diligently.<\/p> <p> This challenge is only beginning.  I spoke already in this House of my experience of being on the ferry from France with hundreds of Ukrainian refugees a few weeks ago.  Despite taking a keen interest in all aspects of this crisis, it was not until I was on that ferry with those people and witnessed their tears and sadness that I felt I understand the enormity of what was unfolding.  <\/p> <p> We have responded speedily and effectively, in great contrast to our near neighbours.  We have put no limit on the number of refugees who will come to our country.  This decision will be no small part of an Taoiseach's legacy.  When asked on British television whether he has security concerns about letting in refugees, he answered: \"The humanitarian response trumps anything as far as we're concerned.\"  That answer is a succinct expression of Ireland's approach and one of which the Taoiseach and Ireland should be proud. <\/p> <p> My colleagues across the House have outlined many of the emerging issues.  The pressures on housing, education, the social welfare system and the health system have been well articulated.  Organisations on the front line of the effort are working tirelessly to ensure refugees arriving here are looked after for their immediate needs.  I pay tribute to the Irish Red Cross, which is doing stellar work at the points of entry.  In my constituency, the Minister will be well aware of the work of Doras Luimn&iacute;.  For many years that organisation has been at the coalface of efforts to integrate refugees into our community.  The scale of this wave of refugees is so large that it and other organisations like it will be stretched to the limit.  I urge the Minister to look at this and seek to provide resources so such organisations can carry out their vital work.  Resources allocated in their direction now will be well spent, prevent further cost to the State down the line and give Ukrainian refugees the best chance of settling into Ireland.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000040#SS00500","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648650420,"counter":288,"content":"<p>It is impossible for us to fully understand the loss, grief, courage and defiance of the Ukrainian people.  We can only stand in solidarity and stretch out the hand of friendship.  It is a tribute to the Irish people that, up and down the country, that is being done.  The stresses that is creating have been highlighted but the Government has responded quickly and with compassion to the challenges we face.<\/p>  <p>  It is said that in war the first casualty is truth and there is no doubt that in the case of Russia that is so.  Russia breached the Budapest memorandum which set out six obligations designed to protect the independent sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine.  Russia wantonly tore up that agreement by its invasion of Crimea.  That invasion initiated Ukraine's interest in joining NATO.  That had not been a commitment of Ukraine before that.  The Russian action has humiliated many people in Europe who tried to hold out a hand of friendship and d&eacute;tente over many years.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulties Russia faces are of its own making.  However, we must find a way to talk to the Russian people about the challenges they now face.  They are sending their young to die in a cause which is a vanity project for the ebbing career of an autocrat.  Do they know the actions of their troops have forced half the children of Ukraine to abandon their homes?  It is an extraordinary figure, barely equalled in countries like France during the Second World War.  Do they know the toll of the war crimes being done in the name of the Russian people and for which there will be an account to be held?  Sanctions are right but, in the long term, isolation of Russian people is not a sustainable answer.  We must find a way to talk over the heads of the ambassadors and the Russian security system to ordinary Russians about the challenges the action of their leadership has created.<\/p>  <p>  The free world has responded with much greater solidarity than anyone expected and it is to the credit of those involved.  The world has been changed by this aggressive action and we need to look at the international organisations of which we are members to see whether they can respond more effectively.  We must stop war crime tribunals and trials only being for those who are defeated.  That has been, sadly, the pattern in the past.  We must seek to find security guarantees that can stick for the Ukrainian people when these issues are finally resolved.  We must find a way to move on from the UN's arrangements whereby the veto of one party can stop any effective action.  We must insist on such a UN resolution before we become involved in any peacekeeping or peacemaking activity.  The biggest test for us is sustaining our focus after the attention of the world's media has moved on.  We need to sustain it because the world has decisively shifted to become a more dangerous place and we need as international politicians to respond to that greater danger.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000041#TT00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1648650420,"counter":289,"content":"<p>T&eacute;imid ar ais go dt&iacute; an p&aacute;irt&iacute; Shinn F&eacute;in, an Teachta Martin Browne agus an Teachta Andrews.

At the risk of repeating myself, I have to say that a peaceful resolution to all conflicts must be our main focus.  The scenes we are witnessing can easily make us question everything, but a resolution that involves the withdrawal of Russia must be the main objective.  The scenes we have witnessed were unthinkable for the 21st century, but here we are, faced with a tyrannical regime that is hell-bent on imposing an agenda that seeks to impose its dominance.  It cares little for the people it displaces, the families it tears apart and the savagery it imposes.  That is why we must play our part.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has not fallen short when it comes to helping people seeking refuge from the horrors being inflicted upon them by the Russian Government.  The response of the Irish people has been extraordinary.  Every community across this country will see similar levels of openness and compassion to those I have seen in County Tipperary, with people registering to open their homes to refugees while communities such as Fethard are coming up with initiatives to refurbish buildings to house larger numbers of refugees.  The Presentation Convent building in Fethard is one example.  This is Ireland at its best.  This is a country that knows the impact of aggression and how to respond in a manner that has peace and security at heart.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the decision to lift visa requirements between Ukraine and Ireland to facilitate the entry of people to this country and to ease their situation as they settle into a foreign country while their own remains under constant attack.  A couple of issues have been brought to my attention.  They have to do with the systems that are being put in place to help integrate refugees, particularly in the areas of education and accommodation.  I have been told that the provision of translation services for schools is not meeting the increased demand.  There is uncertainty as to whether the Department intends to allocate additional funding to schools to provide for the demand that is being placed upon them or if it will come from the schools' budgets.  Can the Ministers in question provide some clarity on this?<\/p>  <p>  I also have questions about the co-ordinated response to accommodation.  Are there plans for regional databases of houses available or households willing to take in refugees?   This is a question that is being asked by a group involved in the refugee programme in the south east.  I have been informed that there are schools in the south east making enquiries about accommodation for children who are in emergency accommodation presenting at schools.  This is an undue burden for these schools to take upon themselves, but I understand that is the situation in which some find themselves.  Has a database been put together that can match need with availability on an area-by-area or region-by-region basis and that can be accessed by people working to process and allocate resources to refugees?  I would appreciate any clarity that I can get on these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000041#TT00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1648650420,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the situation in Ukraine.  I send my continued solidarity to the people of Ukraine.  The resilience and courage they have shown is inspiring.  Every day they are enduring the brutal and deadly reality of Russian aggression.<\/p> <p>It has been uplifting to see the rapid response, from here and from the rest of Europe, and the opening of doors to give shelter and support to those fleeing this war of aggression.  A notable player in this regard has been the Red Cross.  It has been doing amazing work and it is important to acknowledge that.<br\/><br\/>Rarely have we seen sporting organisations take a stand in wars.  This has changed in the context of Ukraine and Russia, but this change must be applied equally.  We saw the decisive pressure applied to Roman Abramovich that pushed him to begin the process of selling Chelsea Football Club.  We have also seen powerful acts of solidarity with Ukraine by sports fans in stands right across the world.  What worries me now is the lack of continuity from the sporting community.  It feels selective in what wars it opposes.  Newcastle United Football Club is now effectively owned by the Saudi Arabian government.  Last Sunday, the second round of the Formula One championship was hosted there.  This is the Saudis whitewashing their terror.  Saudi Arabia is waging a brutal and illegal war on the people of Yemen, where nearly 400,000 women, children and men have died.  Only last year, an Algerian athlete, Fethi Nourine, and his coach were banned from competing for ten years for refusing to compete against an athlete from apartheid Israel.  How can anyone justify that ten-year ban?  Drug cheats in sports have got significantly shorter bans of a few months or years.  Where is the consistency?<br\/><br\/>It seems that the world's sporting federations view some wars as brutal and oppressive and others as none of their business.  Waving a Palestinian flag at a UEFA match will result in a club being fined, but it is okay, rightly, for fans to wave a Ukrainian flag.  This is the sort of inconsistency our international sports bodies need to address.  Sporting bodies have played an important role in standing up to the Russian aggression, but we cannot have an <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>approach to wars.  We cannot have one terror state being allowed to sportswash while another faces sanctions.  We must put an end to sportswashing by all terror states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000041#TT00500","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648651020,"counter":293,"content":"<p>It is hard to find words to describe the horror of the war in Ukraine.  Undoubtedly, this shocking invasion has led to a strong desire among Irish people to help in any way we can.  Ukraine and Ireland share many parallels between their histories.  Ukraine is lodged right up against a large colonial power, has suffered from extensive and devastating famines because of the decisions of that colonial power and aggressive wars were also waged against the smaller country by that colonial power.  Undoubtedly, we cannot afford to stand idly by.  We should be as active as we can be in respect of offering support, in a humanitarian sense, and also agitating for peace and de-escalation.<\/p>  <p>  I find it hard, however, to find evidence of this Government agitating or working for de-escalation.  In the last several months especially, it seems the Government has outsourced much of our foreign affairs activities to the EU.  When Aont&uacute; pushed for the Government to expel the Russian ambassador, the response was that it would wait for the rest of Europe to do so also.  The Government said the action would have more power if the EU as a whole acted.  It may be true that a collective decision would have more impact and influence.  Collective indecision, however, does not have any more power or influence.  In fact, we could show leadership in making these decisions ourselves.  It seems shocking that we would outsource our sovereignty on these key issues, supposedly to help the sovereignty of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for us to have a leadership role in respect of the decisions we take to help Ukraine in its time of need.  I look at countries such as Israel and France in this regard.  Their leaders picked up the phone and made an effort to talk to the leadership in Russia about de-escalation.  Many would say it is hardly likely that people will listen to Ireland in this situation.  On the flip side, though, it is hardly likely that 100 rockets being sent over from the Curragh to Ukraine is going to change the nature of the war there, yet we have seen many people from the Government benches argue that Ireland should start to feed lethal weapons into that war.<\/p>  <p>  That would be a grave mistake.  Ireland has a strong and proud history of neutrality.  It has a proud history as well in respect of UN peacekeeping, of anti-colonialism, of fighting against nuclear weapons and of missionary work.  We saw missionaries leave this country for generations to go to the developing world to help to build that developing world.  As a result of that strong work, we have a great reputation internationally.  An Irish passport opens minds and doors everywhere we go.  We have a competency, if you like, in being a country that can be seen to help to de-escalate situations and to be able to send people in to sit down and try to work with different factions to see if we can bring about peace.  Our own peace process gives us expertise in that space as well.<\/p>  <p>  If we were to get involved in aligning ourselves with military blocs, we would undoubtedly squander our reputation, competitive advantage and competency in this regard.  People who have studied neutrality and military blocs will tell us that those blocs have often used wars to look after their own economic needs.  We have, indeed, seen NATO being involved in military conflicts as a result, primarily, of its own economic needs.  Small countries have little influence in respect of directing the actions of large military blocs.  It is absolutely illogical therefore to think that Ireland would have influence over any military bloc, be it the EU or NATO, in respect of how it uses its military.  Yet we would have to supply military hardware and, potentially, young men and women to fight in those wars.<\/p>  <p>  An interesting example of our influence, compared to that of Germany, was that the EU decided to take the step towards providing military hardware to Ukraine based simply on the fact that Germany decided to change its policy in this regard.  As soon as Germany changed its policy, the policy changed throughout the EU.  Therefore, we must ensure that we focus on humanitarian aid.  We can do a great deal in this respect.  We have not exhausted our ability to help, and the need for that help, in any way whatsoever.  We are only touching the tip of the iceberg in this respect.  We can save lives through the provision of medical supplies to people in Ukraine.  They need blood, oxygen, medicines, warm clothing, tents and sleeping bags and other materials of this type and we can provide far more in that context.<\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the role played by people like Laura O'Neill, a representative of Aont&uacute; in Westmeath, in respect of gathering an enormous amount of material to send over to Poland to help people in Ukraine.  I also commend Elaine Dunne from the Federation of Early Childhood Providers, FECP, who is on her way to Poland with a truck full of medical and humanitarian material.  This is the real impact people here can have in helping our brothers and sisters in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the issue of refugees, I note that the Taoiseach and other leaders of the Government appeared on international media making highbrow speeches in the context of welcoming refugees to Ireland.  I also note, however, that at the time I was getting phone calls from social welfare offices telling me they were dealing with people coming here from Ukraine but did not know what to do with them.  I was getting phone calls from the offices of GPs to say they had people from Ukraine arriving but that they had got no direction from the Government about how to deal with those people.  A young Ukrainian woman also rang me from Limerick.  She had flown in, met with her friends in Dublin Airport, and then did not know where to go in respect of securing housing when she was in Limerick.  People like those working in the Red Cross have done great work in helping refugees.<\/p>  <p>  My key point, and I would like the Minister to pay particular attention to it, is that there must be an interdepartmental task force to deal with refugees coming into the State.  For ten years, this State has welcomed approximately 4,500 refugees annually.  In the last four weeks, though, it has welcomed about 15,000 refugees.  Therefore, there is a need for centralised, interdepartmental co-operation to ensure that all key stakeholders are involved and good communication about what is happening.<\/p> <p>Right around the country, I can think of church leaders, parish priests, community groups and civil society groups doing phenomenal work.  I understand from speaking to these groups that the Government is yet to engage with them, and that is not right.  The Government should do the media briefings and appearances but its members should do the background work first and get the key elements sorted.<\/p> <p> We are hearing stories about sex for rent and I am delighted such practices are being addressed by a Bill in the D&aacute;il.  We must ensure there is absolutely no space for exploitation in any way here and there can be accountability right through society about what is happening.  I have a fear that we will see Ukrainians being sent to direct provision centres at some stage in this process.  We already know that in my county at Gormanstown, the Army is looking at using tents to deal with the refugee crisis.  I would like to see more effort being made to get vacant homes right across the State back into use for housing refugees coming here.  There are many old schools, convents and buildings in this country and I know some in my constituency that are in the hands of the church or the State that have been empty for long periods.  We need to get those buildings back into use to ensure we can accommodate refugees.  Many of the steps necessary to house the many people already searching for homes in this country are the same as those needed to house refugees.  Work done in this respect would help with both of these problems.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to the group MECPATHS for the fantastic work it has done in combating human trafficking.  It has called for all front-line staff to be trained in identifying the exploitation of women and children in the context of a refugee crisis.  Will the Government ensure this happens?  Human trafficking is something that does not get adequate discussion or debate in this House and I commend JP, Ann and all those at MECPATHS for the constant campaigning they do on this issue.  It is absolutely appalling that this State is an outlier in the lack of work it does to protect people who are trafficked.  It is something we do not see and it is hidden for many people in society but it is absolutely real for hundreds of people on an annual basis in this State.<\/p> <p> I will briefly speak about the amount of money washing around in the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  It is incredible that there are billions of Russian roubles washing around the IFSC, with people trying to circumvent the sanctions that have been placed on Russia by the West.  The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland was before a finance committee here a few minutes ago.  I do not want to put words in his mouth but I can paraphrase him.  He believes there are up to 15 or 16 entities in the IFSC with connections with sanctioned individuals or entities in Russia.  I have asked the Government numerous times if it will investigate what is happening.  I have also asked the Central Bank if it is investigating what is happening.  It has indicated, being honest, that its role is administrative and it does not have a proactive role in the process.  I have called the Garda economic bureau and asked what it is doing to investigate but I have received no answer.  What is the Government doing to investigate the billions of euro or Russian roubles washing around the IFSC?<\/p> <p> At the same time there are Government parties here looking to sanction Poland.  Instead of ensuring sanctions are enforced against Russia in this country, they are seeking sanctions for the country that has taken the most refugees during this crisis.  Poland has taken over 2 million refugees and none of them is being put into a camp; I understand all of them are being taken into homes.  That comes at a massive cost to Poland.  I give credit to the Polish people and the Polish ambassador for the work Poland has done.  Nevertheless, there are political parties in this House and the European Union that seek to enforce sanctions against Poland at this time.  I ask those parties to desist from such actions and ensure Poland can have the necessary funding to deal with the refugee crisis there.<\/p> <p> It is very important we see actions rather than words in helping refugees and providing accommodation.  We must ensure the proper action is taken with the sanctions against Russia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000042#UU00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648651620,"counter":295,"content":"<p>The war in Ukraine is something we thought we would never see again in 21st century Europe.

I know this country will do its utmost to help to relieve the people of Ukraine and offer them sanctuary.  Each night on news bulletins we see further loss of life and devastation of infrastructure in Ukraine.  In the few short minutes available to me I will explore the consequences of this war in Ukraine and the reality that it brings to us as politicians in this Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  Energy and food security are something we have taken for granted, but the war in Ukraine has shown us how vulnerable our country and the EU as a whole are.  Food and energy are two essential components of life and food security was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Rome in 1957.  It was one of the principal reasons for establishing the European Economic Community, as it was at the time.  Over the past decade, food security has slipped significantly down that agenda, and we can now see that we are vulnerable.  We are dependent on food from other parts of the world, and when the supply is threatened, the entire supply chain is imperilled.<\/p>  <p>  We can see the cost of raw materials doubling, tripling and quadrupling.  I was told the other day that urea will be &euro;1,500 per tonne before the spring is out.  That will affect our capacity to produce food.  As we stand here today, there are 800 million people in the world starving and 2 billion people on an inadequate diet.  Unfortunately, before the year is out, those figures will have multiplied.  We must go back to basics and ensure food security.  The food must be produced sustainably and we must recognise climate change but some of the policy agendas that have been pushed over the past decade must now be reassessed.  Food security must again become the cornerstone of EU agricultural policy.<\/p>  <p>  Energy is in the same bracket and, again, we must recognise climate change.  There is a cost for fuel in this country, however, and the changes we have been making are having a severe impact.  Today, at the invitation of Deputy Mattie McGrath, we had a presentation from agricultural contractors in the audiovisual room, which showed the huge economic hardship being put on them.  There is a ban on cutting peat in this country.  I met representatives of the horticultural industry today and even if they can get the peat they need, the cost of importing it will break the industry.  We must bring common sense policies back into play and recognise that energy and food security are the two most important issues for the citizens of both this country and the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000043#VV00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1648651620,"counter":296,"content":"<p>What is happening in Ukraine remains an outrage not just to Europe but the entire world.

In Ireland, however, we must continue to support the Ukrainian people in Ukraine, Poland and in other countries on the borders, as well as here in Ireland as best we can.  I repeat what the T&aacute;naiste said a number of weeks ago about refugees arriving here.  <\/p> <p>We must do our best with all that is available to us.  I commend the Red Cross on the extraordinary work it has done and the exceptional generosity of the Irish people who, the last I checked, have donated over &euro;20 million to charitable causes in an effort to support the Ukrainians arriving into Ireland.  That, backed up with 22,000 offers of accommodation, is an extraordinary sign of solidarity with the people of Ukraine.<\/p> <p> Sanctions of course are not the only way in which we can influence this war and its outcome.  We must also ensure that our opportunity to speak directly to the Russian Federation is not lost in this.

It is an extraordinarily important component even in the face of atrocities and war crimes.<\/p> <p> We must ensure that the children of Ukraine who are on our shores are supported in every way possible.  That includes various Departments fast-tracking the qualifications recognition of teachers, support staff and linguists to ensure the children are supported in the classroom.  The humanitarian aid this country has supported through its grant of &euro;20 million to various schemes on the ground is ensuring that the food shortages that are being seen in Ukraine are being addressed.  As has been mentioned by many colleagues, the Government must ensure that the human trafficking opportunity which I regret to say is present in this crisis is supported here to ensure that it does not occur.<\/p> <p> We in Ireland need to be seen to support the accession of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia to the European project as quickly as possible.

They have all been working together.  We need a co-ordinator here.  All these agencies are doing a great job but there needs to be one lead agency.

That response has been hugely important within local communities and for voluntary groups.  We have to commend their truly incredible work to date.<\/p>  <p>  In my own county of Mayo we have not been found wanting when it comes to providing homes for Ukrainians, with over 300 having been accommodated in Breaffy House Hotel outside Castlebar.  The local Candle of Grace charity organisation has also been to the fore, helping to find homes around the county for over 30 families and also sending aid to Red Cross units supporting refugees in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  The activation of the community response forum will be an important element to enhance local co-ordination for community and voluntary response.  We saw how successful that was during Covid-19.  Putting those structures in place now will be an important step forward.

I add my voice again to everyone else's in saying we need to show absolute solidarity with the Ukrainian people.  Part of that involves having a response that is adequate to a massive humanitarian disaster.  We did not think we would have millions of people on the move directly in modern-day Europe.  We are well used to disaster and humanitarian situations.  We all know the Western world has not necessarily paid attention to places like Yemen and Palestine over many years.  The fact is we are dealing with an absolute nightmare on our doorstep.  We are a much smaller Europe than we were 20 or 30 years ago.  Therefore we are very much connected with this.

At a European level and at a State level, we must be imaginative.  We need to look at solutions that will deal with both.  This is one of those cases about which we have already been taught by the pandemic where the State will have to do heavy lifting.

We need to provide them with some sort of normality as soon as possible and that necessarily entails prompt access to education.  Principals and school boards across the country have made incredible efforts to find space in our schools for Ukrainian children.  It is a remarkable effort.  School communities have rallied around Ukrainian children and young people, donating uniforms and books.  I acknowledge the Minister's announcements last Friday on regional education and language teams to co-ordinate supports for Ukrainian students.<\/p>  <p>  More can and must be done, however, to ensure that all the necessary educational supports are available in a timely and accessible manner to those arriving from Ukraine.  For many parents, one of their first priorities is to try to give their child some sense of normality and some sense of socialisation, and a school is central to that.  It is important that we do not lose sight of the other refugees not from Ukraine who are coming to this country.  Of course, the Ukraine group is the largest in scale.  I visited Mount Sion Primary School in Waterford on Friday and the principal was five or ten minutes late because they were dealing with an Afghan family who had just arrived into the school.  We need to deal with those challenges as well and treat all equally.<\/p>  <p>  While schools have shown enormous generosity and goodwill, it is inevitable that taking in additional students will put pressure on stretched resources.  It is crucial the Department provides the funds necessary for schools to facilitate these students.  A centralised Ukraine assistance fund that schools can directly apply to - for example, to meet the cost of additional furniture, books, uniforms and all that is required - would be of value.  I raised previously the need for additional language support teachers, which is important.  To alleviate the pressure on that until the Minister can put it in place, I reiterate my call for a database to be set up of both school-aged children and teaching staff who have arrived from Ukraine and their location on the island.  A further database of schools across the country, which have indicated that they have space, should be published on the Department's website so Ukrainian families can get their child settled into a local school as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  We need a cross-departmental approach to supporting these children and young people and I would urge the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to work in tandem to provide holistic mental health supports as they are required to ensure these young children are integrated into their communities.

US Administrations helped China's rapid growth, especially after the Beijing Government was allowed into the World Trade Organization.  America's political establishment told itself a fairy story that China would liberalise.  As for Russia, its return as a military power was enabled by the Europeans buying Russian natural gas and oil in a vain attempt to look green at home and turning a blind eye to Putin's increasingly despotic rule.<\/p>  <p>  European leaders, including successive Irish Governments, told themselves a fairy story that Russia would liberalise.  We had ample evidence that we were making a mistake.  We now have farmers who cannot get their hands on fertiliser in this country.

We have rumours that Russian ships were heading to Ireland full of fertiliser only to steer off into France as they are not welcome in Ireland.

We condemn the destruction of a much newer democratic country and the brutal, savage murder of its population.  The artillery attacks on apartment blocks, schools and maternity hospitals are the actions of a coward's army to suppress the general population by the mass slaughter and murder of women and children.<\/p>  <p>  The Russian ambassador to Ireland lacked all credibility in his interviews with the Irish media and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in the weeks preceding the invasion of Ukraine.  There is no respect for his office and he has lost all credibility.  While I accept the advice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the expulsion of the ambassador, I hope the latter will have the human decency to retire and remove himself from this country as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the security review conducted in recent days and the consequent views expressed to the ambassador yesterday, whereby four so-called Russian diplomats have been ordered to leave our country.  Ireland has a significant role to play in this regard in that it campaigned long and hard to achieve a UN Security Council seat for this year and next.  It appears we had intelligence that the invasion was going to happen some months before it occurred and that the united nations of the world could not prevent it from happening.  What if any democratic nation had a right to request the United Nations to send to it a peace-enforcement mission or unit from all other nations, particularly militarily neutral nations, to secure its borders from invasion, such that if another country did invade, it would be attacking all the other countries of the world and not a military alliance such as NATO?<\/p>  <p>  When this war is over, the UN needs to conduct a comprehensive review of the rules of war, including in respect of what constitutes a war crime and the penalties for infringement; the treatment of civilians, particularly women and children, in the war zone; the shelling and bombing of, and missile attacks on, what are clearly civilian areas; the security and safety of nuclear facilities in the war zone and the creation of a safe zone around them; the use of chemical weapons; and the payment of reparation for the reconstruction of war-torn cities and towns.  Ireland can play a role in formulating the new rules and must do so in its time left on the UN Security Council.  In the case of the illegal war rained on Ukraine by Russia, any assets or cash seized by states from Russian oligarchs should in the first instance be ring-fenced and used to rebuild Ukraine.  I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with the Taoiseach, seek support for this policy around the table of the UN Security Council.<\/p>  <p>  I am puzzled by the hypocrisy of the Russian state regarding the remarks of US President Biden about Mr. Putin staying in office as unacceptable.  While this is a matter for the people of Russia to decide, the Russian state deems it completely acceptable for it to invade Ukraine, a democratic country of 46 million people, the primary aim being regime change.  Surely, it is the right of the people of Ukraine to decide what sort of government it wants to have and the international organisations it wants to join.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the address of President Zelenskiy to the D&aacute;il next week.  I suggest to the Minister that arrangements be made to broadcast his address on big screens in some of our cities and towns.  In Dublin, for example, the park in Merrion Square would be an ideal location.  We should encourage Ukrainian refugees who are living here to attend.  We will all stand with Ukraine and its people on the day.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I visited Lisdoonvarna, where I met and engaged with volunteers who work with Lisdoonvarna F&aacute;ilte.  I met many Ukrainian refugees who have made their way to County Clare.  I pay tribute to the local community organisations in Lisdoonvarna and elsewhere in the county, including Ballyvaughan, Kilkee, Shannon and Ennis, which have given such a warm welcome to Ukrainian people.  I pay tribute to Clare Local Development Company, An Garda, the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, the Red Cross, the Department of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The community-development organisation Lisdoonvarna F&aacute;ilte is doing tremendous work under the management of Ms Jacqueline McCoy and her team.<\/p>  <p>  Issues have emerged that need to be addressed.  For example, there is a glaring need to provide refugees with access to new shoes, lunch boxes and clothes, but shoes are a much-needed commodity.

I do not think there can be any room for being neutral in a linguistic sense on an issue like this.  What is happening in Ukraine is an appalling human rights catastrophe and a criminal act by a desperate Putin regime.  The murder and mayhem inflicted on Ukraine, the levelling of homes and cities and the fact that 50% of the children of Ukraine are now homeless or are refugees on the move as a result of an appalling act have rightly moved the entire world to respond as it has done.<\/p>  <p>  It is somewhat unfortunate that some in the House would seek to criticise our appropriate response because we do not respond in a similar fashion to other wars elsewhere in the globe.  It is true to say that this is in our backyard and has particular resonance because it is the first full-scale war on European soil and is happening on the borders of the European Union.  For that reason, it is different.  Nonetheless, all wars are appalling, be they in Ukraine, Iraq, Yemen, Syria or anywhere else.  Some find it difficult to be on the side of the European Union, the United Nations or USA and to be critical of former colleagues in Marxist-Leninist countries like Russia.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Government on its political response.  At an EU level, we have been in the vanguard of endeavours and, in particular, in our role at the United Nations.  This conflict has exposed the failings of the United Nations structurally.  In the context of the broader debate about neutrality, the House could consider why we should outsource our right to act as a people in terms of the veto capacity in the United Nations, in particular the veto of Russia on the Security Council.  That is something that needs to be factored into the broader debate on neutrality and where we sit on this issue.  I have been particularly heartened by the political response at Government and European Union levels and by the efforts at United Nations level, flawed and all as that organisation is.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a whole-of-government issue.  I appreciate that the Ministers, Deputies Coveney and O'Gorman, are, in many respects, the personification of the challenge that we face in terms of what is happening in Ukraine and how it is impacting on our shores.  Every Department has a role to play.  Others have referenced the impact on agriculture and education, health services and energy services.  We would do well to reflect on energy policy here in light of what is happening in Ukraine and how it has brought home to us our excessive dependence on imported fuels.  <\/p>  <p>  If the lights go off here, nothing will undermine the consensus around the agenda for sustainable development and energy policy more than such an act.  We will be foolish to be ideologically hidebound on such matters and should acknowledge that transition fuels, as we progress to a journey of reduced dependence on non-renewable energy sources, are something we would do well to take on board.<\/p>  <p>  We need to consider the scale of the challenge we are facing, whether it is 14,000, 24,000, 40,000 or 100,000 refugees.  Whatever the numbers are, we will very quickly be confronted with the magnitude of that challenge and how it manifests itself in what some would consider to be the less than optimal accommodation we can offer.  That is why the Irish Red Cross needs to reach out to local authorities, in particular, as well as local development companies, etc., to examine how they could assist in, for example, processing the 20,000 offers of accommodation.  The need for that is evident from the people I know who have registered their interest with the Irish Red Cross and have not been contacted yet.<\/p>  <p>  Given the scale of the challenge now unfolding in terms of the numbers arriving here, it is clear that the Irish Red Cross needs assistance.  It is not a sign of weakness to acknowledge that.  We are grappling with an enormous challenge, and we need to take assistance wherever we can get it.  Local authorities are well positioned to process some of the offers of accommodation.  Not all of them will materialise.  Therefore, we have to be prepared for the visualisation of temporary accommodation as a solution.  We have heard commentary around tented towns and villages.  For example, the Green Glens Arena in Millstreet is gearing up for this effort.  No community has better experience in the country than Millstreet in terms of its previous capacity in dealing with direct provision, etc.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government's response has mirrored, at a political and humanitarian level, the response of the Irish people, which has been quite extraordinary.  There are difficult days ahead.  Nobody is suggesting that we should limit our ambition.  We should respond appropriately and not put a ceiling on the numbers, but the numbers will be very difficult to deal with and that is why the Irish Red Cross needs to reach out to local government in particular.  It is very well equipped and has shown its capacity to reach out and deal with matters at a local level such as, for example, the Covid response.  We need to consider local authorities stepping in to assist the Irish Red Cross in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I want to conclude on the point that one of the first casualties of war is truth and we need to differentiate between the Putin regime and the Russian people.  We need to explore, as a global community, ways to get our message across to the broader Russian population because I do not believe would necessarily support the kind of inhumane atrocities being inflicted on Ukraine at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1454"},{"type":"speech","time":1648654020,"counter":314,"content":"<p>What is going on in Ukraine is truly horrific, and I want to express my solidarity with the Ukrainian people and join the call for an end to this terrible war.

I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise the more than 14,200 people who have been arrested in Russia for taking part in anti-war demonstrations in many locations across Russia to protest Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s unforgivable invasion of Ukraine.

More people will be radicalised when they see the difference in how refugees are treated. <\/p>  <p>  I know the EU has put in place a temporary protection directive to allow Ukrainian citizens fleeing Ukraine to move through the EU in a manner akin to EU citizens.

It is completely unjust that these people will not be entitled to the same protections as Ukrainian citizens.<\/p> <p>Victims of war are victims of war no matter what their citizenship is.  Victims should be treated equally and with respect.  We cannot even begin to imagine the difficulties these victims have had to face.  The last thing we should be doing is creating barriers for people already facing such difficulty.  We need to further our efforts in supporting these victims and we need to ensure the Department provides support and services to assist all people displaced within Ukraine.<\/p> <p> This assistance should, of course, be offered to all refugees fleeing war, including those in Afghanistan, Yemen, Palestine and Syria.  Everyone deserves safe and humane living conditions no matter what their citizenship or which country they are fleeing.  We must make sure we do all we can to provide safe and humane conditions.  That includes the end of direct provision, something that has been promised by this Government but is yet to be seen on the ground.  We need to start properly discussing accommodation needs for those fleeing war and we need to move beyond short-term planning, although doing so is currently difficult because this war has only just begun and we are trying to deal with issues as they arise.<\/p> <p> When it comes to real and physical support and assistance we can lend to victims of war, there are certain things that should be prioritised.  We should focus on using our resources for accommodation centres and refugee schemes rather than for military expenditure.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, stated earlier today that a Bill to enshrine neutrality \"would prevent us putting our money where our mouth is\" on issues such as Ukraine.  That money should be put into providing the safest spaces possible for those fleeing war, not on compromising our neutrality or satisfying the military industrial complex.<\/p> <p> I have often spoken about the importance of Ireland's neutrality.  The topic has been discussed a worrying amount lately and I have been openly vocal about my concerns in respect of where these talks are leading us.  The Taoiseach recently stated that a citizens&rsquo; assembly should consider Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality.  I think he is hoping the assembly will come up with a fudge that will allow him to get rid of it.  I cannot understand why some Members of this House are pushing this conversation so much.  The Irish people have always voted overwhelmingly to maintain and protect our neutrality.  Why is the Government seeking to undermine this?  Is it responding to the pressures of the EU and NATO over the wishes of its own citizens or is it looking for foreign direct investment that we are currently losing out on?<\/p> <p> Neutrality contributes to the strengthening of peace and security at a global level and plays a vital role in developing peaceful, friendly and mutually beneficial relations between countries.  Neutrality does not have to mean sitting back and doing nothing.  In fact, Irish neutrality in effect has never done this.  Why would it be assumed that we should start now?  We can be neutral in a very active way through increased support for war victims and a strong and diplomatic stance.  For example, I welcome the decision yesterday to expel four senior Russian diplomats.  That is the type of stand we must continue to make.<\/p> <p> We should be proud that approximately 600 people are arriving every day to Ireland from Ukraine and that it is estimated that 30,000 Ukrainian refugees will be based here by the end of April.  Let us start focusing more on how we can assist these people and less on how we can please NATO by compromising our proud and long-standing policy of military neutrality.  We need to remember what is important in all of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648654620,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Connolly.

This morning, the Minister quoted Desmond Tutu as saying, \"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\"  He was absent from the Chamber when I addressed this earlier, so I will repeat it.  First, there are many other things Desmond Tutu said that the Minister could have quoted to capture the peaceful man he was - a person who abhorred war on every level.  The Minister did not do so.  The suggestion or innuendo is that we who stand up and say not to carry out war in our name and not to get rid of our neutrality are somehow on the side of the oppressor-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000048#AAA00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1648654620,"counter":318,"content":"<p>That is not what I said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000048#AAA00400","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1648654620,"counter":319,"content":"<p>-----but we have repeatedly come into this House on the side of peace and trying to get a more equal world to ensure we will not have wars on an ongoing basis.  Speaking several years ago about the arms trade, Desmond Tutu said he had learned a lot about the business of war.  He continued:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn my opinion [the arms trade] is the modern slave trade.  It is an industry out of control: every day more than 1,000 people are killed by conventional weapons.  The vast majority of those people are innocent men, women and children. <\/blockquote>  <p>In the two minutes I have remaining, I do not have time to go through 20 years of the ongoing militarisation of Europe, starting with the Maastricht treaty and going on to include permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, the European Defence Agency and the European Defence Fund.  All the while, the drums of war being beaten by the arms industry have had an open door into Europe and determining a strategic compass when we should be looking at a moral compass.I make no apologies for raising my voice, something I rarely do, for peace.  We should be using our neutral strong voice to bring peace and to ensure our role on the Security Council is not used in a way that is warmongering with the EU leaders who have done it for years.  Look at what Josep Borrell Fontelles has said.  Look at the comment of Jean-Claude Juncker that we need a fully fledged European defence force.  Look at what the arms company Raytheon said.  It said, &quot;We are not vendors; we are partners.&quot;  They are not vendors.  Can you imagine?  Such is the obfuscation of language.  When war is discussed, it is masked with a peace facility.  There is discussion of battle groups and it is stated they are for peace.<\/p><p>I am totally opposed to the militarisation of Europe.  I am totally opposed to using this horrific war to further more wars.  I am appealing to the Minister to use Ireland's voice in the world of diplomacy to ensure we can get peace as quickly as possible and to stop further needless deaths.  The President of Ukraine has spoken about having a neutral Ukraine.  I do not think he is happy about that but he would certainly be agreeable to it as one of the many components involved in reaching a peaceful solution to this crisis.  I do not know why the voice of Ireland, as a neutral country, was not raised previously in respect of Ukraine being a neutral country.  .  That could be one of many components to ensure a lasting peace.  The Acting Chairman asked me to stop, so I will stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000048#AAA00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1648654620,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I assure the House that the Government is doing everything it can to try to make appropriate diplomatic interventions.  There are far more Members on the other side of the House talking about neutrality than there are on this side.  Every day, my Department and I look at how we can use international organisations and multilateralism to try to make interventions for peace.  I will not have the argument skewed in a different direction.  Nobody in this House is warmongering or looking to militarise the European Union but we do want to have an open, honest and evidence-based discussion on security and defence issues, given the fact that there is enormous war at the heart of Europe, bordering four EU countries.  That does change the debate and we have to recognise that.  It does not mean that we move away from our traditional stance of non-alignment militarily but it certainly means that we need to be aware of threats and respond to them.<\/p>  <p>  These are dark times for Ukraine.  We have welcomed and will continue to welcome thousands of Ukrainians fleeing war.  Ireland has been enriched by our Ukrainian community and it is right that we have offered the Ukrainian people a place of safety in this hour of need.  I thank Deputies across the House for their continued engagement on the issues arising out of the Ukraine crisis, a crisis caused by Russian aggression against a sovereign nation.  Ukraine&rsquo;s experience in the past month has resonated deeply with all of us and it is right that we discuss in the House the plight of Ukrainians, alongside discussion of Ireland&rsquo;s response.<\/p>  <p>  The domestic response already outlined is of great importance.  Ireland has reacted quickly and put systems in place to welcome and help Ukrainians arriving here.  This reflects the natural outpouring of welcome shown by Irish people.  However, it is also important that, internationally, Ireland continues to demonstrate unwavering solidarity with Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Ireland&rsquo;s engagement at the EU, UN and beyond, is characterised by strong and consistent support for Ukraine.  As a friend to Ukraine, it is incumbent on us to stand up and clearly restate the truth every time the world is confronted by disinformation regarding this unacceptable attack by Russia on Ukraine.<\/p> <p> As a member of the UN Security Council and across the multilateral system, Ireland has been at the forefront of efforts to try to bring an end to this conflict.  We have consistently condemned Russia&rsquo;s unjustified, unprovoked and illegal invasion.  We have used our voice on the United Nations Security Council to express our steadfast support for Ukraine and have consistently countered false Russian narratives. <\/p> <p> Ireland has co-sponsored two strong resolutions at the General Assembly, which were supported by the overwhelming majority of UN member states, condemning Russia&rsquo;s further invasion and calling for safe and unhindered humanitarian access.  This work is ongoing.<\/p> <p> Just yesterday, the Security Council briefed on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and Ireland expressed our deep concern at reports of Russian deportations or, quite frankly, abductions, where Ukrainian citizens are taken forcibly across the border and into Russia.  This is absolutely unacceptable.  Ireland also took this opportunity to counter Russian disinformation on food security.  It is Russia&rsquo;s war on Ukraine that is driving up food prices and food insecurity around the world, not sanctions.<\/p> <p> This is of global concern.  Russia&rsquo;s large-scale invasion of Ukraine is compounding other challenges to food security, such as recent droughts, floods and other conflicts, that were already increasing prices and squeezing supply chains.  Before this conflict, the World Food Programme, which provides food to the most vulnerable people around the world, purchased 50% of its wheat from Ukraine.  War is limiting the capacity of Ukrainian farmers to plant, harvest and export grain.  Future harvests are therefore already lost, with longer-term serious consequences for global food security and humanitarian crises.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, Ireland also spoke at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council on Ukraine.  Ireland was clear that the invasion has had grave consequences for human rights as well as increasing humanitarian needs.  The Human Rights Council has established a commission of inquiry into the alleged abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law in the context of the Russia&rsquo;s aggression against Ukraine.<\/p> <p> Ireland sees the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, as the key organisation at which dialogue on European security issues can take place. We are actively countering Russian disinformation narratives through that forum.  Ireland has signed up to the Moscow Mechanism of the OSCE, a human rights tool which essentially allows for a panel of experts to be appointed to investigate alleged human rights abuses.<\/p> <p> Ireland played an important role in the decision earlier this month to exclude Russia from the Council of Europe.  This unprecedented act reflects the strong condemnation of Russia&rsquo;s unprovoked aggression.  We will continue to seek the end of these unjustified hostilities during our forthcoming Presidency of the Council this year.<\/p> <p> The EU has, of course, been the central focus for Ireland&rsquo;s support of Ukraine.  The EU has acted in unity in its response.  Since Russia&rsquo;s assault began, foreign ministers and leaders have met almost weekly and the EU has imposed successive sanctions packages of an unprecedented breadth and depth on Russian interests.  Ireland has contributed in full to the European Peace Facility &euro;1 billion military assistance package for Ukraine.  Ireland's total share will be &euro;22 million, which will go towards non-lethal elements.  We have also provided ready-to-eat meals and body armour to the Ukrainian military.<\/p> <p> EU foreign ministers also agreed on 21 February to provide an emergency macrofinancial assistance operation of &euro;1.2 billion in the form of loans to foster stability in Ukraine.  This is already being disbursed and is providing swift support in a situation of acute crisis to strengthen Ukraine&rsquo;s resilience.<\/p> <p> Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership.  EU leaders acted swiftly earlier this month and invited the European Commission to submit its opinion on Ukraine's application to become a member.  EU leaders reiterated that invitation to the Commission at their meeting in Brussels at the end of last week.  Ireland has also come together with a grouping of other EU member states that are similarly strongly supportive of Ukraine&rsquo;s application with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.  <\/p> <p> Separately, I would like to address briefly the Government&rsquo;s decision to request that four senior officials from the Russian embassy leave the State.  While we will not be entering into specifics about the intelligence assessment that led to this decision, we are satisfied we have taken the most appropriate course of action in the circumstances.  I would also note that a significant number of other EU countries have taken similar actions.  At the same time and as I stated yesterday, the Government continues to believe diplomatic channels between Ireland and the Russian Federation should remain open.  This is in the interests of our own citizens as well as to ensure we can continue to convey our views to the Russian Federation in the context of Ukraine and other issues.<\/p> <p> I want to share with the House that all of Ireland&rsquo;s support is very much appreciated by Ukraine.  I spoke to the foreign minister of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, on Monday, and he thanked Ireland for its ongoing support.  Last week, on 25 March, he stated that Ireland is &ldquo;at the forefront within the EU and beyond providing essential support for Ukraine in all possible ways&rdquo;.<\/p> <p> On Friday, 1 April, we will have the privilege to mark 30 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Ukraine.  Next week, Ukraine&rsquo;s President Zelenskiy will address us in a joint sitting of these Houses.  This anniversary comes at a sombre time for Ukraine but it is during hard times that true friendships are proven and Ireland is doing everything it can to support Ukraine through this dark time.  I know other countries will continue to do the same and I look forward to future discussion and debate with perhaps a bit more optimism as we try to find a way to stop this madness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000048#AAA00600","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1648655220,"counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000049#BBB00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1648655220,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  In many ways, over the past two decades, waste policy has been Ireland&rsquo;s unsung environmental success story.  We have progressed from a situation where the State was facing prosecution before the European courts for lack of enforcement of unlicensed landfills to one where we have both radically reduced our dependence on landfill and our enforcement programme against unlicensed activity has been hailed by the European Commission as a model of best practice for resolving large-scale waste infringements.<\/p>  <p>  However, that is the past and we must look to the future where we will have to meet increasingly ambitious European targets for recycling and reuse, where we must reduce our dependence on the vagaries of international markets for waste export, and where we fully embrace the social, economic and environmental opportunities of a circular economy.  More fundamentally, we must meet the challenge of a future where we cannot continue to rely on complex global supply chains to the extent we do today, where all countries will be faced with the reality of increased competition for raw materials, and where the pace of primary resource extraction is far outstripping the planet&rsquo;s capacity to meet our needs in the long term.<\/p>  <p>  The foundations of the linear economy based around the take-make-waste model are creaking at the seams.  Embracing a regenerative circular economy, where waste is minimised, where economic growth is decoupled from resource consumption, and where the value of goods and materials is retained in our economy for as long as possible, is an environmental, economic and strategic necessity for Ireland.  This Bill sets out a comprehensive suite of regulatory policy and economic measures that, taken together, will help us to embrace the opportunities of a future defined by this circular transition.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will provide the necessary legislative basis to place several key measures, including the circular economy strategy, the circular economy programme and the national food waste prevention programme, on a statutory footing.  The adoption in December last year of a high-level whole-of-government circular economy strategy plays a fundamental role and provides an overarching policy framework that works for the public, private and voluntary sectors.  The first version of the strategy, published in December, sets out the first high-level steps we need to take to make the transition possible.<\/p> <p>The first version of the strategy is, by design, a high-level document which aims to communicate the Government's overall approach to the circular economy, but subsequent iterations will feature increasingly detailed and ambitious targets.  The Bill provides that the statutory version of the strategy may feature both economy-wide and sectoral targets, and it sets out the supporting actions necessary to achieve those targets.  Following enactment of the Bill, I intend to commence work on the second, more action-orientated version of the strategy, which will then be on a statutory basis as a priority this year.<\/p> <p> The circular economy programme was also launched in December.  It is being implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which will provide critical evidence-led support to achieving our national policy objectives.  The new programme builds on and encompasses the agency's previous national waste prevention programme, which has been integral to our national success in waste policy outcomes, adding new elements and a new focus specifically related to supporting the circular economy.  The Bill provides that these new elements will have the same statutory basis as the programme's pre-existing waste prevention measures, which are currently provided for in the Waste Management Act.<\/p> <p> Food waste is a global problem that has environmental, social and economic consequences.  Worldwide, more than one quarter of food that is produced is wasted.  A public consultation on Ireland's first draft national food waste prevention roadmap was launched by my Department last January and it will conclude this week.  The roadmap will set out a series of actions to achieve the Government's ambition to halve Ireland's food waste by 2030.  Key areas of focus in the draft roadmap include establishing Ireland's baseline data on food waste, from which we will set out to achieve a 50% reduction by 2030.  This 50% target derives from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  Placing the strategy, programme and roadmap on a statutory footing will ensure that the circular economy transition remains a national policy priority.<\/p> <p> The Bill will also give the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications the power to introduce new environmental levies on single-use items and, in due course, to prohibit the placing on the market of certain environmentally harmful products, replacing and building on existing powers currently set out in legislation on waste.  The new levies will work in a similar way to the plastic bag levy, with the proceeds ring-fenced in a circular economy fund for projects relating to environmental and climate action objectives.  The various levies will be introduced incrementally.  However, the initial focus will be the introduction of levies on disposable hot drinks cups.  Levies and bans will only be introduced where more sustainable alternatives are readily available to the consumer.  They will not be applied to any product which remains necessary for reasons of food safety or to prevent food wastage.<\/p> <p> The objective of the new levies is not to raise revenue.  Indeed, the aim of introducing them is to encourage the use of reusable alternatives so that the consumer never incurs the levy in the first place.  The precise details regarding scope and rate of the levy on disposable coffee cups will be set out in secondary legislation following enactment of the Bill, with the intention of bringing the levy into force as early as possible.  The new levies will build on Ireland's successful experience of the plastic bag levy and the landfill levy.  I look forward to introducing the levy on disposable coffee cups as soon as possible this year and I expect to see a rapid and significant surge in the use of reusable cups and a decline in coffee cup litter across the country.<\/p> <p> I believe the use of economic instruments to incentivise sustainable behaviour can work.  We have seen it work with plastic bags and with landfill.  I am also firmly of the view that if levies are carefully applied on the basis of a strong evidence base, they will produce more sustainable consumption patterns and will not result in increased costs to businesses and consumers.  Businesses should be able to achieve savings due to the reduced need to stock disposable items such as single-use coffee cups.  Where those businesses pass those savings to customers who avail of reusable products, and I hope they will, the consumer also benefits.  In addition, if we can successfully embed reusable items in our daily habits, that provides opportunities for new business models based on activities such as deposit-return schemes and reverse logistics.<\/p> <p> To support this development and to reduce further any costs associated with the levy on consumers and businesses, I intend to target specifically a portion of the income from the new environmental levies towards projects and schemes that will increase the availability of reusable products and packaging.  Recognising the role played by the environment fund since its inception and the need to align its objectives more closely with the promotion of the circular economy, the environment fund will be replaced by a new circular economy fund under the Bill.  This fund will continue to support key environmental projects in the coming years.<\/p> <p> The Bill will also make important amendments to the Waste Management Act to support the delivery of further actions in the waste action plan.  In the context of waste enforcement, the Bill will advance a number of priority provisions, including the use of technologies such as closed circuit television, CCTV, for waste enforcement purposes in a way that is fully in compliance with national and EU data protection law.  Littering and dumping deface both our rural and urban landscapes.  They are a serious threat to our environment and, in terms of both enforcement and clean up, they result in significant costs for local authorities.  At local level, we all are aware from our constituency work of how much littering and dumping can affect our local communities.  They are also issues that cause great upset for citizens, spoiling local beauty spots and often undoing the invaluable work that is undertaken by Tidy Towns groups, committees and volunteers.<\/p> <p> A combination of legislation, guidance and the use of mandatory codes of practice provided for in the Bill will ensure that the processing of personal data may be carried out by local authorities tasked with enforcing litter and waste law.  This will provide an important deterrent to protect our environment from the scourge of littering and illegal dumping while at the same time respecting the privacy rights of citizens.  I am very aware there will be concerns regarding data privacy in light of these new powers.  I assure Deputies that these concerns have been to the fore in drafting the relevant sections of the Bill.  Local authorities will only be able to use these new powers in respect of waste enforcement and littering.  The Bill prevents any possibility of mission creep in that regard.<\/p> <p> Local authorities will have to address whether the use of CCTV and other technologies are necessary and proportionate with regard to the specific issues they wish to tackle.  They will be required to carry out regular reviews of their use of these technologies to ensure that they remain necessary and proportionate.  No deployment of these technologies will be permitted until the relevant code of practice is in place.  The codes, which will set out in detail the operational requirements for minimising data intrusion, will be subject to ministerial approval.  The Bill also explicitly prohibits the use of automated number plate recognition and automatic facial recognition for waste enforcement and anti-littering purposes.  Having consulted with both the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the local government sector, I do not believe that either of these technologies is necessary or proportionate for the purposes of the Bill.<\/p> <p> My Department has very much welcomed the involvement of the Data Protection Commissioner in the development of these provisions and I expect that this co-operation will continue in the context of the development of codes of practice.  This will support an ongoing effort by local authorities to tackle illegal dumping and littering.  Provision will also be made for the use of fixed-penalty notices for additional waste streams, including under the extended producer responsibility model for dealing with waste tyres.  The changes proposed have the general aim of providing for more proportionate and focused enforcement.  The combination of legislation, guidance and the use of mandatory codes of practice will ensure that processing of personal data may be carried out by local authorities tasked with enforcing litter and waste law, thus providing an important deterrent in order to protect our environment from the scourge of littering and illegal dumping while at the same time respecting the privacy rights of citizens.<\/p> <p> Further provisions of the Bill will help drive better segregation of waste in the commercial sector.  EPA statistics indicate that 70% of the material placed in general waste bins should be in recycling or organic bins.  This, in turn, will help us to achieve our EU targets for recycling and landfill.  My expectation is that providing for better segregation of commercial waste, with recyclable material separated from general waste in the same manner which currently applies to households, will ultimately save businesses money through lower collection costs.  The Bill also provides for powers to include additional requirements in the permits held by waste collectors.<\/p> <p> In tandem with the new environmental levies, the Bill provides for the introduction of a new waste recovery levy.  This will apply to waste sent for recovery, that is, for incineration or for landfill back-filling here in Ireland or exported abroad for those purposes.  This new recovery levy will complement the existing landfill levy and will further improve the relative economic incentives for waste holders to choose recycling or reuse over other disposal methods.  In common with the landfill levy, revenue from the waste recovery levy will be ring-fenced in the new circular economy fund.<\/p> <p> The Bill will help streamline and improve the end-of-waste and by-product application processes that are currently administered by the EPA.  These two regulatory processes provide a means whereby material that would otherwise be disposed of as waste can be safely reused, for example, in the form of secondary raw materials.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>This could be particularly significant for our construction sector, providing more options in terms of recycled materials and reducing the sector's material footprint.  The measures proposed in the Bill will help drive higher quality applications.  Ultimately, they will tailor the level of regulatory scrutiny of applications relative to their environmental risk.  The Bill will end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and mining of coal, lignite, oil and oil shale.  This will consolidate our policy of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.<\/p> <p> The Bill marks a watershed moment in how Ireland will address its resource needs in the coming decades.  The measures proposed are ambitious but they are also considered.  The circular economy, if it is to be successful, must work for everyone.  It must provide opportunities and it must reduce costs for consumers at the same time as it reduces the environmental impact of our consumption and production patterns.  The powers provided for have been subject in most cases to extensive consultations with stakeholders, either directly as the Bill has been drafted or through other processes.  In this regard I thank the Oireachtas joint committee for its contributions during the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I will address how I will respond to the committee's recommendations in my closing remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000049#BBB00300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648656420,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Today's globalised economy is overwhelmingly based on a linear model of production and consumption.  We take, make and then waste.  The environmental impact of a linear throwaway model in which we extract great quantities of natural resources to make things we may only use once before disposing of them is not sustainable.  It is estimated the raw material resources we use in a year is already 50% more than nature can replenish in a year.  On present trends, this will rise to a factor of three by 2050.  The circular economy offers an alternative, whereby waste and resource use is minimised and the value of products and materials is maintained as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Getting items repaired instead of binning them and remanufacturing items by taking them apart and using parts again in new items has the potential to decrease the amount of primary resource extraction and reduce the carbon impact of manufacturing and transporting single-use items.  We need to start thinking and acting in new ways.  Our planet simply demands it.  As a result, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes most aspects of the Bill.  What is unusual about the Bill is that the circular economy is not pioneering or anything new.  It tries to recreate what happened in days gone by.  Years ago, very little food was thrown away in homes.  People mended the soles of their shoes, sewed torn clothes and passed them down, and repaired broken household items.  Modern day consumerism has fuelled a damaging throwaway approach, resulting in huge, almost unimaginable, amounts of waste, something the Bill and a national strategy now seek to reverse.<\/p>  <p>  All of the responsibility to change this approach cannot be placed at the feet of workers and families.  The corporations that have profited hugely from this throwaway model need to be tackled and forced to take appropriate action to change their behaviour.  Last year I travelled to COP26 in Glasgow and highlighted the irony of the CEO of Amazon speaking at a major climate change conference when, just weeks earlier, a few miles up the road from Glasgow, the company he heads was found to be destroying millions of items of unsold stock every year, including smart televisions, laptops, drones and hairdryers, simply to ensure the excess did not impact on its profits.  It was a disgusting display of greed and waste.  While disposable cups might be the headline for the media today, there is no point charging consumers for using a coffee cup if such disgraceful behaviour by major corporations is not challenged and addressed by the Government and regulators.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to give the Minister the power to introduce new environmental levies on single-use items and, in the longer term, to prohibit placing on the market of certain environmentally harmful products.  A total of 91% of all plastics are single use and the rate of mass production since plastic became commonly used almost six decades ago has resulted in 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic pollution.  Single-use plastics are a scourge on our environment, with a vast amount ending up in our oceans and having a major impact on our marine ecosystems.  It was amazing to see the speed at which industries could abandon some single-use plastics and move to a more sustainable model when they had to under the EU single-use plastic directive that came into force last year.  It is a shame it took so long to address this, in addition to microplastics, with so much ending up in landfill and our oceans.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department raised the prospect of applying a levy on all classes of coffee cups, including plastic and biodegradable, to discourage the single-use approach and promote reusable alternatives.  Will the Minister of State give an update on what approach he intends to take in this area?  As he is aware, at the beginning of this year France banned the sale of certain fruit and vegetables that came wrapped in unnecessary plastic.  If we walk down the fruit and vegetable aisle of any supermarket in Ireland, the amount of needless plastic wrapping we see on some food is astonishing.  Such a ban is not included in the Bill.  I asked a parliamentary question on whether the Minister intends to follow the French example.  He indicated he was not planning to introduce a similar ban here as our supply chain is different from that of France and such a proposal would need to be examined further.  Has further consideration being given to this?  The amount of plastic wrapping we see is quite incredible.  There is a plastic sticker on every individual apple or orange or whatever it might be.<\/p>  <p>  On a related matter, one of the topics my colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, raised during pre-legislative scrutiny was the standard of biodegradable packaging and the importance of ensuring we simply do not replace single-use plastics with single-use biodegradable containers that have questionable content, for example, PFAS.  The environmental charity, VOICE Ireland, gave evidence during pre-legislative scrutiny that a compost bowl obtained in the Oireachtas canteen was the highest rated for PFAS, with 12 times the allowable amount of that chemical coating on the bowl.  These chemicals touch people's food, and when the container is composted, they can end up back in a farmer's field and in the food chain.  Recently, Denmark and California banned PFAS in food contact material.  Has the Minister of State given consideration to this?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the proposal in the Bill to draft a national food waste prevention strategy.  Despite the horrendous level of world hunger, more than one quarter of food produced worldwide is wasted.  In Ireland, people have become more conscientious about food waste in recent years.  The arrival of food waste prevention apps that allow people to buy excess food from shops and bakeries for a discount highlights the positive role that technology can play in fighting food waste.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, I raised the issue of the need for mandatory reporting by food businesses of the amount of food waste they generate and the actions taken to reduce such waste.  Under the provisions of the Bill and the strategy, we have to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030.  It is arguable that a mandatory 7% food waste reduction target should be set each year with appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure we can meet this target.  Will the Minister of State outline what consideration has been given to this mandatory approach?<\/p>  <p>  On the deposit return scheme, while the details of the proposed scheme are not included in the Bill, it forms a key part of the circular economy approach.  Last year, regulations were signed by the Minister for a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles and aluminium cans.  This is supposed to come into effect later this year.  While this is welcome and long overdue, Sinn F&eacute;in is strongly of the opinion that glass should be included in any new scheme.  A recommendation from pre-legislative scrutiny similarly noted that, as glass is an acceptable material for deposit return and for the development of collection, cleaning and refilling infrastructure, consideration should be given to including glass containers in any future expansion of a deposit return scheme.  Perhaps it is something the Minister of State might touch on in his closing remarks.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the new provisions that will allow local authorities to use CCTV and drones in a proportional manner to combat illegal dumping.  It is an absolute scourge.  I want to raise some questions on the Minister of State's engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p> <p>I expect we will have an opportunity to tease out those details on Committee Stage.  There is a fine line here and it is important to get the balance right with regard to the use of this technology.  It will require close scrutiny.<\/p> <p> On the circular economy fund, will the Minister of State outline how much will be in the environment fund?  What is the estimated annual income of this new circular economy fund?  Will he provide detail on the activities to be financed by that new fund?<\/p> <p> I will touch on a further point raised during prelegislative scrutiny, which has regard to repair shops.  We heard from various witnesses who had tried to do their very best with repair shops.  They told us of the barriers, hurdles and impediments they faced, one of which was the issue of VAT and insurance.  Has the Minister of State engaged with the Minister for Finance on these matters?<\/p> <p> We welcome the Bill.  There is a very significant amount in it.  How it impacts on the worst offenders, including businesses and corporations, will be important.  It cannot just be left to individuals.  We are happy to work with the Minister of State, who I know has taken a significant personal interest in and responsibility for bringing the Bill forward.  I look forward to working with him on Committee Stage and further stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000051#DDD00200","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648657020,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022 might sound remote to people who are struggling with the cost of living at the moment but it will actually matter to how we live our lives in the context of waste, emissions and climate change.  While I am pleased to support this Bill, it is important that we put it in the context of where we are in respect of consumption, waste and the climate crisis.  Anyone who has friends or family in New South Wales in Australia will know that they awoke to yet more deluges of rain, with levees at the point of collapse and sirens wailing.  Here at home, we have seen hurricane force winds creeping up the north Atlantic with storms racing through the letters of the alphabet.  We read worrying reports of the effects of rising oceans on our cities, including Dublin, where our D&aacute;il sits.  We have watched climate scientists scratch their heads at the simultaneous heat waves at the North and South Poles.  They should be the only poles this generation of politicians are really worried about because we are the politicians who will have to mitigate, as best we can, the impacts of climate change and the excess consumption of our generation on our children and their children.  It has gone too far to be prevented at this stage.  We are now really in mitigation mode.<\/p>  <p>  In the 1940s and 1950s, people in Ireland used to suffer and die from tuberculosis, or consumption as it was called at the time, but it is another kind of consumption that is killing this generation and our planet.  As politicians, we have to be straight with people.  As I have asked repeatedly in the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, is any government anywhere telling its people that they need to consume less stuff and use less energy given the depth and breadth of the crisis we are facing and the abrupt climate change we are seeing with parts of Europe collapsing in landslides, Canada and California going up in flames, islands in Greece being evacuated and parts of Australia going underwater with herds of cattle being swept away by floods?  I do not agree with our own Government, which puts too much onus on the individual as opposed to leading from the front and demanding institutional change on climate.<\/p>  <p>  Two years ago, before the rapid melting of ice, urgent warnings came from Oxfam that the carbon emissions of the richest 1% of people were more than double those of half of humanity, or more than 3 billion people.  We have serious work to do on these serious matters that will affect our children and their children as they live through the worst effects of destructive capitalism and all of the associated exploitation, manipulation and empty promises.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will be proposing amendments to this Bill, where appropriate, on Committee Stage.  The \"latte levy\" on a takeaway cup might sound catchy but it refers to a single-use model that is wholly unsustainable.  We are running when we should not even be standing or replenishing.  Already we use 50% of what nature can make in a year and, based on current trends, that will treble by 2050.  What way is that to live?  What example is that to give to the generations coming up?  In light of what we see in abrupt climate change, how can any continuance of this level of consumption be justified?  As the Minister of State will know, we are obsessed with growth in this country.  We really have to look at that.  <\/p>  <p>  The drafting of a waste food strategy provided for in the Bill is essential.  It is unconscionable that while half of our world is dumping food, most of the other half is starving.  It is really hard to look at the famine that is destroying Yemen and to watch little babies' and children's arms being measured, with arms only as wide as our thumbs.  While the starvation there starts with Yemen's people being starved, the conflict there has also been starved of international attention.  Our own Government appeases Saudi Arabia's Government, which has rained bombs on innocents, and God knows the untold carbon emissions that arise from those bombs.  The Saudi regime has engaged in mass decapitations and has actually butchered a journalist in one of its embassies.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  The regime is as polluting and devastating as the fossil fuels wreaking havoc on our planet, on biodiversity and on our people. <\/p>  <p>  The disposable economy, whereby cheaper items tend to be of lower quality and require frequent replacement, is also having a poor effect on society.  Inbuilt obsolescence will have to go.  The right to repair is essential.  We must have better quality goods available at a good price so that those on low incomes are not locked out of the circular economy.  My nana was not wrong when she told us that we should save up for good things because they will last.  It is very good advice if you can afford it, but it is lower-paid families who are affected because they cannot afford to buy the expensive version of an item.  We look forward to the return of the local repair shops that are such a common sight in our neighbouring countries in Europe.  We see haberdashery stores in every town and village where you can repair your vacuum cleaner, lawnmower or television.  In my own home town of Maynooth, we still have a gr&eacute;asa&iacute; so we go there to get our boots heeled and soled.<\/p>  <p>  While I broadly welcome the Bill, as a member of the Select Committee on Environment and Climate Action, I look forward to proposing amendments, which I hope the Minister of State will look on favourably.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000052#EEE00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1648657020,"counter":329,"content":"<p>The idea of circular economy and waste management is certainly not new to most people who grew up in rural Ireland.  My father worked all his life fixing farm machinery.  My brother had what was basically a scrapyard.  He took in old beaten-down cars.  Everyone who had an old banger that they wanted to keep going would come to him.  If the radiator had burst, they would get one from him.  All of the materials of the car were sent off to be recycled.  My brother now leases out that site and does not do that business any more.  The concept of all of that is something that most people will embrace and it is something they will want to do.<\/p><p>I was just thinking about how, in recent weeks, the fridge in our house started to make a lot of noise.  When I pulled it out and looked underneath, there was a little fan running beside the cooler.  One of the plastic blades had broken off and was tipping away and making a noise.  I went to <i>spares.ie<\/i>but could not get a replacement.  I tried all of the various websites before ringing a repairman who told me that because the fridge was about ten years old, I would not get a fan for it.  It is just a little bit of plastic that would not cost 10 cent to make.  The fridge is still working but it is a bit noisy.  We will put up with it for another while but the point is that the companies that manufacture goods and sell them to us have a responsibility to manufacture spare parts not just for the time it wants to, thereafter forcing you to buy a new product, but as we move into the future.  That is one thing we must ensure is put in place.  <\/p><p>Others have talked about the role of the corporate sector in all of this.  That is key.  We know that disposable cups and all of those things are a problem but the biggest producer of all of this waste is the corporate sector.  It is produced when corporations decide to cast aside a particular model of a given product and come out with a new one.  Everyone believes that a washing machine is supposed to last four or five years, at which point you throw it out and get a new one.  I saw the same thing with our own washing machine a number of years ago.  The bearing went on it and it started to make noise.  You would have thought there was an aeroplane taking off.  I talked to a repair guy and was told that you could not get the bearings any more and that you had to get the entire drum, which was as dear as a new washing machine.  What do you do in that situation but throw it out?  That is going on all of the time.  <\/p> <p>It is not just an Irish problem but a global problem and it needs to be recognised as that.  As materials like that are being dealt with, we need to ensure the corporate sector manufactures items in a way that they are fixable and people are trained to fix them.  We need to have an economy focused on that and not the other economy which is about the cast away and start again.<\/p> <p> I was glad to see the provision at the end of the Bill with regard to coal mining and hydraulic fracking of fossil fuels and gases from tight-gas sandstone reservoirs.  We had a big campaign in our part of the world, in Leitrim and West Cavan, about how bad hydraulic fracking and extracting gas in that way can be for the environment.  However, if it is bad for us to do here in Ireland, it is bad to be taking gas from any other country doing the same thing.  That point needs to be made.  We need to recognise that we are a global economy.  It is not just an economy, but a global ecology.  If something is bad here, it is bad in Pennsylvania or anywhere else.  We should not be buying into it.  We should not allow temporary problems, such as the situation in Ukraine, as extreme and horrible as it is, resulting in shortages of oil, to lead to our economy being held to ransom.<\/p> <p> While amendments and improvements to the Bill are required, it is moving in the right direction and a great deal more work needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000052#EEE00300","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648657620,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill, which Labour is glad to support.  As the Minister of State said, the Bill aims to shift Ireland's consumption patterns from a take-make-waste linear model to the more sustainable pattern of production and consumption with the aim of reducing and minimising waste and thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  It is a very welcome move.<\/p>  <p>  In a circular economy, as we know, waste and resource use are minimised and the use and value of products and materials are maintained for as long as possible so that when a product reaches the end of its life, its parts are used again and again to create further useful and productive products instead of being discarded, an all-too familiar pattern which we have been hearing about.  It is hard for many of us to fathom the quantity of waste that is produced worldwide.  Most of us probably do not like to think about waste.  Naturally it is distasteful even to reflect on the amount of waste we in our own households produce - the non-productive producing of waste.  It is hard to visualise it; it is not something we like to think about or talk about.  It is out of sight and out of mind in many cases.  However, clearly we need to address this issue of waste.  It was brought to my attention very graphically on a recent visit I made to the Covanta waste incineration plant in my constituency in the Poolbeg Peninsula.  I was confronted with literally a mountain of human-produced waste, mostly domestic but also corporate.  That was a wake-up call.  It has quite a profound effect to be confronted with the visible manifestation of our waste and our wasteful habits.  I very much welcome the Bill because it seeks to tackle that issue which we all-too often do not like to think about, talk about or even debate in political circles.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak about different aspects of the Bill that I welcome.  On the use of CCTV, in respect of section 20 of the Bill I welcome the introduction of measures to detect and deter illegal dumping and littering by empowering local authorities to use GDPR-compliant technologies to detect and prevent unsightly and illegal dumping and littering among other measures.  We in Labour support this measure first proposed by my colleague Senator Mark Wall in the Seanad, through the Local Government (Use of CCTV in Prosecution of Offences) Bill 2021 which he introduced last year with a view to addressing the difficulty local authorities have in addressing illegal dumping.<\/p>  <p>  I should say that years ago, as a practitioner in criminal defence in the District Courts, it was always quite a memorable experience to hear the local litter wardens bringing their prosecutions and giving evidence to the court of how they had to go through bags to pick out envelopes and other materials that could identify the relevant offenders so that they could bring forward the prosecutions.  It is a very cumbersome and very difficult task to prosecute in these cases.  I welcome the initiative that has been taken here.<\/p>  <p>  It is something that has been brought to our minds more because of the pandemic-related restrictions.  The travel restrictions imposed over the last couple of years have meant that many people who might have exercised in gyms or leisure centres were instead exercising outdoors locally.  It really brought home to many of us the realisation that so much environmental vandalism is caused by fly tippers and litterers in urban and rural settings alike.  In some areas illegal dumping has caused really serious erosion and other problems.  It can be found everywhere not just in remote rural areas but in the main streets of our cities and throughout our constituencies.  Cleaning up the mess comes at a cost.  It is not only creating an unsightly but in some cases hazardous environment.  Senator Wall has given me the estimate that across 31 local authorities in the State, the cost of clearing up litter and illegally dumped materials may be as much as &euro;90 million per year which is enormous.  This is without considering the enormous voluntary effort put in by community clean-up groups which operate nationwide.  I go out with my own group, the Friends of the Grand Canal, on the first Saturday every month.  I know there are also local voluntary clean-up groups across my constituency in Portobello, Kimmage, Donnybrook, Terenure, Rathgar, Sandymount, Ringsend and Irishtown.  These are volunteers who go out every week and do tremendous work, keeping their areas clean.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council and the local authorities generally, of course, also do a great deal of work.  A number of constituents in my area have been very concerned at the removal of public bins in heavy footfall areas such as beside Charlemont Luas stop thereby contributing to a resurgence of illegal dumping and littering.  We need to ensure the adequate supply of litter bins and that the councils are engaging in regular collection.  We also need to support local community groups like the ones I have mentioned, which have taken such an interest in and put in such an effort to keep local areas clean.  We are very lucky that there is such a voluntary effort going into clean-ups across the country.  It shows the need to address illegal dumping and littering, which is a serious issue.<\/p>  <p>  The aspect of the Bill that has received most focus is the reduction in single-use items at sections 11 to 14, inclusive.  There has been some good collaboration on waste measures in the past between Labour and the Green Party.  During the last D&aacute;il, there was a joint venture between my colleague Deputy Sherlock and the now MEP Grace O'Sullivan with whom I worked in the Seanad.  Deputy Sherlock and Grace O'Sullivan MEP worked together on the Bill to prohibit certain products containing plastic microbeads.  That was another important measure brought forward to address single-use items, in particular plastic, and the enormous challenge plastic waste constitutes.<\/p>  <p>  Following extensive debate and engagement with the previous Government that Government agreed to pass its own legislation to ban the manufacture or placing on the market of any water-soluble personal care cleaning product containing microplastics or microbeads.  The engagement leading to the passage of that legislation represents the sort of red-green or green-red politics that I believe in.  It is also a collaborative and constructive approach to politics, understanding the connectedness of the climate and biodiversity crises and indeed the crisis and challenges in dealing with waste.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to engage with his colleague at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to advance further regulatory measures dealing with plastic waste in particular, both at domestic and EU level because we are all conscious of the significant amount of microplastic material detected specifically in marine life.  The logical natural progression of banning these toxic microplastics is that we would now seek to phase out single-use plastics altogether.  The Minister of State referred to the levy that was imposed on plastic bags which was controversial when it was first introduced.  Because it has now become so embedded in our national culture, we often forget that the topic actually dominated phone-in talk-radio shows for weeks at the time it was sought to be introduced, as indeed did the introduction of smoke-free areas and so on.  We then adjust and move on, recognising the enormous benefit to us all, our society and our country that these measures represent.<\/p>  <p>  Now that society has adjusted to the plastic bag levy, we all bring our own shopping bags to supermarkets without even thinking twice.  Similarly, we need to move to a situation where we regard it as natural that we have phased out single-use plastic.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the coverage of the Bill on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning.  Those interviewed in vox pops were shocked to learn that about 200 million disposable coffee cups are sent to landfill or incineration every year.<\/p> <p>Again reflecting on my experience of visiting the Covanta site, we saw a huge amount of single-use coffee cups in that mountain of waste sent to be incinerated and a huge volume of other recyclable materials.  While we have had very strong uptake of recycling and very positive figures on increased use of recycling and of green bins, there is still too much recyclable material going into incineration, which is something we need to address.<br\/><br\/>It is, of course, positive to see the move away from landfill, which the Minister of State addressed, and I have certainly seen those impressive statistics.  However, we need to do more to develop the potential in the waste to energy sector, for example, through the rolling out of district heating systems, which, again, in my own area have been promised for a long time for Ringsend.  I see the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, looking somewhat rueful about this.  It is an issue on which there has been far too much delay.  We need to see this moved on as a matter of urgency.  Other European countries have well established waste to energy programmes.  District heating is the obvious use of waste to energy.  It an obvious application where waste to energy can really make a huge difference and can really improve people's quality of life and address issues around the very concerning rises in fuel and energy costs.<br\/><br\/>It is very positive, therefore, to see these measures brought into the Bill around single-use items, disposable coffee cups in particular, on which there has been a real focus.  To be very local for a moment, it is very welcome to see signs up in the canteen in Leinster House suggesting people use their own cup rather than taking a disposable one to the coffee machine.  We have a responsibility to lead by example.  I never miss the opportunity to say that one area where we have really failed to lead by example here in Leinster House is on encouragement of cycling.  As the co-convenor with Senator Garvey of the Oireachtas cyclists group, we have been pushing for many years to try to get decent bike parking facilities in Leinster House.  It is something I will again be in contact with the Minister of State about because we need to be seen to encourage more Oireachtas Members and staff to cycle to work.  We are not sending out a signal that we are a welcoming space for cyclists with the very poor provision of bike parking facilities and with absolutely no covered bike parking facilities, while cars are parked everywhere, often on the lawn at the back of Leinster House.  This is where we need to be leading by example, as we are on encouraging the use of keep cups or people's own cups.<br\/><br\/>I want to move to another point on which this Bill could do more or where we may need to see additional legislation, and that is on the right to repair.  While this Bill, in a very welcome way, will assist in shifting behaviour among producers and the general population, we also need to do more to shift the balance of power from manufacturers and corporations back to citizens and ordinary people.  It is often difficult to make sustainable choices.  We heard Deputy Martin Kenny speak about the difficulties with repairing products that break down and the fact that, in too many cases, those products are simply disposed of and new products are purchased.  This relatively new concept of a right to repair is one we need to see enshrined in law.  It would make a huge difference in reducing waste while also addressing a power imbalance between consumers and manufacturers, and putting more money in people&rsquo;s pockets.<br\/><br\/>In March 2020, the European Commission adopted its new circular economy action plan, which aims to establish a strong and coherent product policy framework to transform European consumption patterns and to avoid the production of waste in the first place.  As part of this process, the Commission looks to embed a right to repair in EU consumer and product policies.  This sort of legislation was strongly recommended, I note, by several of the submissions to the public consultation underpinning this Bill.  It is an important part of a circular economy plan.  The idea of right to repair was also echoed in debates which have taken place in the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action over recent months.  This Bill could do more on the issue.<br\/><br\/>I have already drafted a Labour Party Bill to enshrine a right to repair.I should say it was inspired by the writing of Karlin Lillington in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, speaking about how the right to repair has taken on a very strong force in US politics and US environmental activism and we have seen this coming forward.  This legislation would include measures to stop waste and tackle the cost of living by requiring manufacturers, particularly of digital and electronic equipment, to make available repair information to consumers and to break the monopoly on repair by the manufacturer.  The legislation is urgently needed, not just to tackle corporate power and power imbalance and to break that monopoly, but also to crack down on what we might call planned obsolescence, that business strategy where the obsolescence of a product is built into it from its conception by the manufacturer to the point where we all think a washing machine should only have a few years lifespan.  It is, of course, done with a view to compelling consumers or creating a culture in which consumers feel compelled to continue to invest in more and more new products.  We are calling for a comprehensive right to repair to be enshrined in legislation to empower consumers and to create a market for repairable products and repair services.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious that, as is the case with many of us, my area of Dublin 8 has a number of small local phone shops where people can bring their smartphone or whatever make of mobile phone they have if the screen has cracked &ndash; in a household with teenagers, there are often many incidents of phone screens being cracked.  The small local shop will fix the phone screen, usually in a matter of minutes, but, of course, if that is done, it generally means the phone is no longer guaranteed by the manufacturer because the manufacturer has retained the monopoly of repair.  That is exactly the sort of practice which right to repair legislation seeks to tackle.<br\/><br\/>I believe it should be an important component of any circular economy legislation to enshrine that right to repair, to re-empower consumers and to break that cycle of obsolescence which generates so much waste and which will continue to do so unless we tackle it.  We must go beyond the current EU directives and EU measures and extend that right to include not just digital electronic equipment, albeit that is a very important area, but also to include smaller household devices and to empower consumers generally.  In the spirit of our previous engagement with the Government on the CCTV issue and on the prohibition of microbeads, I would hope the Minister of State will work with me and my party colleagues to see this principle placed on a legislative footing.<br\/><br\/>More generally, we very much welcome the concept of a circular economy.  We in the Labour Party have put forward the important concept that national economic planning and climate targets must be in sync because they are two sides of the same coin.  We need to ensure that any economic strategy takes account of and builds in environmental strategy and regional job generation to ensure we become the renewable superpower that we can be, and to break the hold of fossil fuel oligarchs and magnates, which I know is very much in all of our minds at present.<br\/><br\/>It would also, of course, ensure that climate would be at the heart of government.  While the Green Party clearly has a very strong commitment on climate action, the offices of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform are held by the other two Government parties, so we need to see that cross-party and cross-government strategising on the economy and on the environment together.<br\/><br\/>I want to mention Part 5 of the Bill, which is very important.  It will end the issuing of new licences for exploration and mining of coal, lignite and oil shale, a welcome and important component of the move to consolidate a policy of reducing reliance on fossil fuels.  Again, this is a topic that many of us have been speaking about.  I expressed yesterday to the Taoiseach my wish that we need to take every step to avoid the horrific war in Ukraine having consequences on climate targets and environmental action.  However, it may well do, because we are certainly seeing this horrific war, this brutal invasion of Ukraine, having enormous knock-on effects on food security, fuel and energy security and the cost of living for all of us, not just in Ireland but across the world and, in particular, in developing countries that were so reliant on Ukrainian wheat imports as much as anything.  We know the war has already had enormous consequences.  It may pose a threat to the limited but hard-fought for gains achieved at COP26 last year and it may pose obstacles to the reaching of our own climate targets.  However, we also know that the consequences of failing to keep global temperatures below 1.5&deg;C this century will be catastrophic and that any further slippage could have unthinkable results for humanity as we face this existential crisis.  All of us are conscious of our fortune in being able to stand here in a peaceful corner of Europe to debate climate issues as the war rages in Ukraine and as people in Mariupol, Kyiv and elsewhere endure horrific bombardment but, undoubtedly, the climate crisis is that existential crisis that confronts us all and that we need to take more urgent action on.<br\/><br\/>I very much welcome the Bill.  I would like to see more on the right to repair and I hope to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage on that topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000053#FFF00200","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648658820,"counter":333,"content":"<p>On the previous Deputy's point about Covanta, I remember in the last D&aacute;il as Dublin spokesperson going down to the Irish Water sewage treatment plant.

A study published in the journal <i>Environment International<\/i>tested 22 anonymous blood samples and found plastic particles in 80% of people tested, indicating such particles may be able to travel round the body and lodge in organs.<\/p><p>Politics owes the Green Party and the green movement a great debt in terms of highlighting and bringing the need for climate action to the fore.  I feel comfortable saying it is now a mainstream topic.  The Green Party is particularly good at the legislative and macro pieces but is not as radical as I would like to be in terms of micro measures implemented on the ground.  If it is proved that microparticles from plastic bottles are found in the human body, why do we not just ban them?  Here is a practical solution.  Given all the plastic bottled water for sale in our shops, why do we not encourage the big water bottling companies to supply substantial water fonts to these supermarkets and let me bring my glass bottle or three glass bottles and fill them up every time I shop?  If I want to purchase, why must I purchase plastic all the time?<\/p><p>This is serious.  We are bringing in a tax on plastic cups.  Why not ban them?  If people want coffee, let us bring our own cups.  The best way to do that is ban the sale of these.  That leads to another issue.  Everybody buys coffee now, including me.  When you go into the shop, it is not just the cups.  You have the slim, little wooden paddle sticks, which get used once and are thrown into waste.  They are never recycled.  There are the coffee grains.  They get thrown in the same bag.  There are fast food companies that I will not name which offer the grains to customers free of charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000055#HHH00100","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1648658820,"counter":334,"content":"<p>They are great in the garden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000055#HHH00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1648658820,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Yes.  Even there a bit of education is needed because apparently they are not great in every aspect of the garden but are suitable for particular plants.<\/p>  <p>  Sometimes I think we are too late.  A piecemeal manner of addressing this will not work.  If you want to see the appetite for plastic, go into your supermarket.  The most obscene example of plastic use is on airlines.  When you order a cup of tea and a bun, you are given a plastic cup, a plastic spoon, plastic sachets of sugar, a plastic holder for the milk, plastic around the bag, a plastic bag to dispose of the plastic to be collected and that is disposed of in another plastic bag that the cabin crew push around.  The amount of plastic peddled to consumers on airlines is obscene.  <\/p>  <p>  I have a Bill that is almost completed and has been in gestation for quite a while.  It is around waste recycling.  I hope to publish it after Easter.  It proposes to build on the voluntary efforts made by some supermarkets.  I do not want to name them.  They have large bays in the supermarket so people can dispose of unwanted plastic before bringing their shopping home.  Some supermarkets and supermarket chains are taking big steps forward in relation to this.  I was talking to someone from a new supermarket in my area and they are going to great lengths to restrict the amount of waste.  We need to go a step further.  My Bill intends to make this mandatory in supermarkets and shops of a particular size.  Some of the legislation governing rehab talks about this.  I should be able to dispose of unwanted wrapping, containers, covers or whatever in the shop.  A classic example, in terms of paper, is the load of newspaper supplements which I do not want when I buy the newspaper and would like to be able to leave behind.  Supermarkets are stopping at this phase; they are clapping themselves on the back and saying they are enabling people to leave wrappings and produce covers behind.  I would like them to be able to examine whether packaging on some goods is left behind by customers in much bigger volumes than packaging on other goods.  They should be able to contact manufacturers to say that customers do not seem to like the way they package their goods.  That is the only way to create a chain of change.  That Bill is coming forward after Easter.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State should not be afraid to be radical.  There is a huge appetite among the public.  Plastic bottles will kill us all.  They are killing marine life and ocean life.  There is some evidence, which I am sure will grow and grow, that we are digesting it into our system.  There is plastic in our system and God knows what damage that is doing to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000055#HHH00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1648658820,"counter":336,"content":"<p>There are some important elements to the Bill which I welcome.  Overall, we welcome the Bill.  We will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The provision to use CCTV in some circumstances to catch illegal dumping is welcome.  It will be welcomed in many flat complexes around my constituency.  Residents in the likes of Bishop Street, not too far from here, are scourged by people throwing rubbish in the bin storage areas and making them unsafe and unhealthy.  That leads to rats and seagulls making the bin areas a particularly disgusting space in many flat complexes.  These areas need to be designed and managed much better than they are.<\/p>  <p>  The Rathmines flats bin storage area and the Glovers Court bin storage area, again not far from here, are unhealthy and unsafe.  Residents are afraid to open the lid of the bin container because they are not sure what will scurry out, so bags are not always thrown into the bin container but are left there.  This highlights the need for local authorities to design bin storage areas to a higher standard.<\/p>  <p>  It was reported to me recently that a van regularly comes into the bin storage area in Countess Markiewicz House on the other side of the city and dumps bags.  They leave very little room for residents to dump their rubbish safely, cleanly and effectively.  It is welcome that CCTV and drones will be able to be used for prosecutions.  In the inner city and the flat complexes it is important.  I hope local authorities will be able to use CCTV and the Bill will make that applicable for sites like Countess Markiewicz House and the flat complexes.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Lahart mentioned the excessive use of plastic packaging.  We all wonder why so much of it is used.  Many products are wrapped, double-wrapped or triple-wrapped.  <\/p> <p>We all need to challenge ourselves.  Like Deputy Lahart, I leave plastic and packaging behind in shops.  In fairness, the shops I go into and where I leave the packaging behind are very accommodating.  It is welcome that the Minister will be able to target this type of packaging.  We must reduce what we are sending to the incinerator, which of course is a blight that was foisted on the community of Ringsend.  If we can reduce the packaging and waste going to the incinerator, this will be good legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000055#HHH00400","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648659420,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I welcome the discussion of this Bill, which we in the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action reported on in the context of pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation in June 2021.  The report was subsequently published in December 2021.  We met many stakeholders who provided evidence from a broad range of perspectives, including representatives of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, VOICE Ireland, the European Environmental Bureau, EEB, and CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE.  The backdrop to this new policy is the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which outlines Ireland's transition to net zero and achieving a climate-neutral economy not later than 2050.  It also puts on a statutory footing the circular economy strategy, the circular economy programme and the national food waste prevention roadmap, which will focus on reducing food waste by 50% by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  We live in a linear economy, where raw materials are collected, often to the detriment of developing nations, then transformed into products that are used until they are finally discarded as waste.  Value is created in this economic system by producing and selling as many products as possible.  This leads to the take, make and disposal of consumerist culture in which we all partake.  Deputy O'Rourke is correct that this legislation is a backward-facing policy instead of a forward-facing policy.  This is how we used to live some 30, 40 and 50 years ago and we must reflect on the values we had in those days, because we might learn a great deal from the many people who still practice that more frugal lifestyle.  <\/p>  <p>  Two reports from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, last year pointed to a worrying trend in the way we are dealing with our waste.  The first, released in September 2021, showed that 69% of Ireland's plastic waste is burned instead of being recycled, which is sending additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  A second report on waste published by the EPA in December 2021 found that while waste was rising to record levels, recycling rates were falling and Ireland was over-reliant on incineration to tackle our waste.  Furthermore, in 2019, almost half of our rubbish was burned, and that was up from just 4% in 2009.  The EPA said at the time that systemic change was needed to shift the focus to designing out waste and promoting reuse and recycling.<\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful that with this Bill we will see the shift we need to help us reach our emissions reductions targets as well to help us move towards a more sustainable and fairer economic system.  In a circular economy, waste is minimised and products are kept in use for as long as possible through design, repair and reuse.  When a product reaches the end of its life, its parts are used repeatedly to create further useful products, hence the circular nature of resources and products.  It is to be hoped this Bill will be a turning point that brings us away from a linear economy and towards a circular one.  It is intended to put Ireland on a path towards a circular economy by placing the circular economy strategy, the circular economy programme and the national food waste prevention roadmap on a statutory footing.  It will also introduce levies and bans on certain single-use items, while using CCTV to deter dumping and littering.<\/p>  <p>  What I wish to focus on concerning this Bill are the changes made since pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, of which I am a member.  I also wish to touch briefly on timelines and targets.  Most importantly, though, I wish to spend most of my time discussing how to make this legislation, and other climate action policies, poverty- and disability-proof.  This should be a key focus of the Government in respect of legislation and policies of this type.  The Bill has marginally improved since the pre-legislative stage, and has incorporated some of the recommendations made by the joint committee.  The Minister of State will be discussing this aspect in his closing statement as well.<\/p>  <p>  The improvements made include some definitions, such as the meaning of \"circular economy\", which identify each stage of the supply chain and the need to minimise the harmful impact each stage has on the environment.  Clarifying that the term \"recovery activities\" does not include incineration is also welcome.  Equally, it is welcome that the annual reporting process under the circular economy plan will now be done in tandem with the climate action plan and through a statutory instrument.  I also welcome clarification from the Department that the existing list of environmental levies is indicative and that it can be extended to include single-use items such as wet wipes, hotel toiletries, sugar and condiments.<\/p>  <p>  It has been highlighted, however, by the Department that this legislation only deals with food packaging and that other items must be dealt with separately in the Department and in the EU.  A significant public awareness campaign will be implemented on foot of the enactment of this Bill, and this is welcome and was another key recommendation of the joint committee.  Unfortunately, the Bill has some shortcomings.  Many of our recommendations have been deferred for consideration by the circular economy interdepartmental committee, which is to be established after the legislation is enacted.  These include measures such as VAT relief for refurbished and repaired items, insurance and liability for those working in the repair and reuse sector, harmonisation of civic amenities sites, with co-location and co-operation, such as with men's sheds, the addressing of the challenges of planning, obsolescence, renewal, wider development of traditional and heritage crafts, skills and practices and measures the construction sector could take to reduce waste.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the last point, there is a hesitancy from the Department to increase costs on quarries to incentivise the recovery and recycling of construction industry waste, as this could increase construction costs.  In addition to those limitations, I also have some concerns about the language used throughout the Bill.  The word \"may\" is used instead of \"shall\" in many locations in respect of the Minister's powers to impose levies, bans and regulations.  The Bill does not specify where funding from the levies will go in respect of the environment fund.  I will be seeking to amend this legislation on later Stages to strengthen the language used to ensure it is robust and has the full backing of the law.  This was an issue with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 when it first came through the House as well.  I refer to this sort of looseness of language.  It does not bring the clarity and strength required by legislation and I would like to see work done on this aspect.<\/p>  <p>  A key criticism of the heads of the Bill was the lack of any concrete timelines or targets.  I must acknowledge that the Bill has improved in this regard.  For example, there is now a timeline for the circular economy strategy to be completed within six months of the commencement of the strategy and not less than once every three years thereafter.  The Government has indicated that a six-year timeframe is appropriate for the circular economy programme.  The joint committee also requested that numerical targets for sectors to move towards the circular economy be included in the final text of the Bill and I am happy to see that was provided for in section 7(6).  These targets will now be included in the circular economy strategy, as provided for in legislation.<\/p>  <p>  While these improvements are welcome, many of these proposals are to be etched out in the circular economy strategy itself.  This means that much of the target reporting and target ranges will not be contained in primary legislation, which means they will not have the full backing of the law.  This could compromise our ability to ensure sectors are held to account and adhere to Government strategy in this regard.  Overall, much improvement can be done to make this an integral part of our climate action objectives and to help us to achieve our national and international objectives in this regard.  I will submit amendments to that effect when the Bill moves to Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>  <p>  I turn now to the important issue of poverty-proofing this legislation.  In recommendation No. 62, the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action suggested that consideration be given to environmental and human rights considerations in the devising of circular economy action plans.  I believe this applies to the international and domestic context.  Internationally, the success of the circular economy in developing countries will be critical to global efforts to ensure sustainable growth and the meeting of our collective climate action goals.  Human rights, economic inclusion and social equity must all play a central role in circular initiatives at home and abroad.<\/p>  <p>  Domestically, we must ensure the rights of those on low or fixed incomes to participate fully in economic life are protected, enhanced and enforced in a new circular economy model.  Hence poverty- and disability-proofing should be an integral pillar in the development of a circular economy.  What is being proposed here, if implemented, would bring positive change for our environment and help us to reach our climate action goals.  We must, though, ensure this new model does not negatively impact those on low or fixed incomes or on those with disabilities.  As we transition to a zero-carbon economy, we must ensure we leave no one behind and that the transition is a fair and just one.  What NGOs have persistently advocated for when we make this transition to a zero-carbon economy is that people on low incomes must be able to afford their minimum energy needs.  In the context of a circular economy, we must also ensure the same is applied to food and essential goods and services.  That is why I call for this Bill and the circular economy strategy to be poverty- and disability-proofed.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p> What does this mean, exactly?  Poverty-proofing is the process by which Departments, local authorities and State agencies assess policies and programmes at design and review stages on the likely impact they will have or have had on poverty or inequalities likely to lead to poverty with a view to poverty reduction.  In the context of rising energy costs and inflation, we must be cognisant of the real daily struggles of people we are dealing with.  I, and I am sure every Member in this D&aacute;il, have been contacted by people who are really struggling now with the cost of living, including fuel.  These are costs that people could have managed last year or the year before, but with both global and domestic issues, they are finding it very difficult now.<\/p> <p> I had one constituent who contacted me who is a cancer patient who had to give up work, so he is now on a disability payment.  He received a large electricity bill, and because he paid that bill, he did not have enough money for food.  This many also has type 1 diabetes and he ended up in hospital after becoming hyperglycaemic as a result of unstable blood sugar.  That is the type of case many people are experiencing.  That constituent contacted my office and it is the reality for people that they are unable to pay their heating bills and are resorting to eating less or cheaper and less nutritious food.  Children are bearing the brunt of this upheaval, and with inflation continuing to rise, so will poverty rates.  Poverty-proofing and disability-proofing Government policies will become more important than ever as a result.<\/p> <p> This can be done in a number of ways.  In section 7(5), there is a list of strategies and national plans to which the circular economy strategy must have regard.  However, there is no reference to poverty reduction strategies, including the forthcoming strategy to combat energy poverty.  I hope the Government can include a reference to such a strategy in that section once it is published.<\/p> <p>We are at an impasse with respect to the crucial policies that will affect people with disabilities and people on low and fixed incomes now.  Ireland still has no relative poverty target, although the Government's Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 states that a key aim is to reduce the level of consistent poverty to 2% or less, with an associated goal to reduce child poverty in Ireland and ensure all families have the opportunity to participate fully in society.  We are also waiting on the review to be completed on the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, which should feed into this legislation and the circular economy strategy.  The new strategy is not ready for inclusion in this legislation but there may be room to include the current iteration, even if it is out of date.<\/p> <p> The Europe 2020 strategy set an EU target to reduce poverty by at least 20 million people by 2020.  The poverty target was crucial as it kept poverty high on the EU agenda.  However, there was a failure to reduce poverty by more than 8 million people, following an increase to 123 million people being in poverty during the 2008 crisis.  The Commission is currently considering proposals for an EU poverty target for the next decade, but we must still reference the existing target in legislation.  Section 7 includes a reference to the United Nations sustainable development goals, but the EU is only on track to meet 26, or 15% of the 169 targets for those goals.  That is very concerning.<\/p> <p> In the meantime and while we wait for ongoing developments in the national poverty and disability strategies, we could include in the current Bill consideration of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, which includes poverty targets.  This is a live document and it would help assess the circular economy strategy against the targets in this roadmap.<\/p> <p> A waste prevention strategy was launched by a Minister a number of years ago without consultation with organisations dealing with or supporting those at risk of or living in poverty.  There was no consultation with disability groups, who deal with people on the ground, in the drafting of that policy.  There were 36 groups consulted on the document, ranging broadly from the Restaurants Association of Ireland to the Soil Recovery Association.  Unfortunately, there was a major gap when it came to those living with disabilities or at risk of poverty.  This is something on which we must absolutely keep a focus.<\/p> <p> It is not just about poverty-proofing.  This circular economy Bill should also play a role in alleviating poverty by addressing the structural inequalities inherent in a linear economic model.  The aim should be to support social enterprises in Ireland that provide support and employment for those living in poverty, ensuring they are more involved with the circular economy and that the circular economy products are cheaper than existing products.  That would have a positive impact on those on low incomes.  There is much potential in this Bill if we get it right.  I know Oxfam Ireland has done a great deal of work on the poverty alleviation mechanisms within a circular economy and I recommend the Minister meet its representatives, although he may already have had those discussions.  This is very relevant as products currently on the market aimed at reducing waste are really out of reach for most people.  It is great we are seeing zero waste shops but they tend to be much more expensive.  There should be a focus from the Government on supporting such enterprise, making them the norm rather than the novelty.  During the transition we must ensure cost is not prohibitive for people on low incomes while at the same time investing in sectors to create sustainable employment accessible to all.<\/p> <p> The environment fund has already been set up to collect the plastic bag levies and it could be expanded to include the funding of more groups using revenue generated from further levies as part of the circular economy strategy.  Section 8 describes a list of sectors that can apply for funding, but it is short on any reference to organisations that aim to reduce energy poverty or the impacts the circular economy could have on people living with disability or illness, such as the man with cancer I mentioned earlier.  If we are talking about poverty-proofing and ensuring there is a fair and just transition, we should use this circular economy Bill to focus on those people, and such groups should be included in the list of those who could benefit from the levies.  That would ensure payments are being directed to the right areas and people.<\/p> <p> People at risk of poverty or with disabilities must be treated as active participants in the new economy rather than being relegated to inactive participants, as they are with the current linear economic model we have today.  I recommend the circular economy interdepartmental committee, referred to by the Government as the group that will look further into some of our committee's recommendations, should also include the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and the Ministers with responsibility for children and justice.  These are the portfolios that cover poverty.<\/p> <p> Without proper consultation on our climate action policies, we risk accelerating poverty and further disadvantaging people with disabilities.  There will be an opportunity to engage later in the legislative process but it is important their voices and concerns should feed into policy processes at initial stages.  Consultation should be active, early and thorough to make people feel they have been involved and to give the best possible result.<\/p> <p> It is crucial to include a review clause in this Bill and I hope to bring it as an amendment when the legislation progresses through the House.  This would include a review to be carried out in conjunction with poverty and disability advocacy groups to see how the Bill affects those with lower or fixed incomes and to assess whether the drafting of the circular economy strategy, the levies applied and the national food waste programme take into account the needs of those most vulnerable to transition and change.  That is a key element to monitor in the progress of this Bill and its effect.<\/p> <p> With regard to food poverty, we must be cognisant of affordability in the context of the rising cost of living.  I understand there is an opportunity to address pricing of food products in the agriculture and food supply chain Bill that would establish a new authority called the national food ombudsman to enforce the unfair trading practices directive and to have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.  We might use this as another tool to help address food poverty and I call on various Ministers to ensure advocacy groups are adequately consulted in this process and on the full range of climate action policies in future.<\/p> <p> The idea of a circular economy in the current economic context is positive but we must also be cognisant of and focused on how this new economy will treat people, particularly those who are most vulnerable in our society.  It is a question of whether we include them or view them as passive actors during the course of this transition.  We have an opportunity to change this by adopting a more holistic transitional approach for people in poverty or with a disability, recognising the opportunity to drive social change along with climate action.<\/p> <p>As I do more work in this area and get older, I am developing a more holistic view across society.  I originally would have been very much environmentally focused.  That was my background and my area.  I am now starting to see that we cannot separate the environment from how we live.  We cannot separate it from every single element that impacts on people, including food costs, fuel costs and travel.  It is so cross-cutting.  Our responses and the legislation and policies we develop have to take into account all those other sectors.  We cannot just look at it as an environmental Bill whereby if we cut plastics out of the environment, we will not have plastics in our water.  We need to look at it through all the lenses required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648660620,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I welcome this discussion.  The Bill flips on its head the whole idea of take, make and waste.  There is great waste in this country day in and day out.  Some of the changes proposed in the Bill could see an annual saving of &euro;2.3 billion if people just changed the way they function.  I was listening to a Deputy talk about a new motorway from Cork to Limerick.  That money would build most of that motorway and probably a bit extra as well.  That puts perspective on the annual waste of some of the bad environmental habits we have come to accept as norms.<\/p><p>The idea of reducing disposable coffee cups is a very good one and I welcome the sanctions in that regard, along the lines of the plastic bag levy which was introduced in the late 1990s with great success.  Every town and village also has its takeaway and a lot of foil trays and plastic tubs come out of them.  People can recycle them at home if they are willing to throw them into sink, scrub them down and dry them before they go into the bin.  Most people fling them straight into the bin.  Far too often these tubs are chucked out the window of a car at the local beauty spot after someone has stopped off to have their picnic on their way home from the chipper.  There are elements that legislation needs to go after.  It is not just all plastic bags and coffee cups.  The proliferation of littering takes other forms that we need to tackle as well.<\/p><p>I am enthused to see the Bill finally deal with CCTV and its use in combating illegal dumping.  Sections 20 to 23, inclusive, tackle the whole area of GDPR and the provisions allow people to start using cameras in a smart way to detect illegal littering and secure prosecution.  That is the only way we are going to get to a head on this.  I am chairman of a local environmental group, the Woodcock Hill enhancement committee.  For the last two years we have been told repeatedly by legal professionals and Clare County Council that we cannot use cameras.  I have asked senior local members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if they would refuse to act should we detect an act of littering or a crime and pass footage over to them.  They said there was no way they would refuse and that they would gladly take it into a court and test it legally.  There has been no test case for this.<\/p><p>I do not believe the GDPR barrier that we are told is prohibiting us from using CCTV exists in real terms.  This is some fandangled idea that legal experts have drawn up.  I am repeatedly told by people in the legal profession and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they will not turn away CCTV footage that is presented to them and is of high quality.  In the realm of criminal law in recent years we have seen CCTV camera footage welcomed with open arms in our courts system.  I am not convinced it has been a barrier in the last two or three years.  We seem to have an interpretation of GDPR in Ireland that is not fully congruent with those of other European nations.  I do not get that.<\/p><p>To go on a slight tangent, on all the regulations relating to hedge cutting, I have seen every summer when I go abroad to continental Europe, which is governed by the same EU environmental legislation as us, that people there seem to be able to cut hedgerows while we cannot do so.  They seem to be able to use CCTV cameras yet we cannot.  I think sometimes there is a skewed interpretation in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in the body legal and the body politic, that cannot take very sensible regulations from Europe and implement them in a simpler way.  We were facing the possibility of going to court and trying to prove this in a test case.  I am glad it can now be done.<\/p><p>I will tell the House what we use in the Woodcock Hill enhancement committee.  We use a trail camera purchased in Lidl.  I think it cost us &euro;80.  It has a little battery pack on the back.  We strap it onto a tree.  We know where the litter is always dumped.  The batteries last for three or four months.  There is a SIM card in it so when a car passes and the boot pops open, I get a message with the photo and video footage.  I can see who is dumping and sometimes it is very interesting.  Sometimes it is the people we would least expect to be doing so.  I would love to abuse D&aacute;il privilege and name them all out but I will not.  I do not want to raise blood pressure here tonight but it is very interesting to see who is dumping.  We like to profile them in our head and say it is that guy or that woman but it is often very surprising.  It is often the person down the road holding down a top career who is chucking stuff out of the boot on a Monday morning on their way to work.  They probably know who they are if they are watching this debate.  We do not always need to use D&aacute;il privilege.  Sometimes what is unsaid is understood in a home environment.<\/p><p>Other forms of enforcement also need to be looked at.  We have three litter enforcement officers in County Clare, I think, although we have 800 council staff.  I am not diminishing their roles; they all do important jobs.  I know what some of them do and I do not know what others do.  There are 800 people working for Clare County Council and three of them are working in the domain of litter and waste enforcement.  That is wrong.  They are under capacity.  They do a fantastic job but, by God, how can they tackle a problem when they are that under-resourced?<\/p><p>There are other areas of pollution they cannot go next nor near, for example, noise and air pollution.  On 22 January, Ennis town, with a population of 25,000, had air quality worse than Beijing, a city of 21 million people.  That says a lot.  There is no capacity to go after that.  It just gets a headline in<i>The Clare Champion<\/i>or is mentioned on Clare FM.  There is no great follow-up because we do not have the capacity to enforce regulations on noise, air and all the other forms of pollution.  We seem to be good at tackling litter waste because it is visible and we take it away and deal with it.  We do not have sufficient capacity yet in Ireland to deal with those other forms of pollution.<\/p><p>On wheelie bins, I checked before coming in to the Chamber and &euro;306 is what a national wheelie bin provider is quoting for a 12-month contract.  Surely, in 2022, we could make wheelie bins mandatory.  There are a lot of people bringing out a little bag and burning it in the back garden by night so the smoke is not seen in the dark.  There are people stuffing little bags into bins as they walk down the street.  Surely we can do that.  We are charging people a lot of money on USC and local property tax.  Surely a little bit could be given back to people.<\/p><p>On bins in train stations, I took the train here this morning.  In Limerick train station there are recycling and waste bins side by side.  I come up to Dublin having had my sandwich and my bottle of Ballygowan and there are no bins.  When I do find them they are waste only.  It is a simple thing.  They should be side by side wherever we go.<\/p><p>On naming and shaming, when I began as a councillor, and I think many Deputies have served on local authorities, the back pages of the council agenda booklet were always printed in pink.  We all flicked through them because they listed everyone convicted for a litter fine.  That disappeared in the last few years because GDPR said we could not do it.  That is codswallop.  I think we can and we need to get back to doing it.  There is nothing like peer enforcement and seeing that Mary and Joe down the road dumped litter out of their car on Saturday and were fined &euro;150.  It is great.  It teaches them a lesson they will never forget.  We need to get back to publishing that information and let newspapers have a field day.  This should be a little feature on page 2 or 3 of <i>The Clare Champion<\/i>every week.  Let us name and shame them.  I think legislation can do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000058#LLL00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1648660620,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I welcome the legislation, which is long overdue.  I brought forward a Bill in a previous D&aacute;il in respect of return and reuse of waste.  It is important that we have fairness in a just transition.  That needs to be at the heart of climate action.  Citizens need to play their part but we must also get big business and large multinationals to do their bit.  We have to move away from the throwaway culture of single-use plastic.  Of course we want people to change their habits and use less plastic.  However, large companies continue to package stuff in plastic.  I am sure the Minister sees it in supermarkets.  Products are in plastic trays.  We need to ban them.  We do not need plastic trays any more.  We know that.  We can do the weekly shopping without bringing home ten or 15 of these plastic trays that all have to be disposed of.  If they go into the recycling bin, they might wind up in India in a furnace somewhere or in China, having to be shipped halfway around the world.  We need to stop it at source.  Reuse is okay but it is only second best.  Cutting off the source of the waste needs to be the priority.  We need to move away from the situation where we have that in supermarkets.  There is also a cost to the packaging which is passed on to the customer.  If I am buying vegetables that are in plastic wrappers, I can be sure the cost of the wrappers is added on to the purchase price.  We need to stop it at source.<\/p>  <p>  Our semi-State companies need to be at the heart of this.  I am appealing to the Minister as a Dublin Deputy to look out at this.  Bord na M&oacute;na is already involved in recycling and the circular economy.<\/p> <p>It is operating major waste facility plants, one dealing with tyres and another dealing with household waste.  It has really geared up in this area.  We need to address this in such a way that we are not reinventing the wheel.  We need individual action and action by companies to cut off waste at source.  I welcome the circular economy but if we can cut of waste at source, it is better.<\/p> <p> I very much welcome the provisions on CCTV.  This is an issue I have raised on many occasions.  I concur with previous speakers.  It is a pain in the head that we cannot use CCTV.  It was being used very effectively in County Laois.  Small cameras strapped to a bush or a tree were catching people littering.  GDPR has gone crazy and we need to stop that.  I do not know where the current interpretation of the regulation comes from but we are overusing GDPR and it is being used as an excuse sometimes.  We need to use CCTV.  I ask the Minister to progress the Bill quickly so that we can accelerate these provisions and get mobile CCTV back in action at black spots.<\/p> <p> We need to watch out that whatever action we take does not put people further into poverty.  We must ensure we reward low and middle-income households in particular.  We can do that through deposit return, for example.  Let us move to using glass bottles.  The page in my hand is A4 size.  Why cannot we have standard bottles?  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will remember, as I do, when we used glass bottles which could be washed and reused repeatedly.  People were paid to return them.  Let us get away from plastic and remove it from society, in as far as we can, and try to reward people for good environmental habits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000058#LLL00300","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648661220,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I call People Before Profit.

As somebody who cares about the environment and recognises that 70% of all the marine litter in the European Union is accounted for by only ten of the most commonly found single-use plastic items, I can really appreciate where this Bill is coming from.<\/p><p>The last time we took action on banning plastics, which was about a year ago, it was to ban all plastic cutlery.  <i>Voil&agrave;<\/i>, I have here exhibit A.  The little plastic fork I hold in my hand is sold in this House along with fruit.  I thought we had banned plastic cutlery.  A lot of stuff goes under the radar.  I am not the big police chief of plastic but I am passionately concerned that we produce and use far too much of it.  My party welcomed this Bill with great excitement.  We thought it was great to have a circular economy Bill and wanted to see what it would do in terms of the environment.  However, it does not tackle the real polluters, namely, the fossil fuel and plastic industries which make and produce plastics and make the greatest profits from them.  That is a real shame.  It is a habit the Green Party, in particular, is in danger of repeating.<\/p><p>Aside from the interlinked issue of the climate crisis, I can think of no more important issue that we could deal with.  It goes to the heart of dealing with our environmental crisis, but also with how we deal with the planet's finite resources, which are being exploited and overused in a massive way.  The way we constantly produce, reproduce and push economies to have more and more products is not sustainable.  As the basis of the capitalist system under which we live, we will have to think about that system and ways of challenging it.  For this reason, in this modern capitalist society where there is overfishing, exploitation of marine life, depletion of natural resources and minerals, overuse of fresh water, disruption to the global hydrological cycle, burning of carbon and fossil fuels regardless of the consequences, and the destruction of rare earth minerals, forestry, etc., we need a strong and robust Bill that addresses all of that.  Such a Bill would tackle the planned obsolescence inherent in many of the global production and supply networks.  It would fund and enshrine the right to repair and ban the use of damaging chemicals in production.  It would support locally-grown and healthy food production.  It would regulate, ban and restrict the exploitation of our finite resources.  To do that in a concrete way or to even begin the process to build or aspire to a genuine circular economy is, in fact, to challenge the basis of production under the type of capitalist economy we have because the whole basis of production in this economy is the unrestrained use of our natural resources with no regard to natural limits or the consequences of that production or the commodification of every possible resource, such as water, clean air, decent food and others that are essential for life.<\/p><p>&quot;Externalities&quot; is a word used by economists to categorise the costs of and damage done by this model of production - the pollution, despoliation and overuse and depletion of natural gifts - but these are not unfortunate asides or unforeseen consequences.  They are essential to production for profit and at the heart of how it takes place.  If externalities were truly costed and paid for by the oil, gas, plastics and petrochemical industries, all those industries would be bankrupted by now.  The system effectively privatises profit and socialises environmental destruction.<\/p><p>The idea of a circular economy is at the centre of any sane response to the multiple environmental crises we face.  As with every policy that seeks to address a crisis or an aspect of capitalism, it is often mangled from the original concept of the system itself to being co-opted into the idea of extracting maximum financial reward from any product, activity or resource.  The core idea is to have an economy that moves away from the model of take, make and throw away towards a model of create, repair and reuse more where we carefully use the gifts that nature has given society and from which society benefits.  It should not be an economy for the profit of a tiny minority.  We should move away from a system based, as Rachel Carson says, on &quot;the gods of profit and production.&quot;<\/p><p>Our problem with this Bill is that it does not deliver on its goal.  No legislation on its own can do so because it would challenge the fabric of capitalist production.  The Bill does not have an aspiration in that direction.  In its 93 sections, what consumes the largest space?  Is it banning single-use plastics such as the fork I used in exhibit A, fining producers or covering a greater range of products that those producers will be held responsible for at the end of the life of those products?  No.  Is it banning harmful chemicals used in creating packaging, banning pesticides or perhaps starting to look at how the privatisation of waste management has damaged the goals of reducing waste and safeguarding the environment?  No.  The largest block of this Bill is concerned with the use of CCTV cameras by local authorities and recordings made by officials using mobile phones.  I note the frustration expressed by all the Deputies who have been local authority councillors.  I understand the issue of illegal dumping and fly-tipping is a big problem.  For example, Dublin City Council spends on average &euro;1 million a year cleaning up after fly-tipping on the streets, while the companies that were privatised and make vast profits from bin charges contribute nothing to the project of dealing with fly-tipping.  Much of the fly-tipping happens because people, particularly in poorer communities, cannot afford the ever-increasing cost of bin charges.<\/p><p>To be honest, CCTV is all over my estate, for example, but nobody looks at it because staffing levels in the local authority have been cut back.  The staffing levels in the Garda station are otherwise affected.  Nobody watches the CCTV coverage.  I do not know about rural Clare or east Galway, but that is certainly the case in big cities such as Dublin and I imagine it is the same in Limerick, Cork and Waterford.<\/p>  <p>Nobody in the local authorities actually watches this stuff.  The chunk of the Bill concerned with this is very worrying.  It is disturbing, to say the least.<\/p> <p> We face widespread pollution from industrial sources that are damaging our rivers and urban and rural areas.  We have crises in water quality and water management.  We have a boom in mining activity triggered by a rush for certain scarce and rare minerals, resulting in fears over long-term damage to our watercourses.  The campaign against mining in Ireland has issued the statistic that the global gold industry has been the driver of a mining rush in Ireland to the extent that Ireland, north and south, has been identified as a hotspot for the European mining boom.  To date, 27% of the south of Ireland and 25% of the North of Ireland have been concessioned for mineral prospecting licences.  Most of the activity is in areas such as the Sperrins in County Tyrone.  Derry, Donegal, Connemara and rural communities in Wicklow have all been affected.  For some of our areas of pristine beauty, we have issued hundreds of mining licences to Canadian and other global corporations.<\/p> <p> Purchasing a Bill on the circular economy and doling out licences for mining to the extent in question all over the country suggests a conflict of interest.  I am struck by the similarity with the climate action legislation.  It was much-anticipated legislation that attempted to address a key environmental crisis but suffered from vague language and multiple get-out clauses in doing so.  In this Bill, we see the repeated use of the word \"may\".  We may do this and we do may that.  There are many strategies and plans, and there are roadmaps to be constructed at a later stage.  Very little use is made of the State's ability to regulate and ban harmful activities.  While we welcome the efforts to address the single-use plastic issue, it has to be said that the time taken and the various loopholes that allow for the continued production of single-use plastic in the coming years are very worrying.  It has been pretty clear that alternatives to almost all the products discussed here are possible, apart from where there is a relatively small need in medical and some specialised cases.<\/p> <p> Given what we now know, our marine environment is drowning in plastic.  Some 70% of all marine litter comes from the ten most commonly found single-use plastics.  In Ireland, we produce up to 80% more plastic packaging per head than the rest of Europe.  We generate 27% more municipal waste than the European average.  We should have seen stronger timelines and actions.  While we welcome the banning of some single-use plastics, the associated timelines are worrying.  While we can introduce amendments, the charge for disposable cups is not what is needed given the scale of the crisis.  It smacks a little of the carbon tax in that the measure punishes the behaviour of people rather than the corporations and producers of the waste.<\/p> <p> Regarding the lack of definite targets, the Bill states the Minister \"may\" introduce targets for a waste management plan, but it would have been preferable to see those targets in the legislation.  Again, we will try to amend the legislation in this regard.  Until we see a circular-economy strategy and programme, or the food waste prevention strategy, it is hard, if not impossible, to know how seriously to take this Bill.  In short, I welcome the reference to the circular economy but am puzzled by the fact that the legislation seems to attach such little importance to that economy in the here and now.<\/p> <p> I am alarmed by the plan to deal with food waste as one of the key policies having regard to Food Vision 2030, a policy that has correctly been labelled by farmers interested in sustainability as an expansion plan for Ireland to become a world leader in sustainable greenwashing, heavy on spin while thrashing the Paris Agreement obligation.  A policy that embeds the model of dairy expansion and the creation of more markets abroad should not be mentioned in the same breath as food waste prevention or a circular economy Bill.<\/p> <p> I fail to see how the circular economy Bill can be serious if it does not seek to address the disaster of municipal waste management.  The privatisation of municipal waste management has been a disaster &mdash; a disaster for workers, the environment, householders and ultimately the local authorities, which are picking up the pieces and the tab for the private companies, all of which are registered offshore and make vast profits, while the cost to the ordinary household goes up and up and the fly-tipping increases all the time.<\/p> <p> I want to comment on what is heralded as a key element, the extra charge of between 20 cent and &euro;1 on disposable cups.  It speaks to the common theme of how the Green Party, in particular, addresses environmental crises.  The charge is a miniature version of the carbon tax, a policy based on the idea of changing the behaviour of people but allowing multiple loopholes and get-out causes regarding certain products.  This highlights the corporate and systemic nature of the problem.  The thinking is that we can keep manufacturing the products under certain circumstances but will charge people for using them.  While drowning in a sea of plastic and choking all the species in the marine environment, we are dragging our feet on the banning of the manufacture of such damaging products.  What timelines stretch to 2030 given the scale of the crisis now?  We are to expect a deposit-and-return system for bottles later in the year, but this should also be in the legislation.<\/p> <p> The mistaken belief is that the environmental crisis can be tackled by neoliberal measures that charge our behaviour out of existence, but only if it can happen and if aimed at individuals.  The measures are never aimed at businesses and corporate entities that ultimately benefit from the production and manufacturing involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000059#MMM00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648661820,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I learned a couple of things when I was in Palestine when I was about 18.  First, I learned that Israel is an apartheid state and that we need to do something about it.  While I was there, I was working in the desert growing tomatoes, melons and all sorts of other crops.  An interesting point that has always stuck with me is that each morning when the farmers were producing the tomatoes for the European export market, we poured into big vats the contents of massive bags of chemicals whose purpose was to keep the tomatoes solid so they would still look good at the other end when transported vast distances to Europe.  The nice tomatoes &mdash; beautiful tomatoes with no chemicals &mdash; were produced for the local market.  They were absolutely gorgeous.  They did not look exactly the same as the ones on the shelves here but they were the tasty ones.  There were no chemicals in them at all.<\/p>  <p>  I learned something else in Israel: the rotten melons produced by the Israeli farm were sent to Gaza.  There is a very important lesson in that experience.  It relates to the discussion Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and I had with farmers the other day.  The matter has been highlighted by the Ukraine crisis.  We believed we were feeding the world but discovered we were not when the Ukraine crisis arose.  We rear many cows and export them and many dairy-related products but we could be in danger of not being able to feed ourselves, or even the cows, because we do not grow enough grain, vegetables and other foods.  That we import these products and that they are transported all across the world means more chemicals and plastic, the emission of more fumes, more waste and more destruction of the environment rather than diversifying agriculture to produce food locally so we do not need loads of chemicals and plastic packaging.  Diversifying agriculture would give us food security, reduce waste and give a more certain existence to farmers and others, but we would have to support our farmers in doing so.<\/p> <p> That is the logic of the way neoliberal capitalism operates.  I know people do not like it when we use these slogans, but that is the truth.  Capitalism specialises in the production of cheap products on massive scales for exports to the market, not for production for need at a local level.  The consequences for the environment are disastrous.  I will give another simple example.  When I and the Ceann Comhairle were young, we used to get milk delivered by milkmen in glass bottles.  We left the empty bottles out every day and they were reused over and over again.  When I worked in the Netherlands, the same was done with beer bottles.  When people bought Heineken or Amstel, they had to bring the bottles back to the shop where they bought them.  We bought more and got money back when we brought the bottles back.  The bottles were used over and over again.  Then we got Tetra Pak, which involved massive amounts of carbon that are a complete waste of resources.  That happened somebody was able to make money out of it.  It was all about the commodification of these things rather than doing things in a rational way.<\/p> <p> It is all very well talking about the circular economy, which I am in favour of, but I want to stress that we are letting loose the forces that are destroying the circular economy.  We have to give local authorities the necessary staffing, resources and infrastructure required for a circular economy.  The Minister of State knows this.  In our area we do not have anything near like the numbers of staff in the cleansing department that are needed.  People have to have a massive fight to get a bin anywhere.  We do not have anything like the resources necessary in local authorities to provide for the recycling, reuse and so on that we would need to have a meaningful circular economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000060#NNN00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648662420,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I attended a Wellbeing Economy Alliance, WEALL, event at the weekend.

I will send the Deputy some membership forms.  The transfer season might be open soon.<\/p>  <p>  The circular economy Bill moves in the right direction.  It contains measures which move us away from the idea of take, make, waste, which follows a slavish idea of GDP and economic throughput as being the good we always chase after.  It is moving us towards a more circular economy model.  It will fit well with the move towards well-being budgeting.  The two things will sit well together and it is to be hoped we will begin to move away from the slavish pursuit of GDP growth.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that we have alignment with the rest of the EU because the European Commission today announced the circular economy action plan which proposes new regulations to make almost all physical goods more sustainable and energy efficient throughout their life cycle.  The regulations will impact all aspects of that life cycle through design, usage, repurposing and disposal of products.  We are seeing two facets of government at a national and European level beginning to work together to move us somewhat in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the comments of Deputy Stanley.  One thing I particularly welcome is that local authorities will be empowered to use GDPR compliance technologies such as CCTV and drones to protect detect and prevent unsightly and illegal dumping and littering.  I disagree with Deputy Smith on this point.  It was used extremely effectively in Waterford.  Many extremely scenic areas are unfortunately blighted by illegal dumping and fly-tipping.  In 2020, Waterford City and County Council was officially reprimanded by the Data Protection Commissioner for its use of CCTV, one of seven local authorities to be so reprimanded.  <\/p>  <p>  Technology makes a big difference.  There are areas in the county which are difficult for local authority council staff to access.  CCTV and drone technology was being used very effectively in order to fight fly-tipping.  I welcome that section 14A and the new section 14B will allow for mobile recording devices for preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting offences under the 1996 Act.  It is timely and a step in the right direction.  It is only a small measure in a larger Bill, but it will make a difference to people on the ground.  There are other measures in the Bill which are extremely welcome.

The Committee on Environment and Climate Action, which I Chair, was tasked with pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  I note Deputies O'Rourke and Smith, who are members of the committee, are present.  They worked on pre-legislative scrutiny, as did I and Deputy Whitmore, who spoke earlier.  I commend them on their efforts.<\/p>  <p>  I commend my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, who was appointed as a rapporteur on this issue.  He compiled an extensive report for the committee and his efforts underpin the pre-legislative scrutiny report which we published in the autumn.  In that report we put forward 62 recommendations to strengthen the Bill, and I wish to note that the provisions of the Bill bring very positive developments.  However, I have some concerns about whether the language of some of the Bill is strong enough to ensure the legislation works in the long term and not just in the short and medium term.<\/p>  <p>  Colleagues across the House have noted in the debate that the current global economy is based on a linear model of production and consumption, a model that is economically and environmentally unsustainable.  Global demand for raw materials for things like food, electrical goods and clothes is increasing sharply and it is clear, perhaps now more than ever, that we need to find smarter and more efficient ways of using those raw materials.  <\/p>  <p>  In the past two years, we have faced a global pandemic and, as a consequence, a public health crisis.  As life finally started to return to normal, Vladimir Putin's cowardly invasion of Ukraine caused unimaginable suffering for the people of Ukraine and instigated a further crisis in Europe and the world.  The current security, energy and humanitarian crises, and the emerging food crisis, are not isolated events; rather, they are intrinsically intertwined.  Following a two-year pandemic, they create a perfect storm that neither our energy dependence on fossil fuels nor the linear model of production and consumption can successfully address and overcome.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken about the security and energy crisis several times in the House.  Today, I want to touch on the food crisis that could affect millions of people.  Even before Putin started a war in Ukraine, the global food system was strained.  Food systems cannot be resilient to crises if they are not sustainable.  Just as with fast fashion, fast food is another extreme example of unsustainable practices that drive the take, make, waste model.  While I might disagree with my colleagues across the House on many issues, I agree with some of Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments.  <\/p>  <p>  The globalisation and commodification of the food market has created huge problems and challenges, one of which is that it has made food cheaper.  As prices are low, consumers consider the products to be disposable.  The growing, processing and transportation of food uses a significant amount of resources.  For all of the food that is wasted, the resources used to produce, deliver and cook it are wasted too.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, Ireland generated just over 1 million tonnes of food waste representing a carbon footprint as high as 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.  Cutting waste in half by 2030, in line with the United Nations sustainable development goals, will support the transition to more sustainable food systems as well as contributing to a reduction in emissions.  However, I note with some regret that the specific waste reduction targets are not included in the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister and Department officials on their work to date in addressing the challenges and provided a legislative framework for the circular economy.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on Committee Stage and I hope he will be in a position to accept amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000061#OOO00500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1648663020,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.

On 1 May, just over one month from now, the Government will add fuel to the fire and punish those who cannot afford to change their behaviour in the context of climate change mitigation.  Many of my constituents would love to install solar panels and other renewable technology but they simply cannot afford it.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for councils to use CCTV to try to prevent illegal dumping, with a code of practice for the use of CCTV to be drawn up.  It will also allow councils to use drones and other mobile recording devices to try to prevent illegal dumping.  It is important that the protection is extended to community CCTV, which is currently in legal limbo.  Every summer in particular, the roadsides of rural counties Kildare and Laois become a night-time dumping ground.  That is partly a result of this Government and the previous one abdicating their responsibilities and allowing, in effect, the privatisation of domestic waste collection services.  We need to bring domestic waste services back into public responsibility.  Councils are struggling to provide mattress recycling days in some municipal districts and they must be properly resourced.  All Members have seen the video of mattress dumping in rural County Offaly.  It is only the tip of the iceberg in the context of what is going on in Kildare.<\/p>  <p>  Some people would say that is no wonder when the Department of Defence is getting away scot free with dumping God knows what while filling in the hollow next to Donnelly's Hollow on the Curragh.

In a further waste of taxpayers' money, the Department gave Kildare County Council a choice between mediation and taking the Department of Defence to court.  The taxpayer was left with a mediation bill of more than &euro;22,000 at the end of the process, as well as a veil of secrecy that nobody, not even the Minister, will lift.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will not facilitate the introduction of a deposit and return scheme which the Minister of State knows is long overdue.

I am not sure whether the Minister of State has spent any time in the personal hygiene aisles of supermarket of late.  He would be appalled at the amount of single-use and other plastic there.  The idea that much of it is being recycled is completely incorrect.  He is probably young or old enough to remember replaceable razor blades.  This will require considerable change and something has to be done to get people back to preferring to use, reuse and recycle.  <\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State is aware there is no viable recycling of single-use plastics.  They either go into landfill or are incinerated.  Has anyone in his Department considered the increased quantity of single-use plastics in food packaging?  Styrofoam trays are being used for meat products, while single use-plastic is used for shampoo and soap products.  We need to incentivise alternative packaging such as cellulose packaging, Tetra Pak or glass instead of plastics.  How is this change to be achieved in the context of the price differential?  Time must be spent considering that in the context of the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards food waste, significant volumes of food and fruit are produced and imported into this country every year but never find their way into consumers' fridges.  Best before dates are utilised to ensure food integrity but there is often a significant difference between the best before date and when a product is actually out of date.  Much of this food waste ends up as organic waste and in some cases can be used as animal feed but much of it could be used in biological digestive systems for energy production.  However, we do not have our act together yet to incentivise that activity or get any production from it.  Is the Minister of State aware that it is producers who suffer the cost of this food waste rather than supermarkets or other retailers?  If one wants to tackle the issue of food waste in the supermarket sector, one needs to look at the purchasing practices employed by supermarkets.  They order minimum supply quantities and when products go unsold, that is at the expense of the producer.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the circular economy fund provided for in the Bill.  He stated this is building on the objectives of the environment fund.  He is proposing that this fund be developed through the Bill, with the aim being to fund key environmental projects in the coming years.  Those are lofty aspirations.  Are these environmental projects to be evaluated and assessed into the future?  I have worked with many companies in the food sector that are seeking to develop significant innovation in terms of manufacturing, packaging, increased shelf life, etc. and, in nearly all cases, the level of and access to State resourcing was almost negligible in the context of supporting that activity.  It is my experience that we do not have a great record in transformational innovation in this country unless it comes from the university sector.  It largely tends to be ignored when it comes from the commercial sector.  As I stated, these are lofty ambitions but ring-fencing money for use in research and development that is not properly spent is just another form of taxation.  I am interested to see the proposals of the Minister of State in respect of the circular economy as the legislation moves on.<\/p>  <p>   As regards the amendments to the Waste Management Acts, fly-tipping and dumping have been mentioned by several Deputies.  Those activities are a scourge and a blight on the rural environment in particular.  While I was a councillor, I was engaged with Waterford environmental teams in the disgusting activity of going through domestic waste bags dumped on the roadside to look for evidence that would pinpoint the person responsible.  I was amazed even then with the evidence found, such as receipts and correspondence.  The difficulty there was in pursuing a prosecution.  While a member of Waterford City and County Council I asked several times for CCTV to be deployed at a number of problem dumping spots but was informed by the executive that this was not possible because of general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues.  When I tried to set up a private group conducting video monitoring, I was told I was in danger of ending up in the courts because of data legislation.  I note the Bill suggests that number plate recognition or facial recognition is not to be used in this video data.  I await the thoughts of the Minister of State on what evidence can be brought to bear in terms of video analysis without some recognition of vehicle identity that will result in prosecutions for fly-tipping and serial dumping.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the proposals to incentivise the better segregation of waste streams for the commercial sector, leading to greater waste being diverted into recycling or organic bins. However, much of this waste may offer a compostable agriculture product opportunity and this is an area the Department needs to seriously consider.   Organic waste can be a significant alternative to fertiliser products in agriculture.  All present are aware of the current problems we are having internationally in terms of sourcing and paying for fertilisers.  I ask that the Department do significant work on this.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the ban on the exploration for and mining of certain fossils fuels such as coal, lignite and oil shale.  That is progressive. <\/p>  <p>  In summation, there is much in the Bill to be welcomed although it must be stated that much of it is aspirational at this time.  Many of the objectives, particularly in respect of consumer behaviour, will require a significant degree of cultural shift.  There are likely to be additional supply chain costs to be borne and that will affect the end price.  How will that be managed in the context of imported competitor products?  One thing is certain - it will be difficult to change consumer behaviour without some cost-benefit recognition on the part of consumers.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>This will not happen without significant re-education and reinforcement on both the environmental damages that are being caused by our present consumption patterns and the possible environmental benefits that can accrue if we adopt a new reuse-recycle policy.<\/p> <p> I welcome that the Minister of State's Bill sets out a roadmap for the future circular economy.  Although, like many, I fear its publication may be a great deal easier to complete than the practice it wishes us to change.  I, therefore, ask that the Minister of State and his Department engage early, often and repeatedly with manufacturing, trade and retail sectors so that the policy objectives he desires in this Bill may be mutually agreed and may possibly be permitted in the future.

I welcome the publication and the progress of the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022.  It is another step forward in this Government&rsquo;s taking actions, which I regard as climate brave.  I will come back to that point of politicians and voters being brave on climate action because without us taking those difficult decisions, incentivising and, in some cases, de-incentivising different measures, we will not solve the climate crisis and will not do what is required to address this planet being on fire.<\/p>  <p>  We know we can reduce our use of fossil fuels, which is needed, but the transition from fossil fuels will only address 55% of emissions.  The remaining 45% comes from the things that we make.  We need to end our culture of making and wasting, which were many of the values that previous generations in Ireland implemented without a circular economy Bill.  Instead, we need to adopt a more circular economy focused on use and reuse.  <\/p>  <p>  There are different ways in which we can do that and we know that individual consumer choices are key but that will never achieve the type of change we need, so I welcome some of the system change that is so crucial in addressing climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Communities will be so important in addressing this issue and I want to give credit here to two organisations which have educated me on the issue.  One is Dublin City Council, my own local authority which does very significant work in educating our climate ambassadors, that is, our Tidy Towns groups which are in every community in the city.  I refer also to the Rediscovery Centre in Ballymun, which I know the Minister of State visited.  I encourage any school student in the country, and their teachers, to make contact with this centre in Ballymun.  This was an old heating facility which used to heat the Ballymun flats, which have been demolished.  With the use of European Union money and a great deal of renewable technology, we have been able to repurpose that as a showcase for renewable use and for rediscovery.  My open call to the schoolchildren of Ireland is to come to Ballymun to discover what they can do with the circular economy.  Those institutions educated me about this issue and, in some ways, encouraged me to be brave about it.  <\/p>  <p>  Yes, this will involve additional costs for consumers, which is what a levy is, and we have to be honest about that.  Like other environmental taxes, we are making things that are bad for our community, our country and our planet more expensive.  We do not want to collect these taxes and we want people to switch away from these things but in order to do that, we need to increase the cost of some of these items.  That is a difficult decision, particularly in the context of a cost of living increase.  <\/p>  <p>  We are also putting alternatives in place and that transition towards those alternatives needs to be at least as ambitious as the financial instruments that are so easy to implement.  We know the transition is much more difficult and takes more time but we need to be at least as ambitious on those alternative options.  We cannot penalise people and not provide the alternatives.<\/p>  <p>  When we take climate action, it involves opportunities but it also involves unpopular decisions and what I call being climate brave.  Like the addition of cycle and bus lanes, which take road space away from cars, we need to be honest with people that what we are doing there is actively discouraging and discommoding drivers in order that we can make the change to save our planet.  That is what we are doing and we should be honest with people.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, we know that not everybody can cycle and that public transport is less convenient than the mobile heated armchair that many of our cars have become but we are doing this, not to discommode or to attack drivers, but because we know that is what we need to do in order to tackle the climate crisis.  <\/p>  <p>  Like the densities of housing developments, we have to be honest with people that building more dense communities may mean we have fewer traditional homes with front and back gardens.  Why are we doing this?  We are doing it because we need to create more sustainable communities.<\/p>  <p>  With the carbon tax, we are increasing the cost of carbon fuels because we want to create a fund for a just transition that will protect those on low incomes and will finance retrofitting to end our dependence on fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  All of these measures require climate brave decisions by politicians.  They require politicians who are willing to take those brave decisions, often unpopular, and it requires voters to reward politicians who are climate brave and are going to make those difficult decisions.  Too often in here, I have seen  Members of this House lurching towards the easy answers, to the less brave decisions and to the populist options.  That may get a person re-elected but it will not save the planet.  <\/p>  <p>  I say to people to remember the politicians who introduced the smoky coal ban, the plastic bag levies, and who banned smoking to improve air quality in public buildings.  History looks more favourably on those people who are brave.  I ask that we say to voters to look at those politicians who are being climate brave and reward them.<\/p>  <p>  On the details of the Bill, I want to point to sections 11 to 13, inclusive, in respect of the levy, and section 14, which will allow a prohibition.  If the levy does not work, we have to move quickly towards a prohibition.  <\/p>  <p>  We already have regulations on a deposit and return scheme from last year, if I am correct.  I know a number of Members of the Opposition did not look at the regulations issued last year.  We need to move quickly to have those implemented.  Hundreds of people attend football matches and, unfortunately, bottles and cans are left behind.  Football clubs in my area have often said they would love to collect those cans and use them as a revenue source to ensure those materials are stored away safely.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to the issue of CCTV.  My community, more than any, is scourged by illegal dumping and it is done by people within my community.  The CCTV measures here get us back to a point where it is legally possible to use CCTV but it will not be the solution to illegal dumping.  We have to go further and give local authorities more nominated officers to issue fines and to equip them in that respect.  We are way behind in what we can do in tackling illegal dumping.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the measures in this Bill.  We should also look at Senator Malcolm Byrne&rsquo;s Bill on the CCTV issue and on emerging drone technologies, for example, to address it. A great deal of good work has been done in respect of this Bill and I encourage the Minister of State to keep going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000063#QQQ00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1648663620,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McAuliffe.

For those who may not know, I live in Cashel, County Tipperary, a town with an amazing heritage, location and people.  I was involved in a zero-waste pilot programme from 2017 until July 2018.  Its aim was to reduce waste by 25% through a number of different initiatives involving the community.  It had a particular focus on ending the bad habit of using single-use products when alternatives could be found or, indeed, having those products repaired or recycled to become of use again.  This ranged from waste reduction workshops for repair and reuse of products, up-cycling, and so on.  There was very significant interest and buy-in from the local community and it very much showed us what could be done if we all adopt measures which promote sustainability.  There is a public appetite for this, especially given the money-saving nature of it which cannot be overstated.  <\/p>  <p>  This is particularly relevant to what we are talking about today which is adopting measures to develop the so-called circular economy, involving a move away from single-use disposable items, and advocating a more sustainable way of manufacturing and consumption.  This can be done through manufacturers adopting production methods that not only ensure they cut down on non-biodegradable packaging, such as plastics, but also ensure the product itself, if non-perishable, can be repaired if worn or broken and reused.<\/p>  <p>  We need to throw off the mindset of single-use items and that is why there is a need for the inclusion in this Bill of measures to deal with single-use cups and containers.  When talking about this, we must point out that the raw material resources which we use per year are already 50% greater than nature can replenish in a year.  This will rise by a factor of three by 2050 on present trends.  This is the definition of unsustainable and is where the circular the economy needs to be reinforced by investment in alternatives.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to ensure the methods adopted to deal with the scourge of littering are realistic.  Using technology to monitoring dumping is one thing but it means nothing if that technology is not used when dumping is proven to have taken place.<\/p> <p>We cannot confine this type of monitoring to 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. working hours.  If we do not target it at the time when people are proven to dump rubbish, not only will we waste money and resources we will also do the campaign against littering a disservice by throwing it into disrepute and making it appear to be another waste of public money that is not able to target the scourge of dumping properly.  If we really mean what we say, we cannot do it without the system having real teeth in terms of being able to tackle dumping effectively.<\/p> <p> We support this Bill and will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage where we consider it fit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000063#QQQ00400","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648664220,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Planning and Development (Protect Social Housing) Bill 2020: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1648664220,"counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000064#RRR00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1648664220,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to Second Stage of the Planning and Development (Protect Social Housing) Bill 2020, taken on Thursday, 24 March 2022.
