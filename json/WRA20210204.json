For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest emissions report, published in January 2021, our 2020 emissions covered by our ESD target are estimated to be 7-8% below 2005 levels. Therefore, Ireland will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations under the ESD. The emissions in respect of the ESD sector for 2010 were 44.5 Mt CO2eq, 42.8 in 2013 Mt CO2eq increasing to 45.7 Mt CO2eq in 2019. The most recent EPA report projects 2020 emissions in the sector as 43.9 Mt CO2eq.   The extent of the challenge to reduce emissions was reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The National Policy Position provided a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050, while statutory authority for the plans was set out in the 2015 Act. This led to the development of Ireland&rsquo;s National Mitigation Plan, published in 2017, and National Adaptation Framework, published in 2018. In 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s first Climate Action Plan was published. The ambition in 2019 Plan was further increased in the Programme for Government which sets out an ambitious course of action over the coming years to address the climate crisis.

This will require significant investment in our infrastructure and our services and the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future commits toward such a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland and I look forward to fulfilling that commitment.<\/p>  <p>  I am also clear that within our sustainable mobility sector, or more particularly within public transport, we need to transition toward low-emission and zero-emission fleets in line with available technologies. <\/p>  <p>  In bus, that shift has already commenced with the decision to end the purchase of diesel-only buses for the urban centres, the entry into service of hybrid buses, and most recently the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s\u00a0commencing a procurement process in relation to zero-emission buses for the major urban centres. I understand the NTA is also exploring procurement options for zero-emission fleets in town centres also. This transition is in line with the relevant actions set out in the Climate Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In rail, the key focus has been to expand electrification through the DART+ programme of investment which, once completed, will mean around 70% of passenger journeys across the rail network will be on electrified services and will represent a significant shift from the position today. The scope to expand electrification (or the possible use of battery-electric fleet) to Cork and other urban centres has been, or is being, considered as part of their metropolitan area transport strategies. <\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0 terms of inter-urban rail, which is obviously a much smaller component of total annual passenger journeys as compared to that covered by the DART+ programme, I have stated my commitment to conduct a Strategic Rail Review and it is my intention that one of the issues that Review will consider will be future decarbonisation of the inter-city \/ inter-regional networks. I would note that there is no settled perspective on this matter in a European context, as evidenced by the EU&rsquo;s recently published Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy which notes the need for further electrification but that where electrification is not viable other options such as hydrogen should be explored. It is my intention that the forthcoming Review will give an Irish dimension to that European perspective. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400054#WRB06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":81,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 28 and 29 answered with Question No. 22.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Search and Rescue Service Provision","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[6125\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a value for money policy review was conducted on the current search and rescue agreement in order that its findings can be taken into consideration before any future contract is awarded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>While\u00a0not a Value for Money Policy Review per se,\u00a0aviation consultants\u00a0Aerosurance Ltd carried out a Mid-Term Assessment\u00a0of the contract in 2018 including\u00a0performance and contractual compliance.\u00a0\u00a0The review specifically identified issues to be taken into consideration in relation to the new service.

This is important from an equity point of view as people unaffected by the pandemic who receive &lsquo;normal&rsquo; wages to a similar value are taxed in the usual manner. The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, including exemption from USC and PRSI.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that the Department of Social Protection (DSP) shares taxable benefit payment details, including information relating to the PUP, with Revenue in accordance with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. These data exchanges are subjected to rigorous testing procedures to ensure any information updated to taxpayers&rsquo; records is accurate and fully reflects the information provided to Revenue by DSP, thereby ensuring they pay the right amount of tax in respect of their overall taxable earnings. Revenue has confirmed that the 2020 PAYE &lsquo;Preliminary End of Year Statements&rsquo; (PEOYS), which were made available to all employees on 15 January 2021 included the PUP related data provided by DSP. This data reflected the actual PUP payments made to each person and did not include any element of estimation.

For the information of the Deputy, the link directs to Revenue&rsquo;s material on Frequently Asked Questions on the TWSS:<\/p><p>The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income for the duration of the scheme. \u00a0However, the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, the question of what wages an employer would be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of hours worked and the question of an employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees at pre-COVID levels in the light of the impact of the pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, were matters between the employer and the relevant employees and were outside the remit of the TWSS.\u00a0 <\/p><p>An employer who received TWSS payments under the scheme was obliged to pass on any such payments to its employees.\u00a0 Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing TWSS compliance programme is specifically examining that employers adhered to that requirement, as well as examining employer\/employee eligibility for the TWSS.<\/p><p>Payments made under the TWSS were regarded as income supports and share the characteristics of income.\u00a0 Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.\u00a0 In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC). \u00a0While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and were instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of 2020. <\/p><p>When the TWSS was extended for a further 10 weeks until the end of August 2020, Revenue took steps to minimise the amount of income tax and USC due, if any, on TWSS payments at the end of the year.\u00a0 This was done by placing all recipients of the TWSS or PUP on the &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that arise at year end.  <\/p><p>Although the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on their personal circumstances, and still pending for the overall amount of tax due,\u00a0based on data that Revenue released in January, it is noted that almost half of those in receipt of the PUP or TWSS have no outstanding liability to discharge (in fact over a third are due a refund).<\/p><p>In the case of the remaining taxpayer units with an outstanding liability, the data indicates that amounts to be collected are modest in scale, with 44% owing less than &euro;500 and 72% having a liability of less than &euro;1,000. If paid over the 4 year period beginning in 2022, the majority of those cases will owe less than &euro;5 per week, with nearly half paying less than &euro;2.50 per week.\u00a0 These figures represent a preliminary liability and may be further reduced by additional tax credits or reliefs such as health expenses.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Revenue has also given assurances that if any income tax and USC liabilities remain following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities and a number of flexible arrangements may be entered into, including the collection without interest over an extended period of time for 4 years beginning in 2022.It is also understood that Revenue are facilitating employers who wish to pay the tax liabilities of their employees where such income tax and USC liabilities arise from the scheme.<\/p><p>Revenue made a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees from 15 January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.\u00a0 The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.\u00a0 For the tax year 2020, the Statement also includes information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.\u00a0 In addition, the Statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.<\/p><p>Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees have an opportunity to complete their income tax return for 2020, declaring any additional income and claiming any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.<\/p><p>When a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments\/Repayments facility in myAccount.\u00a0 Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.\u00a0 The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.<\/p><p>Finally, the Preliminary End of Year Statement sets out a provisional tax position for 2020, based on information available on Revenue records, including any Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments reported by the individual&rsquo;s employer.\u00a0 Revenue published provisional statistics in relation to the preliminary end of year tax position for all PAYE taxpayers for the year 2020, on 14 January 2021 which is available to view on Revenue&rsquo;s website:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"World Bank","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC05700"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[6213\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the level of oversight held by his Department of the climate and development funds managed by the World Bank to which Ireland is a donor; the way in which the funding is being used; the frequency and depth of reports provided to his Department in relation to the projects and programmes supported by those funds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for his question and the opportunity it affords me to outline the World Bank&rsquo;s mission and Ireland&rsquo;s contribution in shaping, influencing and supporting this important work. \u00a0<\/p><p>At the outset, I think it may be useful for me to provide clarification in respect of the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to climate and development funds managed by the World Bank. While the Institution applies a climate lens to all of its policies and operations, its primary goals are to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. It recognises the link between poverty\/prosperity and climate and the potential for climate change to push much more of the world's population into poverty by 2030. The World Bank has therefore enjoined the fight against climate change and its Climate Change Action Plan 2021-2025 seeks to mobilise $200 billion in support of developing countries to take climate action during the course of its lifetime. A summary of this plan&rsquo;s ambition, is available at  . The Bank also uses the true cost of carbon in all its projects. Therefore, while the funds the World Bank manages are not dedicated &lsquo;climate&rsquo; funds, as I will outline below, climate considerations significantly influence how the Bank targets it&rsquo;s resources.\u00a0<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the World Bank consists of five separate entities.\u00a0 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) provides loans, credit, and grants to low to middle income countries while the International Development Association (IDA) provides low or no-interest loans and grants to low-income countries. The other parts of the World Bank include: (i) the International Finance Corporation (IFC) which provides investment, advice, and asset management to companies and governments; (ii) the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) which insures lenders and investors against political risk such as war; and (iii) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) which settles investment disputes between investors and countries.\u00a0<\/p><p>Ireland is a donor to IDA, the largest sources of assistance for the world&rsquo;s 74 poorest countries (39 of which are in Africa). Overseen by 173 shareholder nations, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing zero to low-interest loans and grants for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people&rsquo;s living conditions. Since its establishment in 1960, IDA has provided $422 billion for investments in 114 countries. IDA is a multi-issue institution, supporting a range of development activities (including climate change) that pave the way toward equality, economic growth, job creation, higher incomes, and better living conditions. IDA-financed operations address primary education, basic health services, clean water and sanitation, agriculture, business climate improvements, infrastructure, and institutional reforms. The World Bank Group publishes details of all projects and operations, including associated documentation, on their website -  \u00a0.\u00a0<\/p><p>IDA&rsquo;s policy framework is reviewed by its members every three years during the course of the &ldquo;replenishment process&rdquo; when donor members pledge financial support to the institution. Officials from my Department represent Ireland at these meetings in order to articulate Ireland&rsquo;s development priorities and ensure that they are reflected in IDA&rsquo;s policy commitments. For the most recent replenishment, IDA19, members agreed on five special themes for IDA19: climate change; fragility, conflict and violence; gender; governance and institutions; and jobs and economic transformation. IDA19 also incorporates four cross-cutting issues: debt, disability, human capital, and technology. In 2019, Ireland pledged approx. &euro;102m to this replenishment (IDA19), an increase on the &euro;90m commitment to the previous replenishment (IDA18) in 2016.<\/p><p>Aside from IDA progress updates furnished during the course of the formal plenary Spring and Annual Meetings, Mid-Term Review (MTR) meetings are held as part of the formal replenishment process. During the MTR, members review progress on policy commitments and identify any mid-course corrections or adjustments required. My Officials represent me at this event and, in collaboration with other Donor Governor Representatives, rigorously monitor and scrutinise progress against stated objectives across all policy and governance areas. These discussions, which are held over a number of days, provide further opportunity for IDA Donors to engage with Senior Management on the Bank&rsquo;s performance and on programme delivery. \u00a0<\/p><p>To support these discussions, a report on the implementation of the replenishment is provided in advance of the meetings, identifying emerging challenges and lessons learned. Much of this reporting is informed by IDA&rsquo;s Results Measurement System (IDA RMS). Introduced in 2002, the IDA RMS is a key reporting and accountability tool for tracking progress and reporting results achieved by IDA during each replenishment cycle. The IDA RMS provides a snapshot of country-level, long-term development outcomes; development results in countries supported by IDA operations across different sectors; and IDA&rsquo;s organisational and operational effectiveness. Annual reports on the IDA RMS are published on the IDA website - https:\/\/ida.worldbank.org\/results\/rms.\u00a0<\/p><p>The IDA RMS is supplemented by other tools to provide a more comprehensive picture of IDA&rsquo;s activities and impact, including the work conducted by the World Bank&rsquo;s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). The IEG Annual Report on the Results and Performance of the World Bank Group provides analysis of how the different institutions deliver on key goals and more detailed evidence on the performance of country programmes and projects. The Annual Report is available on the World Bank IEG website - . To assist external oversight, the IEG also produces &lsquo;Implementation Status and Results Reports&rsquo; which provide regularly updated information on progress directly from individual projects under implementation and &lsquo;Implementation Completion and Results Reports&rsquo; which record achievements against a project&rsquo;s development objectives.<\/p><p>These toolsets and platforms provide important information on the value and efficacy of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the World Bank. These insights not only inform Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with the Bank but influence and guide analysis and decisions regarding further investment.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to make the Deputy aware that Ireland also provides funding to a number of separate World Bank Trust Funds including:<\/p><p>- Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF)<\/p><p>- Blue Economy in the Caribbean<\/p><p>- International Finance Corporation (IFC) Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS<\/p><p>- Adaptation Fund (AF)<\/p><p>- Global Environment Facility (GEF)<\/p><p>However as these are variously administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications\u00a0as opposed to my Department, I do not propose to comment on Ireland&rsquo;s oversight of these funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sustainable Development Goals","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC06000"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[6216\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department&rsquo;s new statement of strategy will support the implementation of the sustainable development goals; if specific goals and sub-targets have been identified as being particularly relevant to his Department's work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[6221\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the policies and plans through which his Department will be working towards the achievement of the specific sustainable development goals targets that fall under the aegis of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, in September 2015, 193 UN Member Countries including Ireland adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which consist of 169 targets around the 17 high level goals. The SDGs are a global blueprint for collective progress to a more prosperous and sustainable world by 2030. The SDGs are applicable to all countries, developed and developing, and action is required for their implementation both domestically and internationally.<\/p><p>Ireland is committed to implementing the SDGs, and published its first SDG National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 in July 2018. While the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications has lead responsibility\u00a0for promoting and overseeing the coherent implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the whole-of-Government approach to implementation of the SDGs means all Ministers are responsible for implementing the SDGs related to their functions. I have appended in tabular form the goals and sub-targets for which my Department has been assigned responsibility. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will note, the targets assigned to the Department of Finance as either lead or stakeholder extend across a significant range of its business and activities ranging \u00a0from promoting inclusive economic growth to building partnerships for sustainable development. My Department has published these obligations at . While there may be some review of assignment changes in the next National Implementation Plan, significant change is not anticipated. <\/p><p>My Department expects to shortly publish it&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 which shall outline the role the Department of Finance will play in the delivery of the Programme for Government&rsquo;s targets and priorities. I can confirm that the new Statement is informed and guided by the Department&rsquo;s commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s National Implementation Plan which implements the UN SDGs. Acknowledgement of SDG commitments within Statements of Strategy is not only in line with actions championed in the National Implementation Plan but is also an important further step in mainstreaming the SDGs into relevant policies. The Statement of Strategy is critical in the delivery of policy objectives insofar as it provides a framework to translate such objectives into policies and operational business plans designed to achieve implementation. My Department's obligations in respect of the achievement of SDGs have therefore been embedded within the fabric of how it does its business . It is my hope that these steps towards enhanced policy coherence, alignment and mainstreaming of SDGs into policy areas will contribute to an accelerated progression towards SDG implementation.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, delivery on the SDGs is underpinned by an implementation and reporting process. Given the broad scope and cross-cutting nature of the SDGs,\u00a0strong and effective governance arrangements\u00a0which are essential to ensuring high-level engagement with the 2030 Agenda and effective interdepartmental cooperation on the implementation of the Goals, have been put in place. \u00a0A Senior Officials Group (SOG) has been established to co-ordinate and monitor\u00a0SDG\u00a0implementation and to report, as required, to Government. The SOG is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. To further support the work of the SOG, an Interdepartmental SDG Working Group was established, comprised of representatives from all Departments with responsibilities for the SDGs. To accentuate the all-of-Government approach and ensure policy coherence, my Department is supportive and fully engages with this SDG governance architecture. <\/p><p>My Department also continues to participate in SDG Stakeholders Forums. These events provide an opportunity to engage with stakeholders and civil society groups on an ongoing basis in relation to SDG implementation. These are all important channels of reporting and monitoring SDG progress. The convening of such fora have been understandably curtailed by the pandemic, but will no doubt be reactivated when circumstances permit. <\/p><p>Internationally, the UN High-level Political Forum\u00a0(HLPF) is responsible for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda at the global level. The HLPF meets annually and features inputs from national governments, intergovernmental bodies, relevant UN agencies, civil society and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>Countries are encouraged to review implementation of the\u00a0SDGs regularly and present Voluntary National Reviews (VNR) at the HLPF. Ireland presented its first VNR at the HLPF in July 2018. Having input into the first VNR , I expect my Department to be an active contributor in the next National Review in 2022.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also be\u00a0aware that, as of\u00a02020, the\u00a0EU Semester process of Economic governance and coordination has a new focus on Green and Sustainable issues. This new focus takes account of the European Green Deal as Europe&rsquo;s new growth strategy, and incorporates the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals into all stages of the process. Progress towards achieving the UN SDGs are monitored within this process using:<\/p><p>- The Country Report for each Member State which contains data\u00a0 setting out the\u00a0 progress in each Member\u00a0State across the 17 SDGs towards achieving these Goals by 2030, and<\/p><p>- Each Member State&rsquo;s National Reform\u00a0Programme assesses performance in implementing the UN SDGs.<\/p><p>These documents are made publicly available as soon as they are published.<\/p><p>ANNEX 1 _Department of Finance - Sustainable Development Goals and Targets<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC06500"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[6229\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC06600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of complaints submitted to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman which are yet to be allocated to a complaint handler; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[6230\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC06700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of complaints submitted to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman which are yet to be allocated to a complaint handler disaggregated by the number of weeks since they were first submitted with intervals of one week.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[6231\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400055#WRC06800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of complaints submitted to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman which remain unresolved disaggregated by the number of months since they were first submitted with intervals of one month.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 55 and 56 together.<\/p><p>Firstly, I must point out that the\u00a0Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) is independent in the performance of his statutory functions.\u00a0 I have no role in the day to day workings of the office or in the decisions which he takes.<\/p><p>The FSPO has informed me that\u00a0it\u00a0has improved the quality and speed of\u00a0its service considerably over the last year.

As a result, &euro;21.8 billion has been prioritised for investment in the low carbon transition, with a further &euro;8.6 billion allocated for investment in sustainable public transport. Specific investments identified include flagship investment programmes such as supports for energy efficiency and retro-fitting, to the delivery of major new public transport projects such as MetroLink and BusConnects. In addition, the &euro;500 million Climate Action Fund is also providing funding on a competitive basis for initiatives that contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets or offer the potential for innovative interventions in these sectors. More generally the approach to sustainable compact growth that is set out in the National Planning Framework and the NDP will support a more balanced pattern of development across the country. This will put an end to the urban sprawl of the past and support greater sustainability and climate resilience.<\/p>  <p>  As you may be aware, I have commenced a review of the NDP that is taking place currently. In line with the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals, this review will be focussed on how can Project Ireland 2040 be further supported to deliver on the policy priorities in the Programme for Government, particularly climate action. Also, the NDP Review will focus on balanced regional growth and alignment with Ireland's spatial\u00a0strategy of NPF.\u00a0Overall, timelines include a\u00a0Phase 1 report\u00a0to be published by the end of Q1 2021, which will form part of the evidence base for finalising the drafting of the revised NDP; and\u00a0Phase 2, which will be a\u00a0revised NDP setting ten year capital ceilings out to 2030 alongside five year rolling departmental capital ceilings and priorities would be published in Q2 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Sub-action under SDG goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns<\/p>  <p>  Update on the promotion of sustainable\u00a0public procurement practices<\/p>  <p>  Metrics are key to enable monitoring and verification of any measures introduced aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of public works projects. \u00a0In this regard the Office of Government Procurement is currently engaged with the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS) coalition in the development of an international reporting system for whole life carbon in the built environment. \u00a0The ICMS coalition anticipate that ICMS 3rd Edition, incorporating Life Cycle Analysis, will be available for public consultation by September 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the work on developing standard metrics, consideration is also being given to the following:<\/p>  <p>  - The incorporation of Life Cycle Analysis into the design stage,<\/p>  <p>  - The availability of open source Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) to industry,<\/p>  <p>  - Development of award criteria for assessment of tenders incorporating Life Cycle Analysis,<\/p>  <p>  - Development of guidance for the incorporation and evaluation of Life Cycle Analysis in public procurement.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) published an Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement in late 2018. This note helps policy makers and practitioners understand how procurement can be used to facilitate the advancement of existing social policy objectives, including environmental sustainability, as well as the wider context and implications of including them in particular procurement projects. In conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the OGP has introduced reforms that require all Departments to consider including green criteria in public procurement processes. Circular 20\/2019 also requires Departments to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles and highlights the possibilities for Departments to deliver wider social and environmental aims through public procurement. The OGP also assisted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in developing training in this area aimed at procurement practitioners and have contributed to the upcoming EPA Green Public Procurement Guidance. The OGP also established a cross Departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group in March 2019, now called the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, bringing together officials from policy Departments with procurement practitioners to share best practice and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400056#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400056#WRD03800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400056#WRD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[6137\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400056#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>Minister Catherine Martin and I announced the allocation of an &euro;85 million funding support package for the Irish sport sector in November and December. <\/p><p>The funding, which was allocated by Sport Ireland, will address the existential threat to National Governing Bodies and their club networks, allowing sports organisations to offset significant losses incurred and add a semblance of certainty to their planning for 2021.\u00a0<\/p><p>The funding package includes COVID-19 funding of &euro;70 million, to provide support for the three main field sports organisations (the FAI, GAA and IRFU), a Resilience Fund to support the National Governing Bodies of Sport, a Sports Club Resilience Fund to support clubs, and a Sports Restart and Renewal Fund.\u00a0<\/p><p>In total, &euro;2.83 million was allocated to Golf Ireland (formerly the Confederation of Golf in Ireland), comprising &euro;2.7 million under the NGB Resilience Fund, &euro;30,000 under the Sports Restart and Renewal Fund and &euro;100,000 under the Sports Club Resilience Fund.\u00a0<\/p><p>Funding for individual clubs under the Sports Club Resilience Fund is being delivered directly by the National Governing Bodies through programmes established by each of the National Governing Bodies in receipt of funding.

It eliminates the need for individual applications and professional assessments in order to access resources and facilitates schools allocating the available resources to those with greatest need. <\/p>  <p>  One feature of the School Inclusion Model is the development of a frontloaded allocation model of SNAs.\u00a0 Frontloading SNA support eliminates the need for an individual assessment for each student, ending the link with the requirement for a formal diagnosis to gain access to support, and will reduce the delays in making supports available to schools. The proposed arrangements when implemented will also improve job security for SNAs in schools ensuring greater certainty for SNAs in relation to their employment status.<\/p>  <p>  It had been planned that the frontloaded model of allocation for SNAs would be rolled out to all schools from the commencement of the 2020\/21 school year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, due to the disruption caused by Covid-19 and the closure of school buildings in March 2020. It was decided that the introduction of the model would be deferred for one year i.e. to the start of the 2021\/22 school year.\u00a0 This will allow time for the necessary planning and training for schools.<\/p>  <p>  As an interim step, SNA allocations were frozen at their current levels for 2020\/21 with provision for additionality where necessary. Department Circular 30\/2020 sets out the arrangements for SNA allocations for the 2020\/21 school year.<\/p>  <p>  Schools were advised in the first instance to review and reprioritise deployment of all SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources on the basis that those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. <\/p>  <p>  Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014. SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  Where schools consider their SNA allocation to be inadequate to meet\u00a0current needs,\u00a0a school can seek a review by making an application to the NCSE.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in relation to\u00a0national rollout of the frontloaded model\u00a0for the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed. These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the\u00a0Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement. As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school \/ ETB.<\/p>  <p>  Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his\/her employer that s\/he is to be made redundant then s\/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2020\/2021 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0036\/2020 which issued on\u00a013 May 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0036\/2020 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his\/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58\/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.<\/p>  <p>  The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager,\u00a0the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU).<\/p>  <p>  My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400058#WRF05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400058#WRF05100"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[6311\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400058#WRF05200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the holding of the 2021 junior certificate examinations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":334,"content":"<p>My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students, teachers and families as a result of COVID-19. The pandemic has brought significant challenges to the education system, and I am acutely aware of the impacts that this has had on those students preparing to sit their final examinations. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  The planning work underway in respect of the State Examinations in 2021 is being assisted by an Advisory Group of key stakeholders which has met on a number of occasions in recent months. The advisory group has been convened to advise Government on all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures.\u00a0 The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p>  <p>  At a meeting of the group on 22 January, the Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union presented its Report on the 2021 State Examinations and Return to School. Following this meeting, the group agreed that there would be an intensive set of engagements in respect of exploring further possible options for the examinations, having regard to the findings of the recent ISSU Report on the 2021 State Examinations. <\/p>  <p>  The sub-group exploring these options has since met on three occasions and has discussed further possible measures that could be taken to address the demands on students preparing for the examinations.\u00a0 Having regard to the impact of current school closures for face-to-face tuition, there was also discussion on the scope and form of assessment for the various examination components, written and non-written. <\/p>  <p>  All partners are committed to acting in the interests and wellbeing of students, who are at the heart of this process.<\/p>  <p>  A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Education also took place on 1 February which provided an opportunity for consideration of possible options prior to consideration by Government as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Junior Cycle students, have been engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.<\/p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the original closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074\/2020 (Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.

A 117% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised early learning and care and school-age childcare. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available &ndash; by up to 60 percent.<\/p>  <p>  First 5, the ten-year whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families pledges to build on this progress. Among key strategic actions in First 5 is a commitment to 'maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised ELC and SAC to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families'.<\/p>  <p>  To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including an update of the National Planning Guidelines for the development of early learning and care and school-age childcare settings, the extension of regulation to all paid, non-relative childminders on a phased basis and the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040. The development of a new funding model for EELC and SAC also seeks to address issues of accessibility. <\/p>  <p>  There is also a commitment to strengthen capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand for early learning and care and school-age childcare. Supply of, and demand for, early learning and care and school-age childcare places is currently monitored annually through the Early Years Sector Profile. This survey is conducted by Pobal on behalf of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  More information can be found at first5.gov.ie and at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also introduced a range of funding measures to support the sector in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Government decided on January 6 to implement Level 5 restrictions in order to reduce movement in the population, suspending the ECCE programme until 1 February, now extended to 5 March. In order to support the ELC and SAC sector up to 5 March, the Department has announced a range of new funding measures. <\/p>  <p>  The new funding arrangements are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Services open during this period will continue to receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes (i.e. the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), the Community Childcare Subvention Plus  (CCSP), and the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)) These services can also receive the additional 30% of ECCE Programme funding if they commit to certain conditions that include waiving fees for parents not using the service and retaining staff where possible.   <\/p>  <p>  - Services closed during this period, where the closure is approved by the Department, will receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes (i.e. NCS, CCSP, and AIM). This funding will be conditional on a commitment to waive fees for parents and retain staff where possible.<\/p>  <p>  - A newly designed Covid-19 Support Payment has been put in place to support providers with a significant reliance on parental fee income to waive fees during this period while remaining sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  - My Department estimates that the overwhelming majority of providers will be sustainable with these measures. For the small numbers where there are particular challenges, the Sustainability Fund will open a new strand of funding tailored to the present arrangements.  <\/p>  <p>  Central to the funding arrangements is the enhanced EWSS, which early learning and childcare providers continue to be eligible to access without having to demonstrate reduction in turnover as other employers do.  The enhanced EWSS is estimated to cover 80% of payroll costs or 50% of the full operating costs of the average service.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to monitor supply and demand in partnership with the CCCs during COVID-19. Services experiencing difficulty are asked to contact their local CCCs for support. This support can include help with applying staff ratios, fee setting, addressing cash flow difficulties, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. <\/p>  <p>The Department&rsquo;s COVID-19 guidance in full can be found at first5.gov.ie\/guidance  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400059#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parental Leave","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400059#WRG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[6061\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400059#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the status of his plans to introduce legislation to allow for three extra weeks parental leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>The Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 introduced two weeks of paid Parents' Leave for each parent to be taken in the first year after the birth or adoptive placement of a child.

It contains 76 targeted actions aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion across all aspects of Irish society, including increased focus on social inclusion measures and improved access to public services. It also aims to addresses racism and xenophobia, representing a whole-of-Government approach.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of this Strategy is overseen by a Steering Committee comprised of Government Departments and Agencies, local authorities, local communities, the business sector, sporting and arts organisations and NGOs, which examine and report on issues concerning integration. <\/p>  <p>  The MIS was initially due to end in 2020.\u00a0 However, with actions adversely impacted by the onset of Covid-19, the decision has been made to extend the strategy to the end of December 2021. This extension will enable the actions of the Strategy to continue to be implemented while facilitating the preparations for a new strategic policy approach to migrant integration. <\/p>  <p>  Building on the work of the MIS Mid-Term Progress Report, published in June 2019, an evaluation of the strategy will be conducted before the Strategy&rsquo;s conclusion. Issues concerning people of African descent in Ireland and the wider black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in Ireland will be examined as part of this work to inform the development of a robust successor strategy to the MIS.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the recommendations of the mid-term progress report of the Migrant Integration Strategy, an Anti-Racism Committee has been established to help in the fight against racial discrimination in Ireland. The Anti-Racism Committee has a mandate to develop an understanding of the nature and prevalence of racism in Ireland, and to work towards achieving a social consensus on actions required, by State and non-State.\u00a0Its work will culminate in a draft national action plan against racism for the consideration of Government. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the International Decade for People of African Descent\u00a0Steering Committee in Ireland to develop a programme of activities to celebrate the United Nation&rsquo;s International Decade for People of African Descent (IDPAD).\u00a0 This programme will promote the diverse heritage, culture and contribution of people of African descent to Irish communities.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In order to support integration on a national level, my Department administers a National Integration Fund, a three-year funding programme to promote initiatives to address areas where migrants find it difficult to avail of opportunities on an equal basis with other members of Irish society. Following a competitive funding call launched in August 2020, 18 successful projects located throughout Ireland were granted funding totalling almost &euro;2.2 million over the three year period.

The strategies include the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG), the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS), the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, the National LGBTI+ Strategy for Youth and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES).  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of each equality strategy is overseen by a steering committee which draws together State and non-State actors to deliver a better quality of life for all through targeted actions to promote social inclusion and improved access to public services.

As some of these strategies near their conclusion, I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over their term and how we can bring forth the next iterations of those strategies and ensure they are even more effective.\u00a0   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to examine the introduction of a new ground of discrimination, based on socio-economic disadvantaged status, to the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts.

In mid-October 2020 the transfer took place of the Governance function of IHREC from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department. IHREC is an independent body which publishes reports on an annual basis outlining cases relating to discrimination in which legal advice and\/or representation was provided by IHREC.\u00a0 It also produces research setting out experiences of discrimination experienced on the grounds encompassed by the equality legislation. \u00a0  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also represented\u00a0on committees at the EU and Council of Europe and at the UN and information gathered from those fora informs\u00a0the continuing work of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400059#WRG05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400059#WRG05500"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[6261\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400059#WRG05600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the degree to which he has been alerted to issues affecting children during the course of the Covid-19 crisis with particular reference to the need to prevent abuse and neglect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":412,"content":"<p>Thank you deputy for your question. You raise a most serious issue.<\/p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has continued to provide essential frontline services to children and families throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. \u00a0Tusla&rsquo;s work has focused on ensuring continuity of critical supports and services to vulnerable families \u00a0whilst \u00a0balancing this need with \u00a0public health advice to keep children, families and frontline staff as safe as possible during the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla determined that the three priority service areas within the organisation were:<\/p>  <p>  - Child Protection      (including Out of Hours Social Work Services)<\/p>  <p>  -\u00a0Children in Care      (including parental access and court hearings)<\/p>  <p>  -\u00a0Domestic and Sexual      Gender Based Violence services.<\/p>  <p>  When Covid-19 restrictions were first introduced, with schools closing in March 2020, referrals decreased \u00a0to child protection and welfare services. The decrease was \u00a0from an average of 1,505 per week, to 968 (36% decrease) per week for the initial four week period. Following a local and national media campaign referrals increased, to over 1,300 referrals per week. All indications are that year on year comparisons will show an increase in referrals received in 2020. The most recent monthly referral data shows to the end of October 2020 Tusla had received 52,082 referrals, over the same period in 2019 Tusla received 49,963 referrals already an increase of 4%. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In June 2020, my Department developed an information and media campaign entitled SupportingChildren.gov.ie. For the first time this brought together information on all the services, structures and supports which are in place for vulnerable children, young people and their families during the Covid pandemic.\u00a0Critically this also included\u00a0the range of step-up actions and innovations that were also being advanced to support these groups. I can inform you that this initiative is about to begin again. It is important that this vulnerable cohort of children and their families know that support continues to be available during these challenging times.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department established a Covid response group. Under the umbrella of this team the various facets of my Department keep me informed as to issues affecting children and young people and the impact of Covid-19. The group collates information on the impact of Covid on a variety of services including Tusla Children Residential services, the Oberstown Campus, Youth services, Domestic Sexual &amp;amp; Gender Based Violence services,\u00a0International Protection Accommodation Service, Traveller and Roma services. They also contribute to and monitor the responses put in place to mitigate issues that arise.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  You will be aware of the heightened concern for the safety of partners and children where there is domestic violence.\u00a0 The Department of Justice is coordinating a Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) group across \u00a0Departments and agencies to ensure a coordinated focussed approach to this worrying problem. Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBVIn Budget 2021, myDepartment negotiated an additional &euro;30m for Tusla, specifically allocated for DSGBV services. This includes core funding of &euro;28m and an additional &euro;2m to assist DSGBV organisations in offsetting the effects of COVID-19 on day-to-day services.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments regarding DSGBV, including an audit on segmentation of DSGBV responsibilities across government departments and agencies, which will inform future investments in this area. Tusla is also undertaking a review of emergency accommodation nationwide. This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. Substantial progress has been made on a number of processes which contribute to the review, including a literature review, consultations with stakeholders, geographical and census data analysis, consultation with service users and policy analysis. The review's findings and the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee of the Second National Strategy on DSGBV will inform Tusla's future decisions on priority areas for investment and development of services. Tusla has advised me that the report will be published this April.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible, including children.<\/p>  <p>  In addition through correspondences and parliamentary queries submitted to my Department, issues affecting children and opportunities to prevent abuse and neglect are brought to the fore. During a crisis such as we face now, if anyone has a concern for the safety and welfare of a child or young person they should bring it to the attention of the appropriate authorities without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400059#WRG05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[6262\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400059#WRG05900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the extent of his Department&rsquo;s interaction with various youth organisations throughout the country with particular reference to the need to offer support to youth organisations and the protection of the vulnerable in the context of the Covid-19 crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>My officials and I have a very good working relationship with the youth sector and I will be continuing this engagement as we seek to support young people through this very challenging period. \u00a0Of particular relevance in the context of the Deputy's query is the very successful working group convened by my officials to work with youth sector representatives in the context of the response to the Covid pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the vital role played by youth work in providing support to young people, funding levels have increased\u00a0throughout the current challenging period.\u00a0This has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Early in my tenure, I was able to provide an additional small grant to support local funded organisations, Youth Information Centres and youth clubs to defray some of the Covid-19 costs.

The expansion of higher education has been a key enabling factor in the growth of the Irish economy over the past four decades. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation. Equally, increased participation in higher education has resulted in significant contributions to society and has played a critical role in enriching our cultural life. <\/p>  <p>  There are\u00a0a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands.

The enterprise sector provides quality employment which is important for our standard of living and inclusivity.<\/p>  <p>  The enterprise sector is hugely important in driving innovation in this country. Almost 75% of all Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) expenditure in Ireland is by private enterprises. Our most recent figures show that &euro;2.77 billion was invested in RDI by enterprises in Ireland in 2017, a 24% increase from 2015 and the largest biennial increase in 10 years. These investments have been instrumental in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and growth in the past decade, and will continue to be of critical importance as we face our current and future challenges.<\/p>  <p>  Productivity is the primary determinant of long-term growth. Investment in knowledge-based capital, and innovation in particular, drives productivity through new, higher value-added products and services, and more efficient business processes. The value of services in the Irish economy exceeds that of manufacturing, and consequently investment in knowledge-based capital is increasingly important for driving future economic growth. This economic reality means that Ireland must be among the top-ranked nations for innovation if it is to realise its potential.<\/p>  <p>  To that end, my department officials and I have worked to continue to foster and develop existing links with the enterprise sector. We have been engaging with various stakeholders including business groups and companies, and have received their inputs into my department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy, which is due to be published shortly. Maintaining links with enterprise &ndash; both indigenous and FDI &ndash; ensures we can keep up to date with domestic needs and global trends. <\/p>  <p>  I have attended several constructive meetings with industry leaders in recent weeks and will continue to work with them in driving Ireland&rsquo;s vision to become a Global Innovation Leader. We also closely liaise with our colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies to ensure a consistent approach in aiding the enterprise sector to increase its innovative activities.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s agency SFI has developed a suite of dynamic funding programmes which facilitate industry\/academic collaboration. These funding programmes enable companies and academics to work together on specific programmes of research to address industry needs, support technology transfer and grow skills and expertise. Developing its industry facing programmes to deliver significant public\/private partnership, increase collaboration, support FDI and engage SMEs in research and innovation across all sectors will continue to be a priority for the agency as it embeds within my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The manufacturing sector is one in which SFI has already made significant investments which involve industry participation. One of those investments is CONFIRM, the SFI Research Centre for Smart Manufacturing. The Centre very recently opened its new, cutting edge headquarters in Limerick. This facility includes a testbed to house Ireland&rsquo;s future factory demonstrators, an innovative virtual reality cave, 10 Gbps internet access, Ireland&rsquo;s first private 5G digital manufacturing network and a digital manufacturing lab with 3D printing and non-contact 3D part-scanning facilities. The headquarters will be a space for industry to come together with academic researchers. It is a significant milestone &ndash; heightening Ireland&rsquo;s position as a leader in smart manufacturing.<\/p>  <p>  Other significant investments in the manufacturing area include IFORM, the SFI Research Centre in Advanced Manufacturing. Like CONFIRM, IFORM is a world leading SFI Research Centre with deep industry collaboration and co-investment. IFORM is delivering the next level of understanding and control for complex manufacturing processes. Ireland is already recognised as having one of the most advanced manufacturing sectors in Europe. These, along with other investments by SFI will support Ireland to become the leading digital manufacturing powerhouse globally.<\/p>  <p>  Access to highly skilled graduates is a critical success factor for businesses in Ireland. SFI has established six SFI Centres for Research Training. These Centres will support advanced skills and training (PhDs) in collaboration with industry, for the new economy. The six current SFI Centres for Research Training support over 700 PhD students in ICT and Data Analytics. Future skills can be addressed through further development of this programme in other areas, including Innovation in Business Services and Advanced Manufacturing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400060#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":455,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 166 and 167 answered with Question No. 163.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400060#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[6279\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020400060#WRH03550","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that the second and third level education system in Ireland remains sufficiently open to the encouragement of the highest possible level of expertise, efficiency and competitiveness in the global context; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. At present, the HSE has been able to provide adequate PCR testing for identified priorities in response to the very significant demand.<\/p>  <p>  While rapid Antigen Detection Tests (ADTs) are described as rapid, and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers and there are considerable human resource, operational, quality assurance, and clinical governance considerations in their administration. To date, validation work indicates that ADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population. Validation studies, both here in Ireland and in Europe are showing significant disparities in test performance (particularly in relation to sensitivity) versus some manufacturer claims, with tests not meeting minimum performance requirements set by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Furthermore, their intended use is typically in symptomatic individuals in the early stages of infection, where samples are taken and tests conducted by trained health professionals. There is limited performance data currently available for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic populations. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic individuals is much better than in asymptomatic individuals where data are available. <\/p>  <p>  The NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) considers the use of ADTs on an ongoing basis and has endorsed recommendations on the use of ADTs that have been validated as a supplement to PCR testing in certain situations, and particularly when the availability of PCR tests may be limited.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently putting in place deployment options for the use of ADTs for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.<\/p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population.

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. <\/p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented. In December 2013 the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established as a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The opening of the National Rare Disease Office, (NRDO) in 2015 was a significant milestone for people living with a rare disease, their families and their healthcare professionals.\u00a0 Prof Eileen Treacy is the Director of the National Rare Diseases Office, whose purpose it is to provide current and reliable information about genetic and rare diseases to patients, families and healthcare professionals. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of the HSE Chief Clinical Officer&rsquo;s (CCO), review of all the national clinical programmes in April 2019, it was recommended that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases be operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. From 01 September 2020, the NRDO has become the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. In line with Slaintecare proposals and the National Model of Care for Rare Diseases 2020, The National Rare Disease Office have plans to implement integrated care pathways for all rare diseases.
