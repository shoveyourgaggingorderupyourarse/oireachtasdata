I ask him to imagine a situation where the Leas-Chathaoirleach was arrested and put in prison for two years and was then sentenced to 11 and a half years for the crime of arranging a parliamentary debate.  This is what has happened to the speaker of the Catalan Parliament.  We all know the history of what has happened over the past couple of years and how the Catalan people voted in their millions for independence on 1 October 2017.  We were all shocked at the scenes of Spanish state police brutally destroying polling booths and hitting elderly frail people.  My party had four witnesses who saw that first hand.<\/p> <p>After that shocking display of state violence and repression, a number of Catalan leaders were put in pre-trial detention.  We heard on Monday how nine of them have been sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison.  The former speaker, Ms Carme Forcadell, faces 11 and a half years in jail for allowing a debate on Catalan independence in parliament.  The former vice president, the equivalent of our T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Oriol Junqueras, faces 13 years for peacefully seeking independence for his nation.  Several ministers have been sentenced to at least nine years.  We now have a new warrant for Carles Puigdemont, who has been living in exile for the past few years, as are others who have been involved.  The Spanish state has tried to have them arrested and extradited but it keeps losing these cases because the charges they face have no basis.  They are ridiculous charges of sedition and rebellion.<\/p> <p>The European Union is supposed to stand for certain important values, such as democracy, freedom and human rights.

How can it have any credibility to speak about freedom, dignity and human rights when it turns its backs on the Catalan people and this horrific repression?<\/p><p>The Minister of State is standing in for another Minister today, but I hope that he will agree that dialogue is the way forward.  Currently, we are consumed by Brexit and are hopeful of a good outcome.  That hope is based on dialogue.  The Spanish state has set its face against dialogue and has set itself on a course of imprisonment and repression of the Catalan people.  Where is our Government in all of this?  What message can the Minister of State give to the people of Catalonia?  What message speaking of human rights and freedom can we hear from him?  It would mean much to the Catalan people if he were to acknowledge that dialogue must be the way forward.

The home help scheme is under pressure.  As the Minister of State will be aware, two weeks ago the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>reported a harrowing story regarding a 70 year old woman who spent 105 hours on a trolley in Limerick hospital and her family's expressed fears that she would die if a fire started.  This is the direct result of a lack of investment in home help hours and step-down nursing support facilities.  The HSE figures reveal that 79 patients have been stuck in public beds for six months due to a lack of step-down facilities and home help hours; by mid-September 745 patients had not been discharged despite being medically fit, which is staggering, and that over 1,000 people were added to the home help waiting list in the last four months, with the waiting list now at 7,300.<\/p><p>As recently as the last two weeks, local Councillor Joe Flaherty and I met representatives of a newly-formed carers group in County Longford who passionately articulated the frustration of carers, their families and the wider community.  The system is broken and the patients and their loved ones are paying the price.  The group provided me with details of several cases where additional hours have been approved but the families have been told the additional hours cannot be commenced before Christmas owing to an embargo.  The hours have been approved but they are not being provided which, in the main, is the issue.  <\/p><p>There are two distinct groups of carers in crisis.  There are patients who have access to family carers and patients who do not have families to care for them.  The latter cohort is the worst affected as in many cases they receive no care.  We routinely hear, as I do in my practice, of patients left soiled or lying on a floor, perhaps unconscious or with a broken limb after a fall, until such time as a neighbour or a good samaritan calls to the House.  In regard to family carers, the real risk for them is the absence of an effective home care structure and, subsequently, family burn-out which, in turn, leads to further illness in the home and additional expense on the system rather than a saving.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Keith Swanick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These families are tired, frustrated, upset and disillusioned with a system that has failed them.  The most troublesome and worrying trend about which the new carers' advocacy group told me was that they had been warned not to complain or their existing hours would be cut.  It has reached the stage where many carers are afraid to speak out.  If that is true, it is a fundamental injustice and extremely worrying.  I seek clarification on the matter from the Minister of State.  <\/p><p>There is a clear and obvious need for an advocacy group for family carers, independent of the HSE.  It should be positioned to articulate and champion their concerns.  As I mentioned, I met the group in Longford two weeks ago.  I met a woman by the name of Majella Meade who has been battling illness since 2014.  She tried to balance her recovery with her work in caring for her patients.  However, the toll was too much and she had to give up the job she loved.  Sadly, her father passed away in May this year but not before living an additional 18 months with his family.  The priceless extra time was thanks to the care and love of his family.  The health of Majella's mother, Mary Jane Meade, deteriorated after her husband's death.  She has vascular dementia and requires full-time care and supervision in the home.  The family has a carer who calls for one hour each day, five days a week.  If Majella wants to go to the shop or see the doctor because she has her own health needs, she has to rely on a neighbour to help.  The community nurse in Longford has provided great support for the family.  <\/p><p>The family have been assessed and it was proposed that they receive three calls per day and two over the weekend, but that has not happened.  If it had, it would have meant a major improvement.  However, the family heard that there was an embargo on extra hours and, therefore, a delay because of budget overruns and overspending on the national children's hospital.  We need to ensure that once hours are allocated, they are honoured and that people receive the care they need.  There is a shortfall in the number of carers, but we need to ensure the qualifications of carers are up to speed.  The most important point on which I need clarification concerns families being threatened with the loss of hours if they do not put up and shut up.  If that is true, it is a disgrace.  We need clarification on that matter and perhaps an investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#D00400","speaker":"1373","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I will respond to some of the issues raised and also follow up on them.  I share the Senator's views on the valuable work carers do in our society.  Home supports enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities, as well as facilitating timely discharge from hospital.  The Government has made investment in home support services a priority.  Progress in this area is reflected in the additional funding made available in recent years, with the budget growing from &euro;306 million in 2015 to nearly &euro;446 million in 2019.  More than 50,000 people benefit from this service at any one time.  As outlined in its national service plan for 2019, the HSE maximises the utilisation of current resources.  It prioritises those who require discharge from acute hospitals.  Significant resources and services in 2019 have been targeted to facilitate timely egress.<\/p> <p>In winter 2018-19 the focus was on reducing the number of delayed patient discharges through mobilising the additional resources made available and ensuring social care measures were deployed effectively to enable older people to move to a more appropriate care setting, including step-down or transitional care in their own home, with the requisite supports.  <\/p> <p>When talking about home support, we must also recognise the support provided for people with a disability.  That area is part of my portfolio.  The HSE is fully committed to maximising the provision of health and personal social care services for people with disabilities, including home support services, within available resources, empowering them to live independent lives.  In its national service plan for 2020 the HSE expects to deliver 3.08 million home support hours to more than 8,000 people with a disability.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is an increase of 150,000 hours on last year's target.  Therefore, it is a significant investment.  I also acknowledge that in some cases access to home support services may take longer than we would like.  However, the HSE has assured the Department that people on the waiting list are reviewed as funding becomes available to ensure individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local line staff who know and understand the client's needs and undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure the services being provided remain appropriate.<\/p><p>The HSE welcomes and encourages feedback from its clients on home support delivery.  I emphasise that it is not HSE policy that a client's existing level of service be reduced on receiving a complaint.  If a client's needs change, the client or the carer can request a review by contacting the local health office.  In line with the commitments given in the programme for Government, we have made improved access to home support services a priority in budget 2020.  An additional investment of &euro;52 million is being made in 2020 which will support the provision of over 19.2 million hours of home support.  That is 1 million hours more than the 2019 target and represents a substantial increase in service provision.<\/p><p>While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of citizens.  The Department of Health is developing plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation of home support services for older people and adults with a disability.  Included in the investment is dedicated funding for the testing of the new statutory home support scheme in 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#E00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I appreciate what the Minister of State said about the figure of &euro;446 million and the 50,000 people who are benefiting from it.

That is something I will include in the follow-up on this matter.  While the home support service is delivering crucial support for many throughout the country, we accept that it has to be improved to meet the changing needs of citizens, including the complex needs mentioned by the Senator.  Because this is a debate I have in the disability sector, I like the way the Senator spoke about the two categories - family carers and those who do not have any family member at all.

I sincerely thank all those involved in that really fantastic event.  Professor Oonagh Walsh provided a really great insight into the history of the hospital and the hugely significant role the Connacht Asylum, or St. Brigid's Hospital, played in the development of the town and region after its opening in 1833.

It is important to say that the people of Ballinasloe are very proud of the role St. Brigid's Hospital played in supporting people and in the history of their town.  The current state of the premises, however, is of major concern to the people of the area.  It is against that backdrop that we need to work on repurposing these buildings and the land in order to see St. Brigid's campus once again become a key part of the economic development of the town and wider region.  That is a really important point in terms of its history.  St. Brigid's Hospital was important to the economic development of the town and wider region.  We need to now ensure that these buildings are brought back into use so that they can contribute to the economic development of the town and wider region.  <\/p> <p>Our immediate priority needs to be securing the old buildings.  As I have said, with each month that passes, their conditions deteriorate.  This will ultimately lead to higher restoration costs.  In the longer term, we need to have an achievable vision for the future of the campus.  We have a very good example in the redevelopment of the Grangegorman campus, of which I am sure the Minister of State is very aware.  We need to see a similar priority given to the St. Brigid's site.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#G00200","speaker":"1415"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the future plans for the site of St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe.  I also thank and commend the Senator for her work on health and disability issues more generally in the Seanad over recent years.  Over recent years, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has consolidated the services on the St. Brigid's Hospital site as part of the transition to community-based mental health services in line with A Vision for Change.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A development programme has focused on vacating the main building complex and developing fit-for-purpose facilities on lands adjacent to, but separate from, the main campus.  This has resulted in a significant portion of the St. Brigid's Hospital site and lands being surplus to HSE requirements.  Oak Grove House is the last building on the campus still in service but I understand that replacement purpose-built accommodation is currently being developed.  Once this last building is vacated, the HSE intends to proceed with the disposal of parts of the St. Brigid's Hospital site and lands that are surplus to requirements.<\/p><p>The HSE is a prescribed stakeholder under the protocol for the intra-State transfer of State property assets and the protocol for the intra-State sharing of property assets, as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  These protocols set out three options for disposal of assets: the transfer to another public body or State agency; open market sale, subject to favourable market conditions; or other uses such as community and voluntary use will be considered only if points one and two do not materialise.<\/p><p>Any proposals for the disposal of surplus property assets must be considered in the context of the capital funding available to the Department of Health and Government policy relating to the use and management of State property assets.  In this context, the HSE is required to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets and the proceeds are reinvested in delivering much needed healthcare infrastructure.  In preparation for the disposal of the assets, in 2018 the HSE invited expressions of interest, together with business plans, from relevant State bodies, stakeholders and local authorities.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, requested an extension to the deadline in order to complete a report on the potential future use of St. Brigid's Hospital site and lands.  I understand the report has recently been completed and is currently being reviewed by the property management section of the OPW.  Pending the outcome from this process, the intention would be to develop a proposal and seek approval to proceed with the transfer or disposal of the asset, in line with State property protocols.<\/p><p>The use of the sales' proceeds from the disposal of St. Brigid's Hospital will be subject to sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It would be intended that the proceeds of the sale of this property will be invested in much needed mental health and other facilities in addition to the very significant Exchequer funding required to maintain and improve health infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#G00300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":29,"content":"<p><b>Senator Maura Hopkins:<\/b>I have a number of questions arising from the Minister of State's response.

Surely, the State should be trying to bring those buildings back into a place where they can support the economic development of the region.  I ask the Minister of State to raise it at Cabinet level that this is an important priority for our region.

The HSE has made a significant investment in community-based mental health services in the Ballinasloe area to facilitate the reconfiguration of services away from the acute setting of St. Brigid's Hospital, in line with A Vision for Change.  This has resulted in a significant portion of the site and lands being surplus to the requirements of the HSE.  Pending the outcome of engagements with the OPW on the potential future use of the site and lands, the intention is to proceed with the transfer or disposal of the asset in line with State property protocols.<\/p> <p>I take the Senator's point on the shift and the challenges with staff.  These are important issues.  I do not have the details on the timeframes but I will follow up with her.  She has raised important issues, particularly that of Oak Grove.  We need to see where we are going with that.  I need to get more clarification on that from the Department and the HSE.  Government policy, as set out in A Vision for Change, is that the proceeds from the sale of the older mental health assets, such as St. Brigid's Hospital, will be reinvested in new developments in the area of mental health.  That is important.  I understand the new replacement accommodation is being developed for the mental healthcare services previously provided on the St. Brigid's Hospital campus.<\/p> <p>Another important point the Senator raised, which has to be taken into consideration, is economic regeneration, particularly in the Ballinasloe area, and the repurposing of buildings.  These issues will be taken into consideration as well and we have to ensure this happens.  These developments are in line with the best international practice for the reorientation of assets from a hospital-based focus to the modern structures and facilities required for enhanced community-based service provision.  I will raise the issues the Senator mentioned about the site and the plans and timeframes for same with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Moran, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and officials from the OPW and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#J00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571146200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.12 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1571146200,"counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 - Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage, to be taken at 4.45 p.m. and to adjourn at 6.45 p.m., if not previously concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#N00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Mark Daly.

I thank the Leader for outlining the Order of Business today.<\/p> <p>At present, it is all things Brexit and Brexit-related.  I know the Government has made strong representations to the British Government on the court case yesterday.  The matter has been raised many times in this House by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, among others.  I refer to the entitlement in the Good Friday Agreement of every citizen on this island to identify as British or Irish, or both, as a person so chooses.  The verdict in yesterday's court case stated that one would automatically be a British citizen in Northern Ireland, whether one chose it or not.  That is not within the spirit and certainly not within the letter of the Good Friday Agreement.  The situation must be rectified.  Otherwise, those in Northern Ireland who would classify themselves as being Irish must go through a legal process to say that they are not, in fact, British.  When one puts it in the context of Brexit, it outlines the need for clarity to be brought to the issue because identity has been highlighted as one of the key concerns on both sides when it comes to the future of this island and a united Ireland, as Senator Norris and others have pointed out.  We must respect identity and make sure people are protected.  The court case and this ruling are of concern to everybody on this island and must be challenged.<\/p> <p>Brexit is ever with us.  We have had numerous debates on it.  In the past 15 minutes, the chief negotiator of the EU, Michel Barnier, has pointed out that the British proposals to leave the EU are simply not good enough.  He said they are not there yet.  He makes a good point when he says it is high time to turn good intentions into legal text.  He points out that it must be done by this evening in order to be ready for it to be ratified at the meetings of the Heads of State and of Government on Thursday and Friday.  There is also next week and there is also an opportunity for the UK to seek an extension, despite its domestic issues, in order for this to be done correctly, because when the UK leaves, it will do so permanently.  Moreover, it must also leave in a way that makes sure that the peace on this island is sustained and maintained.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As pointed out by the Chief Constable of the PSNI and others, we know that in the event of a return to a hard border, there will be a return to violence of this island.

I got a distress call this afternoon from University Hospital Limerick.  The Leader will know this is not the first time I have brought up the issue of the hospital.  There were 80 people on trolleys there this morning.  A month ago, the head of nursing declared to staff that having trolleys in corridors was a red-line issue for her, yet this morning she was forced to instruct the location of three trolleys on every corridor of the hospital.  Worse than that, the patient dispatch unit also has trolleys in its corridor.  My colleague, Ger Kennedy, from SIPTU, who asked to be quoted so people would understand the gravity of the situation, described University Hospital Limerick as akin to Beirut.  We have spoken about this on so many occasions.  Staff morale is at an all-time low.  This is really saying something.  God knows, the staff have had a hard time in the hospital in recent years.<\/p> <p>There is genuine despair over the lack of Government action and over the Government acting at times as a roadblock to progress.  I will give a specific example.  It was put to me this morning on the train as I came here.  There are a number of new nursing graduates, including seven midwife graduates.  There is a serious shortage of midwives across the country, particularly in University Maternity Hospital Limerick, yet the seven midwives are unemployed because the maternity hospital in Limerick does not have permission to hire them.  The Minister likes to play with terms.  He says there is no moratorium.  One can call it a pause or moratorium, or whatever one likes, but the fact of the matter is that our hospitals are in crisis and University Hospital Limerick is in no position to hire.  That decision rests with one person alone, the Minister for Health, the same Minister for Health who slipped in for one morning and slipped out again without telling anyone in advance what was happening.<\/p> <p>I see colleagues from the mid-west present.  To be fair to them, they have also highlighted the crisis in University Hospital Limerick.  I am acting not on a party-political basis but on the basis that we have had enough.  In Limerick, Clare and across the mid-west, we have had enough of our hospitals failing our people, of people dying in corridors and of the crisis getting ever worse.  Let us not forget it is only 14 October.  Limerick holds the record of 82 people on trolleys.  What will the record be in another month, December or January?  Is it any wonder that the Government is seeking a quick election?  It knows it will only get worse.  It is time for action.  How long will it take?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#O00800","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I am sorry I was not in my seat when my turn arrived.<\/p><p>I welcome two young men from Cork, namely, Ben Quigley and Adam Hallissey, both of whom are authors with <i>progressivebrief.com<\/i>.

I am unsure what way things will work out but listening and watching Sky News this morning, there is a possibility that there will have to be a change to the position that gave the unionists the level of comfort they think they currently have.  We must be extremely careful because there are young men and women in Northern Ireland who may not take that too well.  For that reason in particular, I compliment the Government in being extremely sensitive.  It is a very dangerous time in our history.  I ask that we maintain the level of secrecy, if one wishes to call it that, as we lead up to the final days of whatever will emerge.

We have raised it many times here.  I would not question the Minister's motivation in going to visit the hospital.  He was called on by people across the floor in both Houses to make an unannounced visit and he did that in good faith.  He did not tell anybody he was going because that would defeat the purpose.  A modular unit is being built as we speak.  The money has been provided.  There were no roadblocks in providing the money for the modular unit.  Within five weeks of it being requested by the Mid West hospital group, the money was sanctioned.  That will be a 60-bed unit.  It will not solve the problems.  I call for the 93-bed additional unit that has been committed to in the Project Ireland 2040 capital plan to be fast-tracked.  That would certainly alleviate the pressures in the hospital in Limerick.  We need to be mindful of the people who are on trolleys.  It is not acceptable.  I have great sympathy for them and for the staff who are working in those dreadful conditions.  All that we can do is call on management to escalate its discharge policy.  The slowness in discharging patients from the hospital into step-down facilities is a problem that needs to be dealt with.  The Government can only do so much.  I believe that the management in University Limerick hospital group needs to improve the flow of early and fast discharges, otherwise we will see a repeat of the current situation.  I accept that it is only part of the problem and that capacity is another significant part.  A solution to that capacity problem is on the way, which I consider a partial solution.  The ultimate solution is a 60-bed modular unit coupled with the 93-bed unit that is committed to under the capital investment programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#P01400","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I would like to talk about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The book would record the stories of every man, woman and child killed during the Troubles, a book that would stand in isolation as the only record of the fate of every one of the 3,700 lives destroyed by the Troubles, including Members of this House and victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  It took an arduous and painstaking eight years to complete the task and in 1999 they duly published their work, <i>Lost Lives<\/i>, as a testament to remember those individuals, every man, woman, child and baby, lest they were forgotten.<\/p><p>The impact this book had was monumental.  It included revelations to many families regarding the loss of a loved one, details and circumstances that many had never been aware of.  The book has been read and referenced by academics and students, it has been shared and studied in churches and chapels, with many readers moved to tears by the sheer scale and loss of human life and families destroyed by the horrors of conflict.<\/p><p>However, that is not why I speak today.  Last night I attended the Queens Film Theatre in Belfast to watch &quot;Lost Lives&quot;, the film, 20 years on from the book.  A film best described as &quot;a requiem for those killed in the Troubles&quot;.  The film is the work of Belfast directors, Dermot Lavery and Michael Hewitt of DoubleBand Films.  For 90 minutes, it weaves together an intricate tapestry of archive footage, music and powerful visual imagery to a backdrop of bombs, gunfire, devastation and destruction.<\/p><p>Probably most strikingly and hauntingly, the voices behind the narrative are not the victims but rather a who's who of Irish acting talent.  Apparently none needed to be asked twice to participate.  All were willing participants, no doubt seeing the value of this work.  They make up a list comprising household names such as Liam Neeson, Kenneth Branagh, Adrian Dunbar, Bronagh Gallagher, Stephen Rea, James Nesbitt, Brendan Gleeson, Roma Downey, Susan Lynch, Martin McCann, Ian McElhinney, Michael Smiley, Bronagh Waugh and Br&iacute;d Brennan, all lending their voices to the stories of the lost lives, accompanied by a very moving, emotive score performed by the Ulster Orchestra.<\/p><p>What it demonstrates is the futility of conflict; the hurt, the pain, the loss and suffering of conflict.  It is a recognition and a stark reminder that there are no winners, only losers.  No one escapes the horror, no one has a monopoly on pain and no one should ever forget because its by remembering the hell that we all have a responsibility to ensure this never happens again.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ian Marshall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2486\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2486&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Probably the most the most moving moment was at the end credits when every Troubles death is listed year by year on screen, name after name, line after line, concluding with the single name in 2019, of Lyra McKee, murdered by dissident republicans earlier this year.  The list is a truly horrifying demonstration of the monumental loss of life.  As the credits finished and the lights went up, last night was the first time in my life that I left a cinema when absolutely no one spoke.  Not a word was being uttered, highlighting the power of this film, and the painful emotions and memories it evoked.  It reminded me of a funeral cortege or that silence associated with the respect and reverence of remembrance. <\/p><p>This film is a very important piece of work.  It premiered at the London Film Festival last week and at Queen's Film Theatre, Belfast from Friday, 10 October.  It is planned that \"Lost Lives\" will be screened by the BBC later this year.  I urge that this film should be seen across the Twenty-six Counties and not just the Six Counties.  Someone needs to make sure people can see it.  It should be screened in order that we all reflect, and that we all dispel any notion that this was a proud or glorious moment in our history on the island of Ireland because it certainly was not.<\/p><p>The pain and hurt etched on the faces and families destroyed by grief and suffering in this film should serve as a reminder that we never glorify this or go back to these horrors.  Everybody on the island needs to view this piece of genius.  Everybody needs to ensure these horrors never happen again.  I urge the Leader and this House to use their influence to ensure everyone has the opportunity to see this work and to understand that we never veer into idle chat about identity, culture and nationality in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland without understanding the hell and hurt so many have suffered.  All need to see this work, because we all have a responsibility to never repeat the past especially in these turbulent political times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#R04200","speaker":"1439","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>The report in today's newspaper about University Hospital Limerick makes very stark reading.  I have had contact from people who were there as patients in the past 24 hours and from staff.  Eighty people are on trolleys and it reached a national all-time high of 82 in the past month.  It is frightening to think that we are not into the winter months and yet 80 people are on trolleys.<\/p> <p>A person with a family member who is very seriously ill contacted my office.

We must always remember the horror inflicted on our people in those dark days from the late 1960s through to the Good Friday Agreement, not forgetting the tragic loss of Lyra McKee who was murdered this year.  Peace is fragile.  We must remember that one of the central tenets of the Good Friday Agreement and one of the things that will make sure we will never return to those dark days is recognising the right of all individuals to their identity as British, Irish or both.  As a consequence of a judgment by the British Home Office yesterday, the right of Emma DeSouza to be Irish and have her Irish identity recognised by the British state was not upheld.  This afternoon the Taoiseach recognised her as an Irish citizen and somebody who has, as a matter of fact, an Irish passport.  He has said the issue will be raised again by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, in meetings with the British authorities and Ministers this week.  With respect, tea and sympathy are not what is required.  We need strong action by the British Government to make sure that, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the right of citizens in the North to identify as Irish will be protected, as is the right to be considered British, and that they will have the full protection of the law in that respect.<\/p><p>I agree with the statement made by my colleague Senator Norris on the behaviour of the Turkish regime towards the Kurdish population in northern Syria.  It is absolutely outrageous and unacceptable.  The Kurdish people are among the most tormented of races on the planet and this has been the case since time immemorial.  The actions of Turkey must be condemned by the House.  I know many Turkish people living in Ireland who are good friends of mine, who do not accept what is happening and who find themselves at odds with the decision made by the Erdoan Government to engage in these horrific and reprehensible acts which do not reflect the wishes of the Turkish people I know who want to live in peace and respect the rights of the Kurdish people.  We know that this genie was allowed to emerge from the bottle by the actions of the US President, Donald Trump.  It is entirely unacceptable.  I support the proposal of my colleague Senator Norris that we protest to the Turkish ambassador about the behaviour of the Turkish regime in what is happening in northern Syria.  It is absolutely unacceptable and should be deplored by everybody in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#S00300","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I second Senator Nash's amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>This morning I attended a presentation made by Senator Freeman in the AV room on the Children's Digital Protection Bill which we discussed last year and has reached Committee Stage.

People can go on the dark web to get step-by-step instructions every day for 50 days on how to self-harm.  At the end of the 50 days they will be told how to complete suicide.  This is affecting young children aged ten years and younger.  We are still in mental health and well-being week.  These online forums are seen as normal.  It is seen as normal behaviour to be promoted, but it is so damaging.  Some sadistic individuals are capturing young children and, after 50 days of induction, asking them to complete suicide.

It is the best historical journalism that this country has ever seen.  It shows that there are human stories behind the statistics.  It is a book of remembrance and one that I have taken out of the Oireachtas Library many times.  Seemingly, buying the book would cost between &euro;200 and &euro;400.  However, I would tell students, public servants, politicians or anyone else to take out the book.  If we do not remember our past, we will be doomed to fail in future.

The UK Government has been told to submit by midnight proposals to replace the backstop or else the deal will be off.  I was delighted by what happened with Prime Minister Johnson and the Taoiseach last week, as the situation is moving in the right direction.  It is a pathway that could allow the UK to leave the EU without crashing out.  What we have always said is that we must avoid a hard border and protect our place in the Single Market.  Most importantly, the Good Friday Agreement can never be touched or threatened.  I hope that, in the coming days, we will devise a proposal and work together so that, whatever happens with Brexit, the agreement will work again.<\/p><p>Brexit has damaged relations on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and the EU and the UK.

I believe he stated that, by the end of the year, he would be down to eight patrol cars to cover his division.  He outlined that he had a serious problem and stated that, when he picked up the phone to look for help, he was told that there was no money.<\/p><p>I wish to raise two issues relating to the farming community.  Today is the final date for the spreading of slurry.  The deadline needs to be extended to accommodate those farmers who are trying to put slurry on their lands.  There has been an exceptional period of heavy rain, so much so that lands across the country are impassable to machinery.  In some cases, it is not even possible to have livestock out on lands.  I understand that many farmers throughout the country have been forced to house cattle because of the ground conditions.  The farming community needs the deadline to be extended.  I have written to the Minister expressing that sentiment and I hope that the Leader will use his good offices to implore the Minister to extend the deadline.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The other issue relates to the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, which is the &euro;100 million fund introduced by Government to compensate hard hit suckler farmers in regard to beef prices.  I was disappointed but not surprised to learn that only half the suckler farmers in the country have applied for this scheme.  This illustrates that the scheme is not working and is not attractive to farmers in the first instance.  The problem, in part, is that one of the criteria pertaining to this scheme is that farmers must commit to a reduction in their stocking numbers by a minimum of 5% for the following year.  The lack of uptake in the scheme highlights that there is a problem with it.  Again, I implore the Leader to use his good offices to bring back to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, the message that suckler farmers are hard pressed with beef prices and ground conditions and they need a break.  The Minister needs to review this scheme with a view to making it attractive for farmers to apply for the funding which they so badly need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#U00300","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the 12 Senators who contributed to the Order of Business.  The issues of Brexit and the DeSouza case were raised by Senators Daly, Craughwell, Conway, Nash and Feighan.  All of us in this House stand united in the twin declaration of the need to ensure there is no return to a hard border on our island and to protect our place in the Single Market.  Rather than add to the rhetoric, as parliamentarians it is best that we allow the negotiations to continue such that a deal and a solution can be found in the interests of all of us on this shared island.  <\/p> <p>The Taoiseach referenced the DeSouza case and he said that he will raise the matter with Prime Minister Johnson again next week.  It is an important case.  In my opinion, it goes against the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and it gives further hostage to different sides to argue particular points.  The important point is that British citizenship laws are, as the Taoiseach said, out of step with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  In keeping with the comments of many Members here, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, there is a responsibility on both sides to honour and uphold it.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, as part of their engagements, will make that position clear.  To make a distinction between national identity and citizenship is an incorrect reading of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>In regard to Brexit, the comments today by Mr. Barnier are worth noting.

All Members have raised this matter repeatedly in the House.  As Senator Gavan knows the Government is committed under the capital plan to the 60-bed modular unit.  We all understand that one person on a trolley is one too many.  There is a need for management and the HSE to come together to put in place a real plan that will eliminate the use of trolleys.  Equally, there is a role for the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and SIPTU in regard to the operation of emergency departments and trolley counts, including what counts and does not count.

The vacuum being created by the policy of the American Administration is being filled by Russia and Assad.  It is unacceptable.  The geopolitical landscape has changed in the space of a week because of the policy of the American Administration.

While I do not wish to engage in political crossfire with the Senators opposite me, they have a very short memory.  It was their party, when it was in power, that closed Templemore Garda College, reduced Garda numbers, failed to fill vacancies, put a moratorium in place on recruitment, hiring and promotion and cut the pay and conditions of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is their legacy.  Under this Government, new members of the Garda have been recruited, the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by &euro;190 million to include funding for 700 new garda&iacute; and additional staff.  Moreover, civilianisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken place, meaning that more garda&iacute; are out in the community.  Senator Gallagher may shake his head with disbelief but I will bring him to Cork to meet the garda&iacute; who are now in community policing.

If we do nothing else as a result of today's Order of Business, we could reflect on the contributions of Members who spoke about the film based on the book.  We can never go back to the dark days of the past.  We have a hard won peace.  It is fragile and we can never take it for granted.  We must always remember.  As Senator Marshall eloquently said, nobody escapes the pain and nobody has a monopoly on pain, but we can never allow this to happen again.  I endorse the view that the film should be essential viewing for all members of society.  I commend the Senators on that.<\/p> <p>In response to Senator Devine, the Committee Stage debate on Senator Freeman's Bill will take place tomorrow.  Some of the amendments from the Government seek to ensure that children are safeguarded.  I hope we can work together to make the Bill better so we can achieve its overarching aim, which is to protect and safeguard children.  Some of the points the Senator made today relate to challenges many parents face every day in how they deal with and have interactions with their children on the use of the Internet, social media and particular websites.  The points she made are important.  I was unable to attend the briefing earlier, but a member of my staff was there.  We can never be complacent about this important issue.  The debate will be held in the House tomorrow.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the spreading of slurry.

By accepting my amendment No. 4, the Minister has given some regard to my argument and he has also introduced the issue of biodiversity.  There was not the same period of consultation and research for blanket bogs and they have not undergone the same process.  Blanket bogs, a particularly vulnerable environment, were introduced at the last Stage in the D&aacute;il, effectively doubling the remit of the Bill.  This meant that a whole new ecosystem was brought into the realm of the Bill, affecting things like designation and dedesignation procedures which we will talk about shortly.<\/p><p>This is a final appeal to the Minister to accept amendment No. 9 and further amendments which will narrow the scope of the Bill specifically to raised bogs and will allow for better and more up-to-date legislation.  This would be preceded by appropriate consultation and scientific research processes on blanket bogs.  If we have a Bill on apples it would not make sense to throw oranges in at the last minute.  This is another issue which was added to a Bill that was designed for one particular environment.  The debate has moved on since Fianna F&aacute;il made the case for the inclusion of blanket bogs, to which the current Minister agreed.  Our understanding of peatlands has moved on and is reflected in some aspects of the Government's narrative around the budget in terms of rewetting and increasing employment in bog restoration under just transition.  The future for peatlands in Ireland is going to be more in the area of restoration than resource exploitation.  I urge the Minister to narrow the focus of the Bill to produce fit-for-purpose legislation in respect of blanket bogs in the future, instead of the awkward stretch we have at the moment.

All of the processes &ndash; the consultation, the consideration of our European obligations and so forth &ndash; concern proposals that arise from a review.  They do not precede a review.  In effect, the Minister of State is saying that if a review is conducted that comes up with proposals for the de-designation of a natural heritage area, including both raised and blanket bogs, then there would be public consultation.  My point is that it is not really the same as what happened to raised bogs in that the consultation and research was not in consideration of a specific proposal on the designation or de-designation of specific natural heritage areas.  There were overall scientific conversations, audits and public consultations regarding raised bogs, as to what our public policy should be in that area and, for example, if de-designation should even be a consideration in respect of raised bogs.  We looked at what factors should be considered in de-designation and in generating a proposal for de-designation.<\/p> <p>While I said the issues the Minister of State has identified were not addressed, he is correct to say they do come into play, but they do so in response to a proposal for designation or de-designation.  As the Minister of State correctly said, there is no obligation on a Minister to have a blanket bog review.  It is something a Minister may do.  Again, it is a little akin to putting the cart before the horse.  We should have an overall national audit of blanket bogs and consider how they fit into all our different national strategies and then consider the appropriate policy proposals in respect of them, rather than what we have here, which is simply that a specific proposal on the designation or de-designation of a specific blanket bog may go to a public consultation.  It is not the same.

My amendment provides that in assessing environmental factors in regard to our boglands and selected bog habitats, account be taken of carbon sequestration, biodiversity and the role of our bogs in pollination and in adhering to the all-island pollinator plan.  I am proposing that these are issues into which a Minister may wish to conduct a review.  As I said, some of this is incorporated into amendment No. 11 and I would like to be in a position to withdraw my amendment and support the Minister of State's proposal.  However, the problem is that as well as incorporating my amendment in respect of carbon, pollination and biodiversity, he has also inserted a concerning new proposal that recreational and sporting needs may be a factor for consideration in designating or, more relevantly, de-designating an area of natural heritage.  It is a real concern that a natural heritage area might be de-designated for the provision of, for example, a golf course.  While amendment No. 11 refers to greenways, the provision does not relate exclusively to greenways but leaves open the possibility of any type of recreational or sporting use being applied.  We will deal later with the fact that there is no definition in the Bill of which recreational and sporting needs might constitute a factor in making decisions as to the designation or de-designation of a natural heritage area.<\/p><p>To reiterate, I recognise that the Minister of State has come a little distance in amendment No. 11 in meeting the concerns addressed in amendment No. 10.  Unfortunately, I cannot support his amendment because, as well as introducing the provision regarding sporting or recreational use, it retains the two fundamental flaws in the relevant section of the Bill.  They are the same core flaws addressed in my amendments Nos. 13 and 14.  First is the matter of the overreach in the Bill whereby it incorporates blanket bogs as well as raised bogs, which I addressed at length in reference to amendment No. 9.  The second issue relates to the grounds on which a protected area may be de-designated.  In order to designate a natural heritage area, there must be regard to section 16(6) of the Wildlife Act, which contains a comprehensive list of evidence-based considerations relating to the scientific environment, habitat, species and geology.  However, the same bar does not apply when it comes to a decision to de-designate, with no reference to the range of scientific considerations and criteria set out in section 16(6).  Instead, there is a new reference to &quot;environmental criteria&quot;, which are problematically defined later in the Bill and effectively amount simply to a comparison of whether one bog is better or worse than another bog.  That is more or less what is proposed as the key environmental criterion.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to environmental considerations, EU directives and so on, but they are not part of the de-designation review.  Rather, they are issues the Minister may choose to consider after a review has taken place.  Under section 3 of the Bill, the Minister conducts a review, after which, under section 4, he or she considers various issues and holds public consultations on the proposals arising out of the review.  I am seeking in my amendments to improve the review process and ensure there is consistency.  Amendment No. 14 simply provides that any de-designation of a protected area should be decided in accordance with the same standard as applies in respect of a designation.  Amendment No. 13 addresses the issue of overreach in respect of raised bogs.  We have a last chance to fix this issue.  Accepting amendment No. 13 would remove blanket bogs from the Bill and ensure that the de-designation process applies only to raised bogs.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 12 is consequential on amendment No. 10.  One of the reasons that I cannot support amendment No. 11 is that amendments Nos. 13 and 14 will fall if the Minister of State's amendment is passed.  He and I are overlapping a little in what we are seeking to do here but, more broadly, we are contrary in our intent.  I appeal to the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 10 and address either or both of the core issues of overreach and inconsistency by accepting either or both amendments Nos. 13 and 14.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#GG00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Does Senator Higgins have a seconder for her amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#GG00300","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I second amendment No. 10.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#GG00400","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>My amendment No. 11 provides that a review of natural heritage areas will take into account the carbon sequestration potential of bog habitats and the actions relevant to bog habitats contained in a national plan or plan for the island of Ireland concerning reversing pollinator decline.

Functioning peatlands capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation.  The all-Ireland pollinator plan for 2015 to 2020 includes a strategy to address pollinator decline and protect pollination services on the island of Ireland.  It was developed by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and is supported by a wide range of stakeholders North and South, including my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Heritage Council and public bodies in Northern Ireland.

The amendment provides that the purposes of a review of the natural heritage area will take into account the \"carbon sequestration potential of bog habitats and [...] actions, relevant to bog habitats, contained in a national plan or [...] plan for the island of Ireland for the time being concerning the reversal of pollinator decline\", as well as the nature conservation objectives of maintaining bog habitats at, or restoring bog habitats to, a favourable conservation status, as already provided for in the Bill.  Functioning peatlands, including restored peatlands, capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation.  The all-Ireland pollinator plan includes a strategy to address pollinator decline and protect pollination services on the island of Ireland.  It is therefore considered appropriate to include these matters within a review of the natural heritage area, while at the same time allowing for the most degraded peatlands, with little or no restoration potential, to be taken out of the natural heritage area network.  <\/p><p>The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 strikes a balance between the needs to maintain or restore bog habitats to a favourable conservation status, to live up our EU obligations, and to work with landowners and turf cutters.  Bearing this in mind, there may be grounds for amending the boundary of a natural heritage area site to exclude appropriate recreational or sporting facilities, so long as areas of active bog habitat within a site can be maintained and areas of degraded bog habitat can be restored.  There may also be opportunities to develop recreational facilities, such as walking routes or greenways, within natural heritage areas, building upon existing routes within these sites.  Local communities are already working with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department in this regard in respect of a number of protected raised bog sites.  I have also ensured that any regard to recreational and sporting needs appropriate to bog habitats in a review of natural heritage areas will be subject to a strategic environmental assessment, including public consultation and the carrying out of any other screening for an assessment or, as the case may be, assessment if required.  <\/p><p>On the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the amendment does not refer to the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan 2015-2020 but to \"a national plan or, as the case may be, plan for the island of Ireland for the time being concerning the reversal of pollinator decline\".  I emphasise that the purpose of a review of natural heritage areas, NHAs, would include contributing to the achievement of nature conservation objectives for bog habitats by selecting the most suitable bog habitats to be designated or to cease to be designated using the criteria provided for in the Bill and taking into account the carbon sequestration potential of bog habitats and actions relevant to bog habitats contained in a national plan or, as the case may be, plan for the island of Ireland for the time being concerning the reversal of pollinator decline, as provided for in the amendment.  These would all be components of any review of bog habitats.  <\/p><p>In any NHA review, including the 2014 NHA review of raised bogs, which is to be completed, a strategic environmental assessment must be undertaken and public consultation as well as, for example, a screening for an appropriate assessment or, as the case may be, an appropriate assessment under the birds or habitats directive, as required, carried out.  I also stress that the provisions of the Bill already provide that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht cannot make an order to de-designate an NHA, whether a raised bog or blanket bog site, without first having regard to any environmental assessment undertaken and observations or submissions received during public consultation.<\/p><p>As the Senator has said, amendment No. 12 is a consequential amendment arising from amendment No. 10.  I have tabled an amendment to the Bill which provides that the purposes of a review of the natural heritage area will also take into account the carbon sequestration of bog habitats and actions relevant to bog habitats contained in the national plan or plan for the island of Ireland for the time being concerning the reversal of pollinator decline.  I am conscious of the benefits of the restoration of peatlands, including the benefits for Ireland's commitments under international climate change targets and the fact that functioning peatlands capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation.  The all-Ireland pollinator strategy includes a strategy to address pollinator decline and protect pollination services on the island of Ireland.  As I have said, the plan was developed by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and is supported by a wide range of stakeholders, North and South.  The Government amendment addresses the concerns of Senators on this issue and, therefore, I will not be accepting the amendment.<\/p><p>The effect of amendment No. 13 would be to limit the provisions of the Bill to raised bog habitats only.  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, as initiated, has been amended in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and has been debated in committee.  It provides for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to conduct a review or reviews of blanket bog natural heritage areas, at his or her discretion, as well as to complete the 2014 review of raised bog habitats.  As I have previously emphasised, such a review of blanket bog natural heritage areas would not be carried out in a vacuum.  I went through this earlier in respect of amendment No. 9.  The same points apply in this regard and, therefore, I will not be accepting this amendment.<\/p><p>With regard to amendment No. 14, section 16(6) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 refers to \"special scientific interest \" in the process of proposing sites for designation as natural heritage areas under the Act.  Section 16(6) is also specifically referred to in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 with regard to the criteria to be taken into account in selecting the most suitable bog habitats to be designated as natural heritage areas.  To ensure that the selection process for the inclusion of sites in the reconfigured raised bog NHA network adopted a sustainable approach, the selection criteria, which include the primary environmental and technical factors essential for a raised bog existence now and into the future, also included economic and social criteria.  The environmental, technical, and socioeconomic criteria used for the raised bog natural heritage area review were given equal weighting and in all categories, the highest scores were given to the most favourable of sites, which were those with the best existing environmental standing and restoration potential and which would represent the most socially appropriate and economically advantageous investment.  At the same time, each site was examined by Department staff from a nature conservation and management perspective to ensure that the final outcomes of the selection process were practicable and achievable.  I envisage that the undertaking of a future review or reviews of the blanket bog NHAs would follow a similar sustainable approach, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  I therefore see no need to specifically refer to section 16(6) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 in the criteria to be taken into account when selecting the most suitable bog habitats to cease to be designated as NHAs, as referred to in the Bill.  As already provided for in the Bill, these criteria include environmental criteria, restoration potential, and national, regional, and local economic, social and cultural needs.  It is also proposed to include recreational and sporting needs, including greenways appropriate to bog habitats, in these criteria by way of amendment to the Bill.

While the Minister of State envisages a fuller process, envisaging is not the same as ensuring.  Given the debate we had on Committee Stage, it is curious that section 16(6), which has the benefit of listing specific concerns including \"scientific interest for one or more species, communities, habitats, landforms or geological or geomorphological features, or [...] diversity of natural attributes\", is not to be referenced.  It would have been very useful, and would have strengthened the case the Minister of State is making in respect of a future process, to clearly include those relatively important scientific factors in the environmental criteria.  Whether or not this amendment is successful, these factors should be reflected.  I am aware that should amendment No. 11 be successful, my amendments Nos. 13 and 14, which seek to improve the substance of section 4 of the Bill by the amendment of the proposed new section 18A(3) of the Act of 2000, will fall.  I cannot amend text that has not yet been inserted but, in light of this, I hope that those in the D&aacute;il will amend and insert changes to the Minister of State's amendment No. 11.  I hope they will take on board the concerns in respect of narrowing the focus to raised bogs only and will include a parity of consideration by ensuring that section 16(6) of the 2000 Act is fully reflected in the Bill.<\/p> <p>The wording of the Bill as discussed on Committee Stage referred to national, regional and local economic, social and cultural needs.  I did not object to that, although I objected to the overall section, but I think it captured quite a lot.  I do not know what is added by including \"recreational and sporting needs\".  If we have serious concerns in respect of the community, culture, the GAA, greenways, or access routes, the phrase \"national, regional and local economic, social and cultural needs\" is already wide enough to address such concerns.  I am therefore cautious and concerned about the explicit inclusion of recreational and sporting needs.  I do not see what additional benefit there is for the cases the Minister of State mentioned, such as walkways, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and access for heritage or environmental routes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They were already covered.  I am concerned that the words \"recreational and sporting needs\", especially as they are not defined in the Bill, could be taken as referring to golf courses, hotels, car parks or anything else because the meaning is wide open.  The Bill includes a definition of \"greenways\", but it does not include a definition of \"recreational and sporting needs (including greenways) appropriate to bog habitats\".  I have tabled amendments to seek to address that issue and hope the Minister of State will be able to provide some assurance for the public on it.  I have received many expressions of concern about what the words \"recreational and sporting needs\" mean.  I hope the Minister of State will also be able to accept my later amendments which seek to involve the Environmental Protection Agency or others in defining what is meant by \"recreational and sporting needs\".  It is wide open and the words could be taken to mean almost anything connected to tourism, a commercial or other use that has a recreational element.  <\/p><p>The core issue is what the Minister of State said about considering the impact on the environment, the level of degradation, etc.  If we were referring simply to considering those issues, that would be something.  This, however, involves a comparison.  The core problem I am seeking to address is that it is possible to make a comparison of the 36 natural heritage areas, to decide to dedesignate 20 of them and to only keep the best 16.  That would be instead of each bog being considered on its own merits.  I am worried that there will be a \"Weakest Link\" elimination process and that that is what is covered by the environmental criteria.  I refer to it as being a mechanism for comparison, not consideration.  It could allow a decision to be made to dedesignate 34 of the areas and keep only the best two.  The wording used is not substantial enough.  <\/p><p>I appreciate that after the Minister of State makes proposals for dedesignation, there will be public consultation and consideration of other factors.  However, I would much prefer if that consultation and consideration under the European habitats and bird directives happened before specific proposals were made.  I will, therefore, press amendment No. 10.  I hope we can work together to address, or ameliorate, some of the concerns I have expressed about the amendment, particularly changes to section 18A(3), in the context of later amendments in my name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#HH00200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 10 is covered by the proposed Government amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#JJ00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019101500002#JJ00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>We talk about carbon sequestration, the national plan and decline in pollinators.

The two amendments relate to the sequence in which the elements of a review and a post-review will be taken.  The Bill indicates that the Minister will carry out a review of three issues which the House has discussed at length.  I refer to section 4(4) which states:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister shall, in relation to the effects on the environment of the proposals arising from a review under subsection (1)&mdash;(a) carry out an assessment, including public consultation, under the European Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) Regulations 2004 (S.I.

I am concerned that there will be a ministerial review within very limited criteria in designating or dedesignating from which proposals will arise, following which there will be public consultation and so on.  Particularly when social and cultural needs will be among the factors to be considered when making proposals, it seems economic, social and cultural needs would be a natural fit.  I would, therefore, like public consultation and both social and environment impact assessments to be part of the development of proposals, rather than something that will happen after the fact.  <\/p><p>If amended, the section will read: &quot;The Minister shall, in relation to the effects on the environment of any proposals being considered during a review under subsection (1) ... carry out an assessment&quot; and so on.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State made it clear they are part of his intent.

It is a simple step but it would ensure the proposals that emerge from the review process under this legislation will be more robust and that it will not be the case that a Minister will conduct multiple reviews and then discover there are problems subsequently.  It would be better if the review itself were more comprehensive and included all these factors.  It would lead to better outcomes.

We will be having a review of our national peatlands strategy, of issues of just transition and of how we manage the future of Bord na M&oacute;na in terms of energy.  We will be considering all these issues at the Joint Committee on Climate Action over the next month but it is possible the legislation will already have passed.  The cart is being put before the horse.  Why are we passing legislation, setting out the processes and policies around the designation or de-designation of natural heritage areas, in advance of expert testimony being heard at the Joint Committee on Climate Action on issues that directly overlap with this?  For example, Bord na M&oacute;na will attend the committee, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will speak at the committee, we will hear from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and we will hear about peatland regeneration.  All these issues are pertinent to the substance of this Bill.  My concern is that we will effectively be in a situation whereby that testimony is too late to be taken on board in the drafting of this Bill.<\/p> <p>This amendment cannot fix that problem.  That is a matter of the Government's choice in scheduling and timing, but the amendment tries to somewhat ameliorate that issue.  I refer to section 4(4) which lists a number of issues that will be considered in regard to this matter.  Amendment No. 15 basically asks that, as well as carrying out that assessment, including the public consultation mentioned, and as well as carrying out other screening for assessment that might be required, including under the European Communities Act 1972, in the shaping of each individual consideration of proposals arising from a review, the Minister would have regard to recommendations that may emerge from a relevant Oireachtas committee on climate action.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am simply saying we have not incorporated those proposals into the shape of the Bill so perhaps we can at least give space to give the Minister the option of incorporating them into the designation or de-designation process.

The Senator has mentioned a number of initiatives, including the midlands fund that was announced in the budget, the re-wetting of bogs and the carbon fund, which is going towards the rehabilitation of bogs.  Some &euro;5 million will come from that and money will come from the environment fund to create a package of &euro;7 million for peatland rehabilitation.  I know one of the committees will be engaging with officials on that in the coming weeks.  There is a lot of positive action we can agree on and that is being backed up with funding as well.  The public consultation process provides an opportunity for any Oireachtas Member or committee to make observations or submissions, including on climate action.

Nonetheless, while those are positive initiatives arising from the original Joint Committee on Climate Action recommendations, my amendment is really on future recommendations that might arise from the Joint Committee on Climate Action subsequent to the hearings we are expecting in the next month.  I appreciate that any Member of the Oireachtas or any member of the public may participate in a public consultation, but allowing for public consultation is not the same as reflecting the considered proposals or recommendations that may emerge from the cross-party work of an Oireachtas committee that is directly tasked with the issue of climate action.
