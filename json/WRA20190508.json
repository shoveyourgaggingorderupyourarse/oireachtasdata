The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). <\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. <\/p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.<\/p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800051#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":104,"content":"<p>Question No. 45 answered with Question No. 27.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800051#WRC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[18883\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800051#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to provide psychological and counselling supports for children with mental health issues in schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service and it supports schools in a continuum of support process. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS sanctioned psychologist numbers have grown from a base of 173 whole-time equivalents (w.t.e.) in 2016 through the intervening Budget increases in 2017 and 2018 to 194 w.t.e. <\/p>  <p>  This Government remains firmly committed to the maintenance of a robust and effective educational psychological service. In this connection as part of Budget 2019 the provision of an additional 10 psychologist post to NEPS from next September was announced, bringing overall number to 204 w.t.e\u00a0to further strengthen the excellent service provided to our school community.<\/p>  <p>  A recruitment competition is currently in train by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to replenish NEPS regional recruitment panels to provide for both current vacancies and upcoming staffing increases for 2019\/20.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware my Department launched its Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2018-2023 in July 2018. This policy statement provides an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of well-being, which encompasses social and emotional learning across the curriculum.\u00a0 It builds on the good work already happening in schools to ensure that best practice in whole-school well-being promotion is embedded across the system. It outlines a multicomponent, whole school preventative approach to the promotion of well-being with interventions at both universal and targeted levels. The interconnectedness of attitudes towards self, and others, positive social behaviour, emotional recognition, stress management, empathy and decision-making\/problem-solving skills is recognised.\u00a0\u00a0 The power of empathy as a building block of tolerance and inclusion forms part of children and young people&rsquo;s social and emotional literacy.\u00a0 The Well-being Policy Statement and Frame work for Practice 2018-19 provides the overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work across the school curriculum.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  NEPS provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for individuals with clearly identified and serious difficulties.\u00a0 NEPS Guidelines for schools on Responding to Critical Incidents provide advice for schools in handling critical incidents and also advises about prevention and early intervention strategies for students at risk.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills does not make provision for therapeutic counselling in schools. When such counselling is considered to be required a referral is made to an outside agency.\u00a0 Schools are advised to have identified appropriate referral pathways in consultation with HSE and other mental health services in their local community.

This states that the central strategic objective of Civil Defence is to support the Principal Response Agencies of the Local Authorities, An Garda&iacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive in a variety of emergency and non-emergency situations. A large number of support roles for Civil Defence are listed under the Framework for Major Emergency Management. These include assisting in dealing with a wide range of emergencies at national and local level and include severe weather, flooding and searches for missing persons. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to supporting the Principal Response Agencies, Civil Defence has a long and proud tradition of assisting at community events. These events allow Civil Defence volunteers practice their skills while contributing to their community. <\/p>  <p>  In September 2018, I announced a review of the roles and functions of Civil Defence. The review will inform the commitment in the 2015 Government White Paper on Defence to update Civil Defence legislation. The outcome of the review will be a policy document titled \"Towards 2030\". The document will be an update on the existing \"Towards 2000\" document which dates from the mid 1990s. Given the passage of time and the changes within the organisation and society in general since the mid 1990s, it is an opportune and appropriate time for this review. <\/p>  <p>  The review process has involved a wide ranging consultation with all relevant stakeholders. This commenced with a workshop with Civil Defence Officers and Assistant Civil Defence Officers in September 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Following this, I announced a series of eight regional volunteer consultation meetings throughout the country in October and November. This was to allow Civil Defence volunteers have their say on the future of the organisation in which they so passionately serve and give freely of their time and expertise. My officials have also held meetings with the relevant subcommittee of the City and County Managers Association, the Health Service Executive, An Garda&iacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Fire Directorate of the Department of the Housing, Planning and Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  A draft discussion document on Towards 2030 was circulated to all Civil Defence Officers, Assistant Civil Defence Officers and their line managers within Local Authorities in early April 2019 in advance of a series of regional meetings in April 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Observations and comments from these regional meetings will feed into an updated draft of Towards 2030 that will be re-circulated to Civil Defence Officers, Assistant Civil Defence Officers and their line managers members this month. That draft will also be circulated to members of the Civil Defence Inter Agency Guidance Team in advance of the forthcoming meeting of this group. The Guidance Team was established on foot of the 2015 Government White Paper on Defence. <\/p>  <p>  As the development of Towards 2030 progresses, my officials and I will continue to engage with Stakeholders.  I have asked my officials to submit a final draft of Towards 2030 by Autumn 2019 for my consideration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800052#WRD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800052#WRD05300"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[19500\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800052#WRD05400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if consideration is being given to raising the age limits for eligibility to join the Defence Forces (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>The nature of military service requires that the age and health profile of personnel in the Defence Forces must be appropriately managed to ensure that capability requirements are met.

Citizens in Bahrain are living in an increasingly restrictive society and there has been further erosion of fundamental freedoms in recent years, including freedom of opinion and expression. I remain concerned about the detention of a number of people in Bahrain, both in respect of the grounds for detention, and their treatment by the Bahraini authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns arise in respect of the fairness of court proceedings and the decisions in a number of cases to revoke citizenship of individuals.  The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed alarm at a court decision of 16 April 2019 that revoked the citizenship of 138 people, and has urged Bahrain to bring its broad counter-terrorism and counter-extremism legislation in line with its international human rights obligations. A separate decision to reinstate the citizenship of 551 people on 21 April was a welcome development, though there is still a significant number of former Bahraini citizens who may be effectively stateless.<\/p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees and is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. These principles feed into our bilateral dialogue; for example, officials from my Department met with officials from the Bahraini Embassy in March 2019 and raised our human rights concerns directly with them. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, as a small country, amplifies its voice on human rights issues through multilateral engagement and through measured recommendations offered as part of constructive dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  Through our interventions at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) Ireland has sought to ensure that the human rights situation in Bahrain and in other locations where we have concerns, remains in focus. Ireland has repeatedly raised human rights concerns in Bahrain at the HRC in recent Item 4 Statements (\"human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention\"). For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. <\/p>  <p>  At the most recent HRC Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain's human rights record in 2017, Ireland urged Bahrain to accept an open offer by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Bahrain.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the rights of prisoners and detainees in general, Ireland co-sponsored HRC Resolution 36\/16, which calls upon States to &lsquo;investigate promptly, effectively and impartially all alleged human rights violations and abuses suffered by persons deprived of their liberty, in particular cases involving death, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to provide effective remedies to the victims, and to ensure that detention administrations cooperate fully with the investigating authority and preserve all evidence&rsquo;. Ireland has also co-sponsored; Resolution 30\/7, concerning human rights in the administration of justice; Resolution 31\/31, concerning torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and UN General Assembly Resolution 71\/188, also concerning human rights in the administration of justice. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights.  We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, whenever opportunities arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Data","counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[18491\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of passports issued to persons over 65 years of age in each of the years 2012 to 2018; and the estimated cost per year if free passports were reintroduced for persons over 65 years of age.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>The cost of the standard ten year adult Irish passport compares favourably with many other jurisdictions.

Promises made during the recent elections in Israel, including some reportedly threatening to annex lands in the West Bank, are unhelpful and have a damaging impact on the prospects for a positive outcome.  <\/p>  <p>  Unhelpful election rhetoric is not unique to Israel, and Ireland and the EU will judge the new Government, which is still to be formed, on what it actually does, rather than on what may have been said in the heat of the campaign. But that does not mean such words are of no consequence, since they send dangerous messages to militant settlers, and contribute to a climate of fear and insecurity among Palestinians.<\/p>  <p>  Annexation of territory by force is illegal under international law, including the UN Charter, and the position of Ireland and the EU is clear on this. <\/p>  <p>  In a statement on 8 April I condemned the reported decisions by the Israeli authorities to advance plans for further settlement construction and related activities in the West Bank. On 11 April, there was a clear and principled EU statement, also referring to these decisions on construction in settlements and on the legal status of settlement outposts.  The statement reiterated that \"The European Union's position on Israeli settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian territory is clear and remains unchanged: all settlement activity is illegal under international law. It erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace...\"<\/p>  <p>  The relentless process of settlement expansion and related activities in the West Bank, including forced removal of Palestinians from their homes, is critically damaging the viability of a future Palestinian State, and thus the prospects for a peace agreement and an end to the conflict. I have consistently made this view very clear - in the Oireachtas, at EU and international level, and directly to the Israeli authorities during my visits to the region. <\/p>  <p>  Settlements are illegal under international law, undermine the very basis of the two state solution, and erode the credibility of Israel&rsquo;s commitment to a peaceful solution to the conflict. The pursuit of the settlement project also inevitably involves a range of injustices to Palestinians, such as evictions, demolition of homes, and seizure of land, and a wide range of security and other measures discriminating against Palestinians in their daily lives for the benefit of settlers. For all these reasons Ireland has focussed on settlements as a major driver of the continuing conflict.<\/p>  <p>  Continued expansion of settlements in these areas is not compatible with a good faith effort to reach a peace agreement, and this is undermining the faith of many Palestinians in a political path. <\/p>  <p>  It has long been proposed that a future peace agreement may involve some agreed mutual border adjustments, if the parties so wish it. But such changes can only be by mutual agreement. Any unilateral statement of annexation by Israel of occupied territory would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland or the international community more generally.<\/p>  <p>  With the prospects for peace continuing to deteriorate on the ground, EU Foreign Ministers have discussed the peace process on numerous occasions over the last year. <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, I convened a meeting in February on the present state of the Middle East Peace Process with a small group of EU and Arab Foreign Ministers, and the Secretary General of the Arab League. At this meeting we considered how the EU, together with the international community, can productively engage and better use all the levers at our disposal to influence the parties to the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU stand by the internationally agreed parameters for a negotiated peace agreement and continue to urge the Israeli Government to uphold its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Cases","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[18753\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); if he has raised the issue with his Emirati counterpart; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case raised by the Deputy, and I am increasingly worried about reports of the deteriorating health of the individual in question.

The Working Group was established on foot of a resolution to the Human Rights Council in 2014 led by a number of developing countries, including Ecuador and South Africa. <\/p>  <p>  Four sessions of the Working Group have taken place to date.  In advance of the fourth and most recent session in October 2018, Ecuador circulated the \"zero draft\" of a legally binding instrument.   The next session of the Group will take place in October 2019.  Notwithstanding our serious concerns about the way in which the work of the Group has been conducted to date, Ireland will work with EU partners to engage actively and constructively in the negotiation process.  <\/p>  <p>  While we are open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty, we believe that all economic operators should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner.  The \"zero draft\" treaty that has been circulated focuses on transnational corporations and it is Ireland's view that any new treaty should cover both companies engaged in purely domestic operations as well as transnational corporations.  <\/p>  <p>  Such a treaty should also reflect essential human rights principles, reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights.  On this point,  I would note that of the 21 countries which to date have adopted National Plans on Business and Human Rights, 16, including Ireland, are EU Member States.   <\/p>  <p>  We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, we are of the view that the UN Working Party on Business and Human Rights and the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights provide appropriate fora for consideration of any new initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":231,"content":"<p>Question No. 87 answered with Question No. 76.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[19036\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he is taking to pursue the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, in particular the need for the Assembly and power sharing Executive to reconvene and take up their devolved powers on behalf of the population of Northern Ireland in view of the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the threat of paramilitary violence; the additional resources being provided for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>The continuing absence of vital institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is a source of deep concern for the Government, as it is for the British Government.<\/p><p>Yesterday, 7 May, I and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland convened the inclusive multi-party talks in Belfast, which the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach announced on 26 April, involving all five main parties and the two Governments.<\/p><p>The objective is to seek to quickly re-establish to full operation the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement - the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council.<\/p><p>A meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference is taking place in London today, 8 May.

In addition, my Department coordinates the Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Rights, which is chaired by my colleague Minister Ciaran Cannon and which comprises officials from relevant Government Departments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Cases","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[19483\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800053#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps taken to secure the release of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>The Government is aware of and very concerned about the case of Human Rights Activist, Mr. Azimjan Askarov and has communicated these concerns to the Government of Kyrgyzstan.

We expect that Kyrgyzstan will be reviewed again in January 2020 and this will be another opportunity for us to reiterate our Human Rights concerns.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is very supportive of the EU's structured, regular human rights dialogue with Kyrgyzstan which is held on an annual basis, most recently in June 2018 where the EU highlighted the positive role of Human Rights Defenders and civil society for creating civic spaces both in the EU and Kyrgyzstan. The next Human Rights Dialogue is expected to take place next month.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland attaches considerable importance to the vital work of human rights defenders and condemns all acts or threats of violence against organisations and individuals working to protect human rights.

The Council of Europe&rsquo;s work with young people is aimed to empower them to engage in the development of democratic, inclusive and peaceful societies across our continent. <\/p>  <p>  In 2019 Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to the Council of Europe, calculated on the basis of our GDP and population, was &euro;3,908,197.41 .

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him or her. In order to meet this requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  Entitlement to Irish citizenship is determined by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, under which Irish citizenship may be obtained by birth, by descent, or by naturalisation.<\/p>  <p>  An individual born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is automatically an Irish citizen. For individuals born outside of Ireland, they may claim citizenship if they had at least one parent who was born in the island of Ireland before 2005. <\/p>  <p>  Individuals born outside of Ireland can also claim citizenship through a parent who was not born in Ireland but was an Irish citizen at the time of the individual's birth, or through a grandparent born in Ireland. Individuals who wish to claim citizenship through these means must have his\/her birth entered on the Foreign Births Register (FBR). Citizenship commences after inclusion on the FBR. Further details regarding the process can be consulted at the Passport Service's website. <\/p>  <p>  An individual may also apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation. Minimum residency terms must be satisfied before an individual is eligible for citizenship through naturalisation. The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for citizenship matters, including applications for naturalisation.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service would be happy to provide further information and guidance to the person in question.

Since the UK referendum, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit with dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. <\/p>  <p>  My focus, as Minister for Finance, is to protect our economic and financial interests, and to minimise the disruption to the Irish economy to the greatest extent possible. We have worked hard to rebalance our economy from where it was twelve years ago, before the global financial crisis. Growth and resilience in our economy today is evenly spread across a range of sectors, equipping us to better withstand a sudden external shock. <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, we have prioritised building up the resilience of the economy and the public finances, so that we have the capacity to deal with an adverse economic shock. We have set aside &euro;1.5 billion in a Rainy Day Fund. We are supporting our companies to prepare for Brexit, to diversify their markets and supply chains, to develop new skills and to explore new opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy, the 10-year National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Government welcomed the decision of the recent European Council to extend the Article 50 process until 31 October 2019. The extension includes giving the UK flexibility to leave before that date should the Withdrawal Agreement be ratified.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains focused on the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement as the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to fully protect the Good Friday Agreement. The decision of the European Council provides the UK with more time to ensure an orderly withdrawal. However, while it means that the immediate risk of a no deal Brexit has receded, it has not been fully averted. The preparations that have been taking place since before the Brexit referendum are therefore continuing and my Department continues to work within the whole-of-Government approach and to coordinate closely with its agencies in developing and implementing plans and measures to protect our economy. <\/p>  <p>  In particular, my Department is working closely with the Central Bank of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for financial stability and has been focused on Brexit since before the UK referendum. It is working closely with financial services firms to ensure appropriate contingency planning arrangements, and that they are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers as possible. In relation to the funding of the State, the NTMA&rsquo;s strategy continues to take account of the market dislocation risks posed by Brexit and the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding position is strong. Within the Revenue Commissioners, there is a very significant programme of work that has been ongoing in terms of ICT, staffing and engagement across the country with the business community with the objective of minimising disruption to trade and supporting business to be as prepared as possible. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Department and its relevant agencies are continuing to work to ensure that they are as prepared as possible to limit the inevitable disruption to the economy and to citizens post Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Levy","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[18916\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider increasing the rate at which pension recipients must pay tax on a pension; and his views on the fact that this rate has not been increased in line with inflation.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>Following clarification received from the Deputy&rsquo;s office, I understand that the question relates to the issue of increasing the age exemption limits.<\/p>  <p>  A person aged 65 and over is fully exempt from income tax where his or her total income from all sources is less than the relevant exemption limit. For 2019, the exemption limits are &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners and &euro;18,000 for a single individual.

Under the Scheme, Charities are entitled to claim a refund of a proportion of their VAT costs based on their level of non-public funding. The Scheme applies to VAT incurred on or after 1 January 2018 and will be paid one year in arrears. For example, in 2019, Charities can reclaim some element of the VAT paid in 2018, but VAT paid in prior years cannot be claimed.<\/p>  <p>  A total annual capped fund of &euro;5m is available for payment under the Scheme, which will be subject to review after three years. Where the total amount of eligible claims from all Charities in a year exceeds the capped amount, claims will be paid on a pro-rata basis. Detailed information regarding the VAT Compensation Scheme for Charities is available on the Revenue Commissioners website at the following link:<\/p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/value-added-tax\/part12-refunds-and-repayments-of-tax\/vat-compensation-scheme\/vat-compensation-scheme-guidelines.pdf<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2019, 101 claims have been received by Revenue from Charities amounting to &euro;1.5m. The closing date for submissions in respect of 2018 is 30 June 2019. Once the closing date has passed, Revenue will review the claims received and issue refunds later in the year in accordance with the rules of the Scheme. Charities wishing to submit a claim in respect of 2018 can do so through the Revenue Online Service (ROS) at any stage between 1 January 2019 and 30 June 2019. The minimum claim amount that can be submitted is &euro;500. A &lsquo;linked&rsquo; agent may also make the claim on ROS on behalf of the Charity.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the overall communications strategy for the Scheme, I am aware that Revenue has, in addition to publishing the detailed information on its website, engaged directly with Charities to explain the operational administration and issued reminder notifications in January 2019 advising of its commencement. Revenue also issued an e-Brief to tax practitioners in December 2018 setting out the details of the Scheme and how it will operate and has worked with the Charities representative bodies to prepare a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). Furthermore, Revenue plans to publish a further notification in early May reminding Charities of the 30 June 2019 closing date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF06300"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[18685\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF06400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the Revenue Commissioners will amend and deliver the payslip of a person (details supplied); if his attention has been drawn to delays in the processing of payslips for substitute teachers; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it has no role to play in providing or amending payslips and that responsibility in this regard rests with employers.<\/p><p>Revenue has also confirmed that it has already been in direct contact with the person in question and provided them with the information that they require. <\/p><p>While there were some delays in processing substitute teachers' pay earlier this year, I am not aware of any current difficulties and it is my understanding that payslips are being provided on a timely basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Debt Restructuring","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF06600"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[18827\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800054#WRF06700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 109 of 2 April 2019, the number of persons a bank (details supplied) has petitioned personal bankruptcy proceedings in the High Court since 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my department does not hold the information that is being sought.

This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance. The Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, detailed in an action plan with agreed timelines for implementation.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent progress update was published at the beginning of March and shows that 24 out of the total of 26 action points which were due for completion during 2018 overall have been accomplished. I am confident that the two outstanding actions will be completed in the coming months, along with the three remaining action points with deadlines set for various quarters throughout 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The actions implemented to date cut across a number of different areas and include:<\/p>  <p>  - The publication of by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<\/p>  <p>  - Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 have been amended to ensure defendants are appropriately notified of a claim having been submitted against their policy and to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, respectively;<\/p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commencing the collection of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system; and,<\/p>  <p>  - The Courts Service confirming that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy believes that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and he and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, are working closely together to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0Alongside this,\u00a0the Law Reform Commission (LRC) is\u00a0 undertaking a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries as\u00a0part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.\u00a0 I understand that an LRC Issues Paper on the matter is anticipated later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance. I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[18920\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the way in which the cost of tax expenditures in revenue forgone are calculated; if he is satisfied that the current calculating methodology is adequate; the amount of revenue foregone in each of the years 2011 to 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the available information in respect of the\u00a0cost of tax expenditures (credits, allowances and reliefs) is published on Revenue&rsquo;s statistics web page at<\/p><p><i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/documents\/statistics\/tax-expenditures\/costs-tax-expenditures.pdf. <\/i><\/p><p>My Department also publishes its own Report on Tax Expenditures each year, and I expect that it will be\u00a0 published with the Budget 2020 documents\u00a0later this year, as they have been each year since 2015.\u00a0<\/p><p>Both Revenue and my Department\u00a0acknowledge that estimates of revenue foregone can be different due to different definitions of what is included in a list of\u00a0tax expenditures.

The completion of this work remains very important in order to fully achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market.\u00a0 In this regard, I believe that significant progress has been made on the motor side which is reflected in the fact that the most recent Central Statistics Office data indicates that the cost of motor insurance has fallen by 23.8% since July 2016.\u00a0 Consequently the average consumer should be seeing reductions when renewing their motor insurance.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to draw attention to some significant legislative developments. \u00a0Most recently, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 (No. 3 of 2019) has been enacted and has been commenced. The Act will strengthen the functioning of the Board in a number of ways, including dealing with issues of non-attendance at medicals and failure to provide details of special damages or loss of earnings. \u00a0In addition, the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act was commenced on 28 January. \u00a0As well as of course leading to the full functioning of the database itself, it has also facilitated amendments to sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which many stakeholders sought in order to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.\u00a0 The PIC recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While the Working Group will continue to focus on implementing all of its recommendations and\u00a0will continue to report on its advancements, in the Progress Updates, which hereafter will be produced on a biannual basis, I consider that bringing the levels of damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions is undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs.\u00a0 The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he hopes that the Bill will be enacted as soon as possible.\u00a0 In this regard, it recently completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.\u00a0 Alongside this,\u00a0the Law Reform Commission (LRC) is\u00a0undertaking a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries as part\u00a0of its\u00a0Fifth Programme of Law Reform.\u00a0\u00a0 I understand that an LRC Issues Paper on the matter is anticipated later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.\u00a0 I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for consumers and businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Data","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG03600"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[19170\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons here that have been fined for not having VRT in each of the past five years.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the number of persons fined by the courts for VRT offences in each of the past five years is provided in the table below.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of persons fined<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The total number of VRT Seizures and Compromise Penalties paid (dealt with administratively) in each of the past five years is provided in the table below.<table><tr><th>2014<\/th><th>1,054<\/th><th>&euro;716,765<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>1,133<\/td><td>&euro;698,570<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>1,357<\/td><td>&euro;1,006,487<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>1,304<\/td><td>&euro;825,130<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>1,223<\/td><td>&euro;818,915<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears Breaches","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG03900"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[19173\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that certain lenders are not complying with section 45(a) of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 and the mortgage arrears resolution process due to the fact that they are only offering borrowers the option of voluntary surrender in a scenario in which the mortgage has been deemed to be unsustainable;

If the borrower pays the arrears in a later year, then the appropriate mortgage interest relief will be paid in the year in which the payment is made, subject to the ceiling applicable for that year. <\/p>  <p>  Mortgage interest relief is administered through the Tax Relief at Source (TRS) system.\u00a0 Revenue issues detailed instructions to each lending institution setting out the criteria to be used in calculating the correct amount of mortgage interest relief applicable to the various qualifying loans. The lending institutions then apply the criteria to interest payments received from borrowers to calculate the correct amount of relief. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue does not have any authority to instruct mortgage providers on how payments received from borrowers should be allocated to the borrower&rsquo;s account, and any disputes in this regard are a matter for both parties to resolve. Revenue&rsquo;s only role is to ensure the TRS system is properly administered, based on the information provided, and that payments claimed through the system are made on a timely basis.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue carries out compliance checks on the various mortgage providers to ensure the correct operation of the mortgage interest relief scheme. As part of the compliance process, each main lender is required to submit a monthly electronic file to Revenue setting out the amount of qualifying interest paid by each borrower and the amount of mortgage interest relief allowed in respect of each qualifying loan in the previous month.\u00a0 Smaller lenders and local authorities are required to submit annual files setting out similar information.\u00a0 Each month, Revenue cross-checks the information provided by the lenders against its own database and any discrepancies are immediately followed up with the lender.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The most recent compliance checks to be completed related to March 2019, during which 261,299 TRS accounts were reviewed. Following the review 2,460 queries were raised with the various lenders, of which only 14 remain to be resolved. <\/p>  <p>  Under Section 244A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, Revenue can request a lender to provide information in relation to any qualifying mortgage loan to verify that the correct relief was applied, and the lender must comply with the request within 30 days. On the rare occasion where a shortfall is identified, Revenue will pay the amount due directly to the borrower. <\/p>  <p>  On receipt of any complaints or queries from mortgage holders or their representatives, Revenue will always follow up with the lending institution to ensure issues are investigated and resolved without delay. <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that if a regulated entity has applied charges or reliefs to consumers in arrears (whether that be through a misapplication of tax relief or any other relevant charge) in a way that results in arrears figures being incorrect or overstated, the Central Bank of Ireland expects that, as an error, it is rectified speedily and accurately and in line with the provisions of the Consumer Protection Code, 2012 (the Code). In particular, section 10 of the Code makes specific provision for resolving consumer complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG04900"},{"type":"question","counter":388,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[19228\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to and his views on whether it is appropriate that a bank (details supplied) as a majority State owned institution, has contracted services from a company that is one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":389,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, AIB is an independent company with listings on the Irish\u00a0and London Stock Exchanges.

<\/p>  <p>  - The recommendation that the Law Reform Commission (LRC) undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth<\/p>  <p>  Programme of Law Reform has commenced;<\/p>  <p>  -Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 have been amended to ensure defendants are appropriately notified of a claim having been submitted against their policy and to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, respectively;<\/p>  <p>  -An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has commenced the collection of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system; and<\/p>  <p>  -The Courts Service has confirmed that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.\u00a0 In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.\u00a0 Both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality Mr Charlie Flanagan TD to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I think it is worth noting that Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has met with a number of relevant businesses impacted, including those from the leisure and tourism sectors and their relevant representative bodies, to understand the issues they have experienced in their particular sectors.\u00a0 In addition, the Minister of State has held meetings with Insurance Ireland, and some relevant insurers, on these issues.\u00a0 I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.\u00a0 I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG05800"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[19287\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG05900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 64 of 18 April 2019, the status of the outcome of the meeting between the Revenue Commissioners and an organisation (details supplied);

Under the regime, a fund is classified as an IREF if it derives 25% or more of its value from Irish land and buildings. The section was introduced to address the use of certain fund vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors, thereby avoiding a charge to tax on profits arising from Irish real estate.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that information in relation to the value of property held by IREFs for the years 2016 to 2018 is currently incomplete. Partial information is available in relation to IREFs from the tax returns they have made to Revenue for the years 2017 and 2018. This is due to the fact that only IREFs that have a taxable event in a year are required to make a tax return to Revenue and not all IREFs have made returns for the requested years. Revenue are currently working on the tax returns that have been made to them for the years 2017 and 2018. Financial statements were filed on 30 January 2019 with Revenue for all IREF&rsquo;s for all accounting periods which ended during 2017 and accounting periods which ended or on or before 30 June 2018. This accounting data is being analysed by Revenue at present. When this work is complete Revenue will be in a position to provide the information that the Deputy has requested.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of effective rates, as IREFs are fund vehicles which are taxed under the gross roll-up exit tax regime they are not subject to corporation tax or capital gains tax. Accordingly, there are no effective corporation tax rates or capital gains tax (CGT) rates for IREFs for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the exemption from IREF withholding tax on the distribution of capital gains on assets which had been held for more than 5 years, this exclusion was removed as part of Finance Act 2017.\u00a0 The removal applies to any assets disposed of on or after 1 January 2019, regardless of the date on which the asset was acquired.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the taxation of institutional investors, IREF withholding tax at 20% applies to profits paid out of an IREF, this withholding tax does not apply to certain categories of investor. Irish pension funds, for example, are exempt from Irish tax with tax being levied when the pensioner draws down the pension.\u00a0 As such, Irish pension funds are also exempt from IREF withholding tax. European pension funds which are equivalent to Irish pension funds are likewise exempt from the IREF withholding tax.\u00a0 There are however anti-avoidance rules, known as the Personal Portfolio IREF rules, which prevent closely held exempt vehicles being used to avoid a charge to IREF withholding tax.<\/p>  <p>  Where an investor holds less than 10% of the units in an IREF, they may be able to claim a refund of any IREF withholding tax suffered under the dividend article of a double tax agreement.\u00a0 Investors who hold more than 10% of the units cannot avail of a refund under a double tax agreement.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the applicability of CGT on the disposal of shares, an amendment was made in Finance Act 2017 to clarify the tax position in respect of an indirect disposal of IREF units &ndash; e.g. a disposal of a share that derives its value from IREF units. The amendment clarified that an indirect disposal of the units would not trigger CGT, as the profits to which the IREF charge applies remain within the IREF and within the scope of IREF withholding tax. This change was made to ensure consistency in the application of the IREF legislation. By contrast, a direct disposal of an IREF unit (e.g. the sale of a unit) is not subject to CGT as any gains within the IREF, which are reflected in the value of the unit, are subject to tax under the IREF tax regime.\u00a0 It was considered inconsistent to have a situation whereby the direct disposal of a unit was not subject to CGT due to being already subject to an exit tax, whereas the indirect disposal of a unit was subject both to CGT and the IREF withholding tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Real Estate Investment Trusts","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG06800"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[19316\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG06900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the value of property held by REITs in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[19322\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG07000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the effective corporate tax and capital gains tax rates for REITs in each of the years 2016 to 2018.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":408,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[19323\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800055#WRG07100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the definition of completed REITs which are subject to capital gains tax on developed assets sold within three years of completing development;  if it refers to building structures such as roof in place; and if not, if it refers to completed when furnished.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":409,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146, 149 and 150 together.<\/p>  <p>Finance Act 2013 introduced the regime for the operation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Ireland.\u00a0The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption, but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply to property investment via a corporate vehicle. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A company electing to be a REIT must meet specific conditions in accordance with Part 25A of the TCA.

These results, along with other economic indicators (including the modified current account, labour market developments and credit developments) are considered by the Department when assessing the cyclical position of the economy. The development of the Department of Finance&rsquo;s own approach is seen as providing more intuitive estimates of the cyclical position than the Commission&rsquo;s harmonised methodology, thereby helping to better inform fiscal policy-making.<\/p>  <p>  This work was undertaken as a response to the under performance of the Commission&rsquo;s harmonised methodology in estimating Ireland&rsquo;s output gap. The harmonised methodology has often produced counter-intuitive results for Ireland&rsquo;s cyclical position. This is largely due to the &ldquo;one-size fits all&rdquo; nature of the approach which fails to accurately account for the specific characteristics of the Irish economy. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) has welcomed the use of the Department&rsquo;s alternative approach.<\/p>  <p>  Assessment of the Medium Term Objective (MTO), the cornerstone of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), requires an estimate of the structural budget balance. This is the cyclically adjusted general government balance less one-offs or temporary measures. An estimate of Ireland&rsquo;s output gap is necessary to calculate the cyclical component of the budgetary balance. This is used in turn to derive the structural balance. As a result, using estimates of the output gap based on the Commission&rsquo;s methodology can lead to counter-intuitive estimates for the structural balance.<\/p>  <p>  Considering this, an alternative Department of Finance structural balance was included in Table 1 of the Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2019, alongside an estimate of the structural balance based on the Commission&rsquo;s approach (referred to respectively in Table 1 as the 'DOF' and &lsquo;SGP&rsquo; approaches ). This methodology makes use of the Department&rsquo;s alternative assessment of the cyclical position of the economy and therefore produces estimates for the structural balance that are more representative of the underlying performance of the economy. <\/p>  <p>  The Department will continue to use the harmonised approach to estimate the level of potential output as it is the legally binding reference method used by the Commission for assessment of Member States&rsquo; compliance with the SGP. Moreover, when issues with the methodology manifest themselves the Department will continue to engage with the Commission bilaterally and through the Output Gap Working Group to devise solutions that help to improve the plausibility of potential output estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800056#WRH04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme Data","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800056#WRH04300"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[19518\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800056#WRH04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number and amount of payments made in each year under the home renovation scheme since it was introduced; the amounts paid out under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that monthly statistics on the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) are published at <i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/information-about-revenue\/statistics\/tax-expenditures\/hri\/hri-quarterly.aspx.<\/i><\/p><p>The number of HRI works, by year commenced, and the value of associated tax credits available under the Incentive is provided below.

system alongside a &lsquo;security feature&rsquo; system for tobacco products supplied on EU markets.\u00a0 The traceability and security features (TSF) systems required by the Directive are to be in place by 20 May 2019 in respect of cigarettes and Roll-Your-Own tobacco, and by 20 May 2024 in respect of all other tobacco products. <\/p>  <p>  The &lsquo;traceability&rsquo; system requires that all tobacco products manufactured in, or imported into, the EU must be marked with what is referred to as a &lsquo;unique identifier&rsquo;.\u00a0 The unique identifier will be scanned at each stage in the legitimate tobacco supply chain by the importer, wholesaler or distributor concerned using specialised equipment.\u00a0 The EU Commission has noted that the data collated from this process will give an EU-wide picture of the quantity of tobacco products supplied to each member state market, up to the last point before retail sale.\u00a0 All tobacco products will also, under the Directive, be required to carry a security feature which will verify the authenticity of the product concerned.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The key developments to date in the implementation of TSF systems for tobacco products in Ireland are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - EU legislation in form of delegated and implementing acts specifying the measures to be implemented by Member States were adopted in May 2018.\u00a0 The Department of Health and Revenue represented Ireland during the detailed technical work of finalising this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  -\u00a0In July 2018, the Government approved the appointment of Revenue as the competent authority for the implementation of TSF systems in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  -\u00a0In September 2018, Revenue notified tobacco manufacturers and importers that the Irish tax stamp, used for the collection of tobacco excise on cigarettes and roll your own tobacco products, may be used as the &lsquo;security feature&rsquo; for tobacco products under the TSF regime.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  -\u00a0In March 2019, Revenue appointed Allexis s.r.o. as the &lsquo;ID issuer&rsquo; for tobacco products in Ireland following an open procurement process.\u00a0\u00a0 The main functions of the ID issuer are to assign specific identifier codes to each economic operator involved in the tobacco supply chain and to generate unique identifiers for each individual tobacco product placed on the market.\u00a0 The costs are borne by tobacco manufacturers and importers. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  -\u00a0Revenue continues to work closely with the Department of Health, the EU Commission and other EU Member States on the introduction of TSF systems.\u00a0 In addition, Revenue has consulted with manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retail bodies on the introduction of the TSF systems.\u00a0 These consultations are necessary to ensure the smooth implementation of the TSF systems and to ensure continued efficient collection of tobacco excise receipts.\u00a0 Revenue also maintains a contact and updates web page on its activities in this area on www.revenue.ie.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following the adoption of the relevant Directive in 2013, there was a delay of approximately three years before a satisfactory model for the TSF systems was agreed at EU level.\u00a0 This has created challenges in meeting the start date of 20 May 2019 for the TSF systems across the EU.\u00a0 Revenue has advised that notwithstanding this delay preparations are proceeding satisfactorily and that it will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that the TSF systems are introduced on schedule.\u00a0 It will take up to two months after 20 May 2019 before tobacco products which comply with the TSF regime enter Irish supply chains.

Primary legislation was necessary in order to bring that change into effect.  It was made clear at the time that until such legislation was enacted, the compulsory retirement age of 65, which applied to the vast majority of this cohort, remained in effect and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age would be required to retire.<\/p>  <p>  Interim arrangements were provided for the cohort of public servants who reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 after the Government Decision because, while they would be aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision, they would be unable to avail of it.  Those arrangements permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).  Without that specific arrangement, they would have been required to cease working on reaching the age of 65.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 was enacted on 26 December 2018. Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.  The terms of their contracts continue to apply and they will cease working when they reach the age of 66.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the gov.ie website. <\/p>  <p>  Having considered all of the issues outlined in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the report, I do not propose to make any changes to those terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800058#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800058#WRK00700"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[19416\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800058#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 143 of 26 February 2019, the position regarding the matter; the progress made since the reply issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my responses to his previous questions on 3<sup>rd<\/sup>July 2018, 9<sup>th<\/sup>October 2018 and 26<sup>th<\/sup>February 2019 in relation to this matter.

Consequently, the estimated costs are to be reassessed during 2019 as the measures are implemented. As outlined in Expenditure Report 2019, in the absence of any re-prioritisation of expenditure identified during the Estimates process, these costs will need to be met from the remaining unallocated resources.

However it remains the position that the community sector personnel concerned are not public servants and their terms and conditions of employment including the payment of pensions do not fall within public service provision. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore there has been extensive discussion of this issue at the Community Sector High Level Forum which was reconvened to examine certain matters pertaining to the Community Employment sector and in particular to ensure that the issues in question were fully examined having regard to both costs and precedent.  The implications arising from this claim extend beyond the CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors cadre and impact across the entire Community and Voluntary sector. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out by my Department in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The scoping exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost exposure for the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the size of the sector which is difficult to ascertain, were consequential demands to be made to fund employer pension contributions for all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations.

If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff. <\/p>  <p>  Not all pension recipients will be due these increases. This is partly due to protections in place (known as &lsquo;grace periods&rsquo;) for public servants retiring after the application of pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation, whereby the pensions of those public servants were calculated using the higher pay rates that were in effect prior to the application of the pay cuts. Similarly, the pensions of many of those who retired before the imposition of pay cuts are still based on higher salary rates than the salaries of serving public servants, and so those pensions don&rsquo;t qualify for pension increases.<\/p>  <p>  The administrative procedures for applying the pension increase policy are not straightforward.

The pension recipient in this case was protected from the effect of the 2013 pay cut by the operation of what is known as the &lsquo;grace period&rsquo;, whereby his pension benefits were calculated based on the pay rates that applied prior to the 2013 cut (i.e. based on the rates of pay in place after the 2010 cut had been applied).<\/p>  <p>  To answer the question fully, reference must first be had to what is happening in relation to the pay of serving public servants.

The FEMPI 2015 Act and the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 Act substantially lessened both the impact of PSPR and the numbers of pension recipients affected by it in 2018 and 2019, and the effects will extend even further in 2020. Since 1 January 2018, the majority of public service pensions have not been subject to PSPR. <\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, the majority of the salaries of serving staff have not yet been restored to the levels in payment prior to the first round of FEMPI cuts in January 2010.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the pension increase policy for pre-existing pension schemes agreed as part of the PSSA, I would note that this policy is essentially a time-limited (expires end-2020) resumption of the non-statutory pension increase arrangements, sometimes known as pay parity, which formerly prevailed, but which lapsed in 2010. Under that policy, pay increases applied to serving staff over the course of the PSSA are passed on to those pensions where the salary on which the pension is based, in any case, does not exceed the salary of a serving staff member with the same grade and scale point, after the pay increase has been applied. If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.<\/p>  <p>  For former public servants who retired before March 2012, their pension was calculated on the higher salary rates that were in payment prior to imposition of the FEMPI cuts. As the salary rates of the majority of serving public servants have not yet been restored to those levels, in the main, this cohort of pension recipients have not yet qualified for increases. By contrast, former public servants who retired from March 2012 onwards had the 2010 FEMPI cut reflected in the salary used to calculate their pension. Accordingly, as PSSA pay increases are granted to serving staff, bringing their pay rates closer to pre-FEMPI levels, this cohort of pension recipients will benefit, over the course of the PSSA, from consequential increases to their pensions with the same effective date as the pay increases applied to their colleagues still in service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800059#WRL06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800059#WRL06400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":655,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800059#WRL06300"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[18561\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800059#WRL06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to support the development of a national hairdressing apprenticeship by an organisation (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p>The development of a new national apprenticeship in hairdressing is almost complete.

NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for individuals with clearly identified and serious difficulties.  Consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions delivered in the school setting is also available.  When counselling is considered to be required a referral is made to an outside agency.  Schools are advised to have identified appropriate referral pathways in consultation with HSE and other mental health services in their local community. NEPS helps schools in the process of making referrals to external agencies as appropriate for students who require more specialised interventions. NEPS <i>Guidelines for Schools on Responding to Critical Incidents<\/i>provide advice for schools in handling critical incidents and also advises about prevention and early intervention strategies for students at risk.  <\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills promotes a comprehensive and whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health focusing on the entire school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified need.  <\/p><p>As Minister for Education and Skills, I attended the annual conference of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors (IGC) in Letterkenny last month. I am keenly aware of the issues and challenges facing young people today and the valuable role played by the school guidance counselling service as an integral part of the school&rsquo;s pastoral care and student support structures to promote student wellbeing at whole-school level.

The European-wide HSE supported, Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the <i>Well-being Guidelines<\/i>show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice.

There are currently 8 universities in the State, the most recent being the establishment of Technological University Dublin under the Technological Universities Act 2018 on 1 January 2019.  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 states that there is no case for the establishment of any new universities in Ireland on the basis set out in Section 9 of the Universities Act 1997.  The National Strategy also states that smaller, stand-alone institutions such as individual Institutes of Technology (IoTs) lack the scale required to deliver necessary advances in quality and efficiency and recommends consolidation within the IoT sector and a pathway of evolution for consolidated IoTs to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against stated performance criteria and to become multi-campus technological universities (TUs). <\/p>  <p>  Government policy as set out in the Programme for Government is to support the creation of TUs as higher education institutes (HEIs) of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to have a significant impact at regional, national and international level. These regional HEIs will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on the capacity to create and retain jobs in regions. As such, Government will prioritise those institutions which have clear ambitions and plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has provided the enabling legislation in the Technological Universities Act 2018 for two or more IoTs to come together to seek TU status. The Technological Universities Act 2018 which was signed into law on 19 March 2018 provides the legal framework underpinning the process for establishment by two or more IoTs as a TU subject to a decision-making process contingent on the meeting of specified eligibility criteria and including assessment by an international advisory panel. The 2018 Act also sets out the functions and governance requirements for these new HEIs. Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by two or more institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU. Section 38 of the Act provides that an institution and an established TU may also apply to the Minister for such an order.<\/p>  <p>  Government also continues to support those consortia of IoTs seeking to achieve TU status under the legislation in terms of significant Exchequer co-funding, with the latest funding call for a total of &euro;14 million in respect of TU development and other higher education landscape restructuring projects having issued from the Higher Education Authority on 29 March 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The potential benefits of becoming a successful TU are significant in terms of increased reach, international recognition, research capacity building, FDI attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experience and opportunities and socio-economic progression. The merging of institutes of technology will create institutions of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to maximise those benefits and attract greater investment. <\/p>  <p>  TUs will be distinguished by a mission and ethos that is aligned and consistent with the current mission and focus of IoTs with an emphasis on programmes at Levels 6 to 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), industry focused research and the development and use of new knowledge through industry-focused research. However, TUs will also offer post-graduate programmes at Levels 9 and 10 on the NFQ. <\/p>  <p>  TUs will help retain talent in the regions by strengthening the offer available to students who will be able to continue to masters and postgraduate level, including PhDs. Larger management and academic teams permitted by the merger of institutions will increase institutional capacity and will facilitate enhanced performance in areas such as winning research funding. <\/p>  <p>   TUs will also be expected to play a pivotal role in facilitating access and progression particularly through relationships with the further education and training sector. The presence of a technological university in a region, with a specific mandate for promoting regional development, will have a transformative effect on local and regional communities. By creating institutions of increased scale and capacity, multi-campus TUs will bring greater social and economic benefits to their regions through a strengthened role in research and innovation and the delivery of a broad range of high quality education and training in each of their campuses. <\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the progress made with existing consortia and from international exemplars that there is very considerable coherence in sectoral and educational offerings that make a single HEI hub both a catalyst and a magnet for regional economic development and employment. The strong regional mission of TUs to support development and innovation is aligned with the objectives of Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework. Enhanced HEIs will deliver the skilled and talented people that sustain enterprise and new investments. The National Development Plan 2018 - 2027 cites as a priority the establishment of a clearly prioritised Exchequer-supported higher education building programme including the objective of bolstering the capacity of multi-campus TUs. The current TU development consortia are referenced under Project Ireland 2040 as having a role in deepening the talent pool for distinctive regional clusters and driving research and innovation. TUs will also be well placed to attract increased research funding and to bid for a share of the &euro;4 billion in funding available as part of Project Ireland 2040 over the period 2019 &ndash; 2027 under the four broad themes of rural development, urban development, climate action and disruptive technology. <\/p>  <p>  On 1 January 2019 the first TU in the State, Technological University Dublin, which formerly comprised Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown and Institute of Technology Tallaght, was established under the Technological Universities Act 2018. With some 28,000 students, Technological University Dublin became the largest HEI in the State. <\/p>  <p>  On 12 February 2019 the Munster Technological University consortium, comprising Cork IT and IT Tralee, submitted an application to the Minister for Education and Skills seeking TU status under the 2018 Act.

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.<\/p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  <\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fair allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the level of need in each school. <\/p><p>Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. <\/p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website<i>www.ncse.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>Schools are advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019. An appeal can be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. <\/p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019\/20 school year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>Additional special education teaching allocations will be made for schools who have increased enrolments to the extent that they achieve developing status, once school enrolments have been verified at October 2019, as opposed to being based on projected enrolments. As the actual enrolments must be taken account of, this process cannot take place until the new school year is underway.<\/p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  <\/p><p>As revised updated allocations have recently been issued to schools, this process will recommence in September 2019. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.<\/p><p>This Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8bn being spent annually, about &euro;1 in every 5 of the education budget.<\/p><p>There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.<\/p><p>There are therefore more special education teachers in schools now than we have ever had previously. <\/p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800060#WRM07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":735,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800060#WRM07200"},{"type":"question","counter":736,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[18692\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800060#WRM07300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when funding will be allocated for a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":737,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has been devolved for delivery to Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board (MSLETB).<\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently given approval for the project to proceed to Construction Stage.

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post primary to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects such as STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish and Home Economics.<\/p>  <p>  In response to these difficulties, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in March 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group is considering the issues that relate to teacher supply under four policy headings: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data\/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility\/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. It is supported in its work by the Teacher Supply Implementation Group and a number of working groups that are looking at specific policy areas. In undertaking its task, the Steering Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group is overseeing the Action Plan for Teacher Supply, which I published in November 2018 with twenty-two actions in the four policy areas. Actions include: <\/p>  <p>  - My Department has published Circular 0015\/2019 with details of a new teacher sharing scheme for post-primary schools, commencing in the 2019\/20 school year. <\/p>  <p>  - Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), a number of higher education institutions (HEIs) will provide new post primary initial teacher education (ITE) undergraduate programmes in 2019 in priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages and Irish. The HEIs also plan to commence more new undergraduate ITE programmes in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  - The HEA is engaging with HEIs to explore the development of programmes to upskill existing teachers in targeted post primary subject areas and to examine the potential for flexible ITE programmes. <\/p>  <p>  - In the current academic year, an additional &euro;1m has been allocated to the Student Assistance Fund for Professional Master of Education students, increasing the overall fund to &euro;10.1m. <\/p>  <p>  - The Teaching Council is undertaking a review of the implementation of the guidelines for student teacher school placements. <\/p>  <p>  - At primary level, I recently announced the creation of six substitute teacher panels for schools in urban and rural areas. This pilot scheme will see up to 18 teachers hired on full-time contracts. Each teacher will be based in one school and rotate among up to 15 other schools as part of a cluster, with the potential for the scheme to cover 90 schools. <\/p>  <p>  - An online substitute teacher recruitment portal is being developed. It is intended that the portal will be in place for the next school year. <\/p>  <p>  - For the 2018\/19 school year, the restrictions on the number of days that teachers on career break may be employed were suspended. <\/p>  <p>  - The Teaching Council is developing more streamlined processes for the registration of teachers qualified in jurisdictions outside the State. <\/p>  <p>  - In December 2018, a national campaign to promote the teaching profession was launched across a number of platforms, including radio and digital media, supported by a new &lsquo;Teaching Transforms&rsquo; webpage providing information about teaching as a career. <\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group and the various working groups reporting to it continue to meet on a regular basis and I hope to be in a position to announce further developments in this area over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":756,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN01700"},{"type":"question","counter":757,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[18711\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of prefabs and portakabins in use at primary and second level schools here.","asker":"1440","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":758,"content":"<p>If the Deputy can clarify where she is referring to I will be happy to provide the information requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[18712\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount spent on prefabs and portakabins at primary schools here.","asker":"1440","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>If the Deputy can clarify where she is referring to I will be happy to provide the information requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":763,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[18713\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of prefabs and portakabins being used for classroom accommodation by primary schools in counties Laois and Offaly.","asker":"1440","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":764,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that it is the over all policy of my Department to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.

The SPHE curriculum is divided up into strands and strand units for each two-year class grouping (junior and senior infants, first and second class, third and fourth class, fifth and sixth class). One of the strands, Myself, has a strand unit called Safety and Protection in which personal safety and safety issues are explored.  <\/p>  <p>  Under personal safety, at junior and senior infants level, the child should be enabled to explore appropriate safety strategies; identify situations and places that are safe and those where personal safety might be at risk; and explore how accidents might be prevented at home, in school, on the farm, or in the water.  Under safety issues, the child should be enabled to identify people who are responsible for safety in the community and learn and practise safety strategies for crossing the road, using the bus or being a pedestrian; and realise and understand that rules are necessary in order to protect people and keep them safe.   <\/p>  <p>  The spiral nature of the curriculum means that the understanding and learning of the child progressively develops.  By fifth and sixth class, under personal safety, the child should be enabled, inter alia, to explore rules and regulations at home, in school and in society and the importance of adhering to them; identify situations and places that may threaten personal safety; and discuss a variety of risky situations and behaviour and assess and evaluate how these risks may be avoided or minimised and the implications of taking risks etc.  Under safety issues, the child should be enabled to recognise places where it is safer to play and how to behave in a responsible manner when playing;  know how to keep safe when travelling; and develop responsible attitudes towards the prevention of accidents and know what to do in the event of an accident etc.  <\/p>  <p>  While the specific issue of using phones while crossing the road is not stated in the curriculum, the spiral nature of the curriculum ensures that pupils will progressively develop a broader understanding of personal safety and safety issues such as crossing the road, and should be equipped with the necessary skills to do so safely.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Road Safety Authority is responsible for ensuring Irish schools and colleges have the support and resources they need to promote road safety. Educating road users about road safety is one of the priorities of the Government&rsquo;s Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012. The Strategy acknowledges that education plays a crucial role in permanently reducing deaths and injuries on Irish roads. Raising awareness and increasing understanding of road safety issues among schoolchildren and college students is one of the primary targets of the Strategy&rsquo;s action plan. Since the Strategy was published in 2007, the RSA has implemented a comprehensive integrated road safety education programme in pre-school, primary, post-primary, third level and in the community. This has been done in partnership with many organisations including the Department of Education and Skills, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health and Safety Authority and the Higher Education Authority. As part of this, the RSA has developed a range of material that teachers can use to educate school children about road safety as it applies to all road users &ndash; pedestrians, motorcyclists, cyclists and motorists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":777,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN03800"},{"type":"question","counter":778,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[18754\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a school transport service (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":779,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[19489\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800061#WRN04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application for school transport by a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":780,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 and 348 together.<\/p><p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department. <\/p><p>There are currently over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs,  transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. <\/p><p>In general children are eligible for school transport if they meet the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school. <\/p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that the children from the area referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for school transport as they are either not attending their nearest school or do not meet the distance criteria under the school transport scheme. <\/p><p>Children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation for the 2019\/20 school year.<\/p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and will be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated.<\/p><p>In cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language.

The review is available on the SOLAS website <i>www.solas.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>Work is already under way in many of the areas identified for action and SOLAS will lead implementation of the actions, working closely with apprenticeship partners and stakeholders, in particular employers, education and training providers and apprentices themselves.<\/p><p>The areas highlighted for action include setting disability and socio economic targets, incorporating the national census questions on disability and ethnicity into apprentice registration as a means of gathering more robust data on participation and examining options to expand the bursary which is currently available to employers who employ females in craft apprenticeships.<\/p><p>Increasing practical supports for apprentices from under-represented groups, creating new pathways via pre-apprenticeship courses around the country and promoting diverse pathways to participation in apprenticeship in the Generation Apprenticeship campaign are also identified as areas for action.

NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.

These school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.<\/p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.

The objective of the Working Group is to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, and recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue. <\/p>  <p>  The Group published its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in January 2017 and its Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018. As the Deputy will also be aware, this is an area also for consideration under the Civil Liability (Capping of General Damages) Bill 2019 that was introduced by Senator Anthony Lawlor as a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill in the Seanad on 6th March 2019 where it has since completed Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In response to recommendation 5 of the January 2018 Report of the CIWG, the Law Reform Commission is now carrying out a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries.  This forms part of the Commission&rsquo;s Fifth Programme of Law Reform approved by the Government on 20 March 2019.  It is my understanding that the Law Reform Commission has given this project its immediate attention with the aim of publishing an issues paper in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  As emerged in the course of the Working Group's deliberations, this is an area of the law replete with complex constitutional and legal issues.  The Working Group also recognised that a fundamental consideration in any analysis of this issue is whether a legislative cap on damages, or a similar measure, is necessary for the common good. At the same time, these aspects have to be balanced by the rights of genuine plaintiffs to an appropriate level of compensation. In short, the Working Group recognised that the State must be cognisant of the constitutional rights of all parties and must balance those rights to ensure any encroachment on them is justified, proportionate and in the common good.  <\/p>  <p>  The Personal Injuries Commission, which was established in January 2017, has also presented two reports over an 18-month work programme with a particular focus on soft-tissue, or whiplash, injuries.  The Commission concluded that these types of injury account for a large proportion of claims by volume in Ireland.  In its second report, the Commission presented the results of a benchmarking exercise which reveals that the level of general damages for soft tissue, or whiplash, injuries in this jurisdiction runs at a multiple of 4.4 times that of England and Wales. The Commission Chairperson, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, stated that this information is such as to confirm publically expressed concerns about such levels of award and the effect they may be having on motorists and businesses who require insurance cover.  The Commission Chairperson also referred to the detailed analysis which the Law Reform Commission has been asked to undertake in relation to possible legislation in this area and expressed the view that the Commission is best positioned and best resourced to advise further in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The possible introduction of legislation to cap insurance awards has, therefore, been taken in hand by the Government as part of its deliberations and programme of action under both the CIWG and the Personal Injuries Commission. This will now be supported by the necessary inputs and expertise of the Law Reform Commission. Together, these measures will inform any further steps which may be taken, including in terms of what possible legislative or other measures may be considered appropriate and with due regard to the relevant legal and constitutional aspects to which I have referred. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as part of its findings, the Personal Injuries Commission recommended that the future Judicial Council be assigned the function, under its statute, of compiling guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury, and that pending introduction of such legislation, the judiciary participate with representatives of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and my Department in the formulation of guidelines as to quantum in the case of claims for damages for soft tissue\/whiplash injuries. These are matters on which I am in on-going discussion with the Chief Justice and the Attorney General while I will also be bringing forward appropriate amendments to the Judicial Council Bill, which has just completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800067#WRT02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":1176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800067#WRT02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1177,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[19022\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800067#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the legislation in place to prevent the grooming of children.","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1178,"content":"<p>The Government takes the issue of sexual exploitation of children very seriously and there is comprehensive legislation in place to deal with these offences. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act was enacted in early 2017. It is a wide-ranging piece of legislation, which significantly enhances laws to combat the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.  Specific offences have been provided for in this Act to target the recognised steps in what is often a gradual process of grooming a victim.<\/p>  <p>  Among the provisions of the 2017 Act are measures to strengthen significantly the existing criminal law in combatting child exploitation and, in particular, to address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool which may lead to child sexual exploitation. <\/p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that sophisticated grooming often involves seemingly innocent contact with, or befriending of, a child, perhaps through text messaging, social media or messaging apps. This may be followed by the exposure of the child to sexual images or content.  Section 8 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides for a specific offence of using information and communications technology to communicate with a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  The new offence will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring to justice online predators and carries a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment.   <\/p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Sexual Offences Act 2017 also includes an offence of sending sexually explicit material to a child.  This is in recognition that the intention behind this type of activity may be to expose the child to such material with a view to developing the child&rsquo;s familiarity with such material or activity so as to facilitate the production of pornography or to meet the child for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The penalty for this offence is up to 5 years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will also be aware that child trafficking and exploitation (including the production of child pornography) are criminalised under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, as amended by Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 amended the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 to raise the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child who is under the age of 17 years from 5 to 7 years' imprisonment.

It was agreed that this group would meet on-demand depending on the direction of work.<\/p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously in this House, the main outcome of the initial meeting was to seek formal legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in relation to a number of legislative areas, to ascertain whether current legal provisions are sufficient or whether new provisions, or amendments to current provisions, are required to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, without giving rise to any unintended negative legislative consequences.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Rock on 10 April, I outlined that, once the legal advice was received and considered in detail by Government officials, the group was reconvened on a more focused basis on 15 March 2019. The main purpose of this meeting was to consider any legislative requirements, in light of the advices, with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It was agreed by those attending that current legislative provisions are sufficient. Of course, it remains open to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to contact the Department in the event that any legislative gaps are identified.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to recommendations of the group; in the absence of a need for new legislation, it is envisaged that an effective response to this behaviour will be informed by a combination of targeted enforcement measures, awareness-raising, and youth engagement programmes. These measures will be progressed in conjunction with the relevant Departments and agencies. <\/p>  <p>  Again, I must emphasise that policing this issue is a complex matter, due to the difficulties Garda&iacute; experience when attempting to intercept offenders who are in breach of current laws. Interception poses considerable risks to not only the rider, but also to the intercepting Garda and persons in the vicinity. However, I remain committed to finding solutions with our partners, and will provide further updates to this House when the conclusions arising from this process become available.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to reiterate the comments of Mr Keith Synnott, consultant at the National Spinal Injuries Unit in the Mater hospital, who last week stated that these vehicles are not toys; they are heavy, dangerous pieces of machinery that can cause life-changing injuries or death. I would appeal to the family members, and friends, of those who use these vehicles in urban environments to be aware of the catastrophic consequences that can unfold when using these vehicles in a public place. While there is considerable danger to the rider, members of the community, young and old, who are entitled to enjoy our public spaces in a safe and peaceful manner, are also at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800067#WRT06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Staff","counter":1215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800067#WRT06700"},{"type":"question","counter":1216,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[18583\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800067#WRT06800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to ongoing concerns by prison staff regarding bullying and having to work excessive hours without appropriate breaks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1217,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Irish Prison Service that they are not aware of any prison staff working without being in receipt of any breaks.<\/p>  <p>  All prison grades work an average 39 hour rostered week.

Applicants then cook the food at either communal or individual cooking stations.  <\/p><p>Independent living provides applicants with a significant degree of autonomy and prepares them for life after the protection process.  As of early April 2019, over 2,200 applicants across eight centres can avail of the independent living model.In addition, almost 1,400 other applicants have access to other self-catering facilities with food provided by the contractor or the applicant themselves.  The Department of Justice and Equality anticipates that all of the centres under contract to it will have moved to the independent living model by mid-2020.<\/p><p>In addition, there have been significant improvements to recreation opportunities, such as the provision of outdoor sports pitches, including &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities, teenagers rooms and family living rooms in centres to provide social areas for particular age groups.  Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.<\/p><p>A Standards Advisory Group was established in 2017.  The role of this group was to develop a set of standards for accommodation for those seeking international protection.  The group consisted of representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the NGO community and former residents.  The national standards will meet the standards set out in the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive and will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights as defined by the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty.<\/p><p>The Government decision to opt-in to the Recast Reception Conditions Directive is a significant and positive measure, not only in addressing the matter of labour market access, but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision.  In addition, any complaints about accommodation and related matters can be made to the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children as appropriate. <\/p><p>The nature of international protection is that it is demand led and accordingly the State must provide sufficient accommodation to meet that demand.

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.<\/p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally. These procedures are continually evolving arising from, for example, service improvements due to the introduction of new technology and updated work practices.<\/p><p>In general, it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.<\/p><p>Specifically, the average processing time from the date an application was received on to the date a decision was made was 6.7 months in 2016, 7.2 months in 2017 and 6.5 months in 2018. Additional security checks can result in some applications taking longer than this average timescale. Such checks are fundamental to maintaining the legitimacy of the naturalisation process both nationally and internationally.<\/p><p>In addition, processing timescales can be impacted due to incomplete applications having to be returned, further documentation being required from the applicant, or where payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department. Sometimes the input of several government agencies, both within and without this jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Delays can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered.  In other instances the applicant themselves may request that their application is put on hold.<\/p><p>The INIS Service Improvement Plan 2018-2020 commits the INIS to significant investment in technological developments including the roll-out of online forms and payments for citizenship applications.

It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and is, as I am sure you will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly. My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding sharing of vetting between organisations, vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Act provides for the sharing of vetting disclosures in certain circumstances by registered organisations; a facility which is of assistance in the health and education sectors, for example, in reducing the need for multiple vetting applications. Section 12(3A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of a person to undertake relevant work or activities, thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda vetting at present. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-vetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received. Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online. Furthermore, in circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":1241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1242,"qnumday":456,"qnumall":"[18628\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners that have been questioned and charged by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for possession of contraband within the prison estate throughout 2018 and the first quarter of 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1243,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities on this matter and I will contact the Deputy directly when the report is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1245,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[18662\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons that have been arrested for fraud in connection with medical certificates to cover for days a person was absent from work in each of the years 2000 to 2018, inclusive, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1246,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities on this matter and I will contact the Deputy directly when the report is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Fraud","counter":1247,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1248,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[18716\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures he has put in place to reduce the number of fraudulent motor insurance claims here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1249,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established by the Minister for Finance in July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The CIWG's Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017 and insurance fraud is one of the key themes of the report.

Enhancing cooperation between the insurance industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was also recommended (Recommendation 26).<\/p>  <p>  The Insurance Fraud Database Working Group, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality, met most recently in March to further discuss the establishment of the proposed database, following consideration of data protection issues over the past year.

As the Deputy will be aware, the focal point of this reform is the Cost of Insurance Working Group which was established by the Government in July 2016 and is chaired by Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy TD. The objective of the Working Group has been to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, and recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs. It brings together all relevant Offices and Departments, has conducted extensive consultations with stakeholders and set-up a dedicated Fraud Roundtable to give more detailed consideration to that particular issue.<\/p><p>The Working Group published its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in January 2017 and its Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018. In its conclusions, the Working Group was of the view that appropriate use of the legislative provisions contained in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 could be facilitated by encouraging industry to more actively pursue complaints with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where they believe fraud to have featured in claims. The Group also believed that more could be done to establish stronger working links between the relevant stakeholders to allow for the fraudulent claims to be investigated, and where appropriate, prosecuted.  I can confirm that my own Department has taken follow-up action in respect of 17 of the recommendations arising from the Working Group's reports, a number of which also involve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service in their on-going delivery. As a result of this work, a range of direct measures are being taken by the Government to address insurance fraud in a more effective way, including under the anti-fraud provisions of the 2014 Act.<\/p><p>New Guidelines for the Reporting of Allegations of Fraudulent Insurance Claims to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, were published on 1 October 2018 to make it clear what insurance companies should do in response to suspected fraud in a personal injuries claim. A new insurance claim fraud category on the Garda PULSE system went live on 2 November 2018, which enables the production of better statistics. The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum now meet on a regular basis to discuss and act upon the issues concerned. The Insurance Fraud Database Working Group, which is chaired by my Department, is continuing its work with Insurance Ireland and the Garda authorities to establish an integrated insurance fraud database, which can identify patterns of such fraud.<\/p><p>In relation to insurance fraud investigation, while the Garda Commissioner has indicated his preference that, in principle, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be funded by any source other than the Exchequer, he is of the view that a divisional focus is preferable, insofar as the investigation of insurance fraud is concerned, as opposed to the establishment of a centralised investigation unit. This approach is aligned with the general divisional-focused Garda model going forward. These are matters on which my Department is in on-going engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and on which any relevant proposals will be given appropriate consideration by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.<\/p><p>As part of its findings, the Personal Injuries Commission recommended that the future Judicial Council be assigned the function, under its statute, of compiling guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury, and that pending introduction of such legislation, the judiciary participate with representatives of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and my Department in the formulation of guidelines as to quantum in the case of claims for damages for soft tissue\/whiplash injuries. These are matters on which I am in on-going discussion with the Chief Justice and the Attorney General while I will also be bringing forward appropriate amendments to the Judicial Council Bill, which has just completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.<\/p><p>The Law Reform Commission is conducting a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries. This now forms part of the Commission&rsquo;s Fifth Programme of Law Reform approved by the Government on 20 March 2019. In its Final Report of July 2018, the Personal Injuries Commission, chaired by the former President of the High Court, Mr. Nicholas Kearns, noted this development deeming the Commission the appropriate body best equipped and resourced to do this.<\/p><p>The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 was commenced by Minister Paschal Donohoe on 28 January 2019. This legislation will provide a better understanding of those factors that influence the cost of insurance. The new Personal Injuries Assessment (Amendment) Act 2019 was commenced by Minister Heather Humphreys on 3rd April 2019 thereby reinforcing the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.<\/p><p>In conjunction with my own Department, an amendment has been made to section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to ensure defendants are notified of a claim having been lodged against their policy. This is now to be done within one month instead of the two-month period which previously applied by way of alignment with data protection legislation for the retention by businesses and employers of relevant CCTV footage. The court will draw inferences from a failure by a plaintiff to notify and can reflect this in the non-payment or reduction of an offending plaintiff&rsquo;s costs.  Similarly, an amendment has been made to section 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which deals with the matter of a verifying affidavit in a personal injuries action.The amendment provides that where there is a failure to lodge an affidavit by the set deadline, the court shall draw inferences and can reflect this in the non-payment or reduction of an offending plaintiff&rsquo;s costs.<\/p><p>It is increasingly evident, including as a result of the actions of the Cost of Insurance Working Group that I have outlined, that insurers are now making greater efforts under existing law to crack down on suspected fraudulent claims. There has also been a number of recent high-profile court judgements under which the legal consequences and sanctions arising from insurance fraud have been left in no doubt. We now have a series of mutually reinforcing measures in play that are intended, in their collective implementation, to give greater effect to the law and to the regulation of this area. We have to achieve this in a way that can better serve <i>bona fide<\/i>insurance consumers and legitimate claimants while deterring and penalising fraudsters. I would also continue to strongly encourage the insurance sector in taking a more determined approach to providing cover at affordable cost for those areas of enterprise, leisure and community activity that are experiencing difficulties in this regard at the present time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":1257,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1258,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[18736\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800068#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of unsolved murder and manslaughter cases here in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1259,"content":"<p>I have a sought a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the information sought by the Deputy.

Such licences are renewed annually.    <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the question of delegating functions to local authorities, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the performance of music and public entertainment in premises, irrespective of whether the premises are licensed for the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor, is regulated by Part IV of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1890.  Part IV of this Act applies to premises located in urban areas where an urban authority has adopted the appropriate provisions.  I understand that local authorities that have adopted Part IV include Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  Where Part IV applies, premises that are ordinarily used for public music or other entertainment of like kind must be licensed under the 1890 Act.  Such licences are issued by the District Court.<\/p>  <p>  In its Second Interim Report issued in July 2002, the Commission on Liquor Licensing concluded that the best and fairest way of dealing with licensing applications is through a court-based system.  It noted that such a system is transparent, fair and accessible.  It also noted that a court-based system is the best way of dealing with potentially contentious issues that require the balancing of rights of relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  I am, of course, aware of the current debate concerning the promotion and fostering of a more diverse and vibrant night time culture.  While I am in principle in favour of enhancements to current arrangements, I do not have immediate plans to amend the law in this area and any such changes to the law would, of course, require proper consultation with relevant stakeholders, including representative bodies, groups representing local residents, the local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also conscious that any change would need to be organised and managed in a manner that will not cause undue inconvenience or nuisance to local residents nor create an undue risk to public order.

In that regard the development of the local policing model is one of the priority projects being taken forward under A Policing Service for the Future in 2019. <\/p><p>A pilot design has already been implemented in four pilot divisions; Cork City, Dublin South Central, Galway and Mayo.  These pilots will help to refine this model to ensure that communities are served by a modern, highly professional, visible police service, which, going forward, I am confident will benefit areas such as Gorey and, more generally, the Wexford Division greatly, as an innovative and progressive way in which to police into the future. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware Gorey Garda Station now forms part of the Enniscorthy District in the Wexford Division following a restructuring of the Wexford Division from 4 to 3 districts and the Gorey district amalgamating with the Enniscorthy district.  This is more in line with the thinking behind the new district Policing model, as outlined in the CoFPI report, with its greater emphasis on frontline and community policing and district policing teams being large enough to provide a full community service. <\/p><p>The Garda strength of the Wexford Division on the 31st March 2019, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 329, of whom 126 are assigned to the Enniscorthy District with 52 of these assigned to Gorey Garda Station. There are also 15 Garda Reserves and 37 Garda civilian staff attached to the Wexford Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>The Garda strength by rank of the Wexford Division from 2009 to 31 March 2019 as provided by the Garda Commissioner is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following .<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 90 were assigned to the Wexford Division.<\/p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year.  The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. <\/p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities.

The new Tribunal will deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers and will replace the existing bodies which currently operate for that purpose and will be winding-down their existing caseloads.  Extensive preparations have been on-going at the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to put the necessary procedural, staffing, IT and other supports in place with the intention of being in a position to receive and process public complaints from early October 2019.  At that point, members of the public will no longer make their complaints through the legal professional bodies as they do at present but directly to the Authority and the new Disciplinary Tribunal will come into operation in its own right. <\/p>  <p>  The Legal Service Regulatory Authority's forthcoming actions are set out in its Strategic Plan for 2018-2020 which was duly laid before the Houses.  The Plan, under which the Authority is set to come into substantial operational mode from the middle of this year, sets out the indicative timelines for the roll-out of the Authority's key functions.  For example, the roll-out of new legal business models in the form of Legal Partnerships and of Limited Liability Partnerships is now due to take place in Quarter 2 of this year. <\/p>  <p>  This Autumn will also see the introduction of the new legal costs transparency regime set out in Part 10 of the 2015 Act including, separately, the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators which will maintain a publicly accessible Register of its legal costs determinations.  The new professional conduct regime being introduced under Part 6 will, therefore, underpin the new legal costs and other obligations that will apply to legal practitioners being regulated under the 2015 Act. As Minister I will, of course, continue to support the roll-out of these various functions with the timely commencement of the relevant provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800070#WRW05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":1411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800070#WRW05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1412,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[19570\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800070#WRW05800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of recruitment campaigns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in each of the past five years; the number of applications received in respect of each campaign; the number of persons that joined An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a result of the campaigns; when each of the processes concluded; if the applications received in November 2016 are still being assessed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1413,"content":"<p>Recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013.

The Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes in all prisons to those in custody, including those on sentences of ten years or over.  Those programmes include education, work training, healthcare, psychological, psychiatric, counselling, welfare and chaplaincy services, all of which can offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and can encourage them to lead law abiding lives on release.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Prison Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps people in custody cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. Broad programmes of education are provided which generally follow an adult education approach.  The Department of Education and Skills provides and funds an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons.<\/p>  <p>  Programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.

Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to upskill and to acquire practical accredited skills which will help them secure employment on release.  The provision of essential prison services such as catering, industrial cleaning and laundry services also form an important part of work training and skills development in all prisons.  <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds and the Guild of Cleaners and Launderers and the centralising of co-ordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Irish Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800071#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1454,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 531 and 532 answered with Question No. 527.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Provision","counter":1455,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800071#WRX02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1456,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[19667\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800071#WRX02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda cars available in each Tipperary Garda district in each of the years 2013 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form excluding road policing units; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1457,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles across the various Garda divisions are a matter for the Commissioner in the light of his identified operational demands and the availability of resources.

The recommendations in the report were accepted and my officials and officials from the Irish Prison Service have been in advanced discussions with the Ombudsman's office with the aim of establishing an effective complaints system for prisoners. <\/p>  <p>  In these discussions with the Ombudsman, it has been agreed that his engagement with the process will begin after the new complaints procedure has been introduced and bedded down as an internal IPS process in the first instance.

I can point to the range of informative research that my Department and its agencies have undertaken to inform how we best understand the impacts of Brexit and support enterprises that are likely to face particular challenges.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past two years, my Department has provided funding to InterTradeIreland (ITI) for a series of research reports undertaken by the ESRI on behalf of ITI. This research assessed the potential implications of Brexit for cross-border trade in four research stages. The first research report examined cross border trading patterns and the potential impacts on overall trade of the application of EU WTO tariffs, including the impact of Non-Tariff Barriers and changes to the euro-sterling exchange rate. The second report examined the patterns of cross-border trade on the island of Ireland, focusing on the role of supply chain links. This report showed that for over half (51%) of Irish exporters, Northern Ireland is the destination for more than 50% of their exports, while for just over 25% of Irish firms, Northern Ireland is the destination for more than 95% of their exports. It showed that Northern Ireland accounts for between 10-12% of total exports from Ireland to the UK as a whole and accounted for 7-8% of imports. A third report took an in-depth look at small firms participating in cross-border exporting; export performance; and determinants of export destinations for firms across the island of Ireland. Finally, a fourth report examined the capacity of firms to absorb shocks using detailed firm-level patterns of risk exposure across Ireland and Northern Ireland, providing insight into how dispersed across firms a post-Brexit shock to trade costs could be. This research has been made publicly available. <\/p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland also produce a comprehensive quarterly all-island survey, the All-Island Business Monitor, which tracks economic indicators such as business position, sales employment and other topical issues. The latest Business Monitor (Quarter 4, 2018) highlights the impact the uncertainty caused by Brexit is having on small and medium businesses, and particularly those engaged in cross-border trade. This research has helped ITI and my Department to better understand the potential impact of Brexit on firms across the island, especially those involved in cross-border trade, and informs our Brexit related work. The Government, through my Department, has provided an additional &euro;1 million in funding for 2019 to support this work, and will continue to liaise closely with the body to ensure it has the support it needs to support businesses at this time.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has undertaken extensive research to assess Brexit's potential implications for business, conducting a qualitative assessment on &ldquo;The firm-level impact of Brexit on Most Exposed Sectors&rdquo;, published in June 2018. The research, conducted jointly with Deloitte, engaged with firms, including some operating on an all-island basis, representing large, medium and small employers to get their insights on what would be their principal concerns if they were to be faced with a &lsquo;hard&rsquo; Brexit scenario. The findings indicate that the greatest level of concern relates to the free movement of goods, the re-emergence of a hard border and the possible imposition of tariffs on trade. The study highlighted that a no-deal Brexit would have serious implications across many aspects of a firm&rsquo;s operations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also previously commissioned research to model the implications of Brexit for the Irish economy and trade. This independent study undertaken by Copenhagen Economics on behalf of the Department, quantifies the impact of possible new barriers to trade which might emerge as a result of Brexit. The study considered a range of possible Brexit scenarios in order to determine the possible impact of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s trade performance (i.e. imports and exports), and ultimately on Irish GDP. The study examined the impacts on the Republic of Ireland only. All of the scenarios considered produce a result that is less favourable for Ireland than a non-Brexit scenario. Nevertheless, regardless of the scenario, the Irish economy is still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030 &ndash; Brexit has a dampening impact, however, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred<\/p>  <p>  The study analysed the impact of these scenarios across 24 sectors of the Irish economy. The impact of Brexit in five sectors was found to account for approximately 90 per cent of the total economic impact, these were Agri-Food; Pharma-Chemicals; Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail; Electrical Machinery; and Air Transport. <\/p>  <p>  The economies of Ireland and Northern Ireland are closely connected. An open border has allowed industries of all types to develop in both jurisdictions without constraints.

However, our Superior Courts have established that the Constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through legislation and by the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.  There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to support collective bargaining within the concept of voluntarism.  The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively are also guaranteed in a number of international instruments which the State has ratified and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law. <\/p>  <p>  A decision by this Government to legislate for an improved framework in this area resulted in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 1st   August 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed in employments where collective bargaining does not take place and brings clarity and certainty for employers in terms of managing their workplaces in this respect. <\/p>  <p>  Given this background, and the robust measures which have been put in place to support collective bargaining within a voluntarist industrial relations framework, the Government has no plans to legislate further on trade union recognition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800072#WRY04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Data","counter":1537,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800072#WRY04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1538,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[19071\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800072#WRY04300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the land and property acquired by IDA Ireland in 2017 and 2018; the price paid for the land and property, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":1539,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[19076\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800072#WRY04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the properties and land rented by IDA Ireland in 2018, in tabular form including overseas properties; the yearly rent paid per property; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1540,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 563 and 567 together.<\/p><p>It is important that the IDA has a supply of available properties that can be offered to firms considering making job-rich investments in Ireland, particularly for the regions.

This will help ensure that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging more FDI to the regions. The IDA plans to develop new buildings in regional locations including Carlow, Dundalk, Monaghan, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. These important initiatives are part of the IDA&rsquo;s Brexit response and specific Investment Priority Projects set out in our National Development Plan, &lsquo;Ireland 2040&rsquo; under National Strategic Outcome 5 &lsquo;Strong Economy Supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills&rsquo; which includes a commitment to the provision of further investment by the IDA in regional property solutions. <\/p><p>Almost &euro;7 million in additional funding has been provided to Enterprise Ireland in 2019. This will support the creation of new &lsquo;Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters&rsquo; via the Institutes of Technology, building their facilities, expertise and supportive capabilities as drivers of global enterprises in and across the regions. This is one of the priority projects as set out in &lsquo;Project 2040&rsquo;.  It will also allow EI to further progress its Global Footprint plans. This will involve the recruitment of additional staff and promotional\/training activities through targeted programmes such as; Irish Advantage, Online Customs training etc. The expansion of EI&rsquo;s global footprint is a key initiative of the Agency&rsquo;s Brexit response. <\/p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices have received a substantial increase of &euro;5 million in their Capital funding for 2019. This is in recognition of their pivotal role in developing and supporting competitive and innovative local businesses across the regions and particularly in supporting them to deal with the implications of Brexit.  The additional funding will allow the LEOs to build upon their specific strengths in furthering enterprise development and job creation in their local areas. Funding will be presented through competitive funding to maximise its potential in supporting high quality proposals for regional job creation.<\/p><p>The increases provided to the respective Enterprise Agencies demonstrated the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to ensure that they have the necessary resources to carry out their pivotal roles in getting business Brexit ready, driving indigenous enterprise and regional growth and preparing for the Future of Jobs in tomorrow&rsquo;s economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"InterTradeIreland Funding","counter":1602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1603,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[19363\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the companies supported by InterTradeIreland in 2018; the number of jobs supported by InterTradeIreland in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1604,"content":"<p>This year marks 20 years since InterTradeIreland (ITI) was founded.

In May 2018 a pilot quota based scheme of General employment permits for dairy farm assistants, horticulture workers and meat processing operatives was put in place to address the immediate needs of the sector.  The scheme allows workers from non-EEA countries to access employment opportunities with all employers in the sector who are seeking labour.  To date this pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector with a total of 1,378 out of the total quota of 1,500 permits for Meat Processing Operatives granted.  The application of a quota based system is to ensure that in the longer-term, strategies are put in place to source labour supply from both the domestic and European labour markets and to invest in innovative technologies for the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  Applications for employment permits are open to all employers, regardless of size or number of vacancies held, to seek a permit following submission of an application form and appropriate documents as required.  All applications for employment permits are processed in line with the Employment Permits Acts and associated Regulations which lay down in legislation the criteria in relation to the application and grant and refusal of an employment permit.  Applications are processed in date order. Under the Employment Permit Acts, the Minister may refuse an application where either the employer or employee has received a conviction under employment permit or employment rights legislation in the previous 5 years. <\/p>  <p>   In order to assist with the application process, the Department has produced a suite of information to assist in the application process including details on how to carry out the Labour Market Needs Test, a &lsquo;User Guide' to our online application system and a comprehensive FAQ Document which answers the most common queries received regarding employment permits.  My officials have also produced a checklist document specifically for Meat Processing Operatives which, if followed, should result in the granting of an employment permit.  This information can be found in the Employment Permits section of my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. <\/p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has no restrictions in place in relation to the sale of a home. However, if a participant in the Scheme were to sell an asset, such as a home, after their first financial assessment the proceeds of the sale would therefore become a cash asset. The three-year cap will then no longer apply and the participant must pay a contribution of 7.5% based on this cash asset.<\/p>  <p>  A participant in the scheme can request a financial review if 12 months have passed since their initial review. However, the HSE may review a financial assessment at any stage.<\/p>  <p>  Under the NHSS rental income is considered income for the purpose of the financial assessment of means and is assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions. <\/p>  <p>  Action 17 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector commits the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government (DHPLG) to examine the treatment under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme's financial assessment of income from the rental of a person's principal private residence where they move into long term residential care. The Department of Health is currently engaging with the DHPLG in this regard to examine the policy and legal implications on this issue. Any changes to the treatment of rental income under the Scheme require careful policy analysis and consideration and if changes were to be proposed primary legislation would be required to give effect to them. An analysis of the number, type and location of vacant homes arising from their owners entering long term care supported by the NHSS will form part of this collaborative work between the respective Departments. Work will continue on this area throughout 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Transfers","counter":1635,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1636,"qnumday":597,"qnumall":"[19269\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average, shortest and longest wait, respectively, facing a prisoner who is awaiting a transfer from the Irish Prison Service to the Central Mental Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1637,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug Treatment Programmes Funding","counter":1638,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1639,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[19336\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the ongoing drugs crisis in north County Wexford and that a group (details supplied) involved in the community response to the crisis has had its funding cut by 30%; his plans to address the crisis in the area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1303","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1640,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":1641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06800"},{"type":"question","counter":1642,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[19486\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ06900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question 102 of 30 January 2019, the position regarding the increase in public service pensions that has been sanctioned but not implemented; when pay increases to qualifying pensions will be applied in CHO 2; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1643,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Control Measures","counter":1644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ07100"},{"type":"question","counter":1645,"qnumday":600,"qnumall":"[19562\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800073#WRZ07200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the feasibility of introducing a licence system with a minimum annual fee of &euro;500 to be paid by tobacco retailers; the estimated costs associated with developing, maintaining and administering same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1362","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1646,"content":"<p>In 2014 the Government approved the development of a General Scheme of a Bill to provide for measures in relation to tobacco products and nicotine-inhaling products such as e-cigarettes.

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. The Minister for Health has no role in this statutory process. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the community drugs schemes, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).

This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics. Issues relating to gynaecology waiting lists will be examined as part of this process. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that the nature of outpatient waiting lists is such that they capture the numbers awaiting outpatient appointments by specialty, but cannot be used to determine medical diagnosis. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF further advise that they are unable to provide specific waiting times for inpatient\/daycase \"gynaecological services for investigation of ovarian cysts\", as the question does not relate to a specific procedure used specifically to investigate ovarian cysts.

Its recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of a recommendation by NIAC, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule was amended in 2016 to include the introduction of the Meningitis B vaccine for all babies born on or after 1 October 2016.  This change to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December 2016.  The first dose of the vaccine is administered to children when they reach two months of age; a second dose is administered at four months and a third and final dose at twelve months.  As Meningitis B disease is most common in babies under the age of 1 year old the scheduling of the administration of the vaccine under the immunisation programme takes account of this.  <\/p>  <p>  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the Men B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.  <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce a catch-up programme for the Men B vaccine to older children as NIAC has never recommended a catch up programme for children born before 1 October 2016.  However, parents may choose to have their older children vaccinated if they wish.  The purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme but those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered free of charge by their GP.  <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, Men B, Men C, PCV and Hib vaccines are offered to children as part of the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule to protect them against meningitis.  Adolescents in the first year of secondary school are also given a Men C booster vaccine against meningitis as part of the School Immunisation Programme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800075#WRBB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1742,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800075#WRBB01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1743,"qnumday":632,"qnumall":"[18507\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800075#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an ENT appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1744,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review.  These inputs are being considered in detail.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. <\/p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has no restrictions in place in relation to the sale of a home. However, if a participant in the Scheme were to sell an asset, such as a home, after their first financial assessment the proceeds of the sale would therefore become a cash asset.

The Department of Health is currently engaging with the DHPLG in this regard to examine the policy and legal implications on this issue. Any changes to the treatment of rental income under the Scheme require careful policy analysis and consideration, particularly with regard to any impact on the sustainability of the Scheme. If changes were to be proposed primary legislation would be required to give effect to them.

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p>  <p>  This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. Preparation of the report involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report was informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The report was informed by the personal experiences and concerns of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery, including through written representations to me and my Department, those concerns raised in Parliamentary Questions on this subject, and the issues raised by the Mesh Survivors Ireland group at its meeting with me on 14 June 2018. I acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown by the women I met and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were often harrowing, deeply personal experiences.<\/p>  <p>  The priority issues relating to patient care which were raised by women suffering complications and by others on their behalf are addressed in the report recommendations and are being addressed by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, were not formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, a number of women whose procedures were postponed wrote to me and my Department expressing concern at the impact that this is having on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p>  <p>  The Report makes 19 recommendations including:<\/p>  <p>  - the development of patient information and informed consent materials;<\/p>  <p>  - surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;<\/p>  <p>  - the development of clinical guidance;<\/p>  <p>  - the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;<\/p>  <p>  - ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and<\/p>  <p>  - ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.<\/p>  <p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented.<\/p>  <p>  A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  The Group includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. The HSE has advised that it is unable to facilitate membership on the Advisory Group to every patient or patient group who has a mesh experience. The NWIHP has sought to have a range of mesh experiences from the patient&rsquo;s perspective represented by a patient advocate on the Group &ndash; including patients who have had mesh with post-operative problems, patients who have had successful mesh surgery and patients who are on the waiting list for a mesh procedure.  The HSE advises that women who wish to submit views or submissions to the overall work of the Group should contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at smi.nwihp@hse.ie.<\/p>  <p>I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services.

Its provisions were given further effect to in the Data Protection Act 2018.  One important difference between the GDPR and the previous EU Data Protection Directive is that the GDPR Regulation expressly recognises genetic data as a special category of personal data deserving of a high level of protection.<\/p>  <p>   Mindful of the critical need to promote public confidence in how the health system treats all patient data but especially sensitive data like genetic data, I used the Regulation making power provided for in section 36 of the Data Protection Act to make, last August, the Health Research Regulations. <\/p>  <p>   The Health Research Regulations are a coherent statement of public policy in the health research area based on internationally accepted best practice information principles for those carrying out health research and strong and focused safeguards for those whose personal data is being processed for health research.  The collecting, use, storage and disclosure of genetic data for health research purposes is, therefore, not only governed by the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 but by the Health Research Regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  I also want to make the point that the preparation of the Regulations not only had full regard to the provisions of the GDPR but also to the Constitutional right to privacy, the Common Law duty of confidentiality between health professional and patient and the right to privacy provisions in and case law of  the European Convention on Human Right (ECHR).<\/p>  <p>  At the core of the Regulations are two related national and internationally accepted principles.  First, support for the longstanding principle of patient confidentiality as a key value in our health system.  Second, the promotion of patient empowerment in relation to their information to bring about a truly patient centred health service.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Regulations emphasise explicit consent of the data subject as the default position, provide for high levels of transparency which is a new core data protection principle and for information security controls to limit access to the personal data of individuals as well as controls to log who has accessed the data.  <\/p>  <p>  They also address the reality that those requirements for consent, transparency, security and other data subject&rsquo;s rights mean very little if there is no clarity on where the responsibility lies for complying with them.  That is why they tackle the crucial issue of the relationships between the institutions that hold the data being used in the research and the health researchers that carry out the research using that data.  The rules and requirements in the Regulations are very clear especially when it comes to third party disclosures.   Accordingly, all involved in a health research project must ensure that they know whether they are the data controller, a joint data controller or a data processor and comply fully not only with legal requirements but ethical ones too.   <\/p>  <p>  The consent declaration process provided for in the Regulations which is designed to facilitate publicly important health research where seeking consent is not possible -something found in other countries- is very tightly drawn and its criteria for when a consent declaration can be given is directed not only at GDPR considerations but also at the Common Law, Constitution and ECHR.  That was done to ensure that all relevant factors must be addressed both in the application for a consent declaration and in the consideration of that declaration.  It is the same reasoning that means that a declaration when granted can only ever extend to obtaining and using personal data required for the research or part of the research but such data cannot then be disclosed to anyone else without the consent of the data subject or a legal obligation to do so.  It is also important to emphasise that a consent declaration cannot be given where a data subject has refused his or her consent to the use of his or her personal information for the research involved.<\/p>  <p>  Everything that is provided for in the Health Research Regulations was subject to a series of discussions with the Data Protection Commission.  The rigorous nature of that consultation process provided a very useful stress test.  In particular, the Department and the Commission had careful regard to the issue of genetic data against the backdrop both of scientific developments in the genomics area and the GDPR requirement that genetic data, as a special category of sensitive personal data, is subject to strong safeguards. <\/p>  <p>  Health research is indisputably important to better patient care and the development of innovative and life-saving therapies.  As Minister for Health, I want to support health research and I believe most people do.  I believe that the best way to do so is to promote and sustain greater public confidence in research through enhanced openness, transparency and patient empowerment so that no individual is surprised by who has access to his or her personal data and the uses, including research, to which it is put.  Transparency and openness are especially important where it is proposed to share patient data with commercial third parties. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health does not have the power to give anyone permission to collect genetic data.  If publicly funded or private health facilities collect such data for patient care and treatment they must do so in accordance with date protection law which means complying with the core data protection principles in Article 5, having a legal basis in Article 6 and meeting an appropriate condition in Article 9.   They must also meet any ethical requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  If the facility wishes to use patient data collected for care and treatment for research to be carried out by the facility or to disclose it to a third party for that party to carry out research then they must also comply with the terms of the Health Research Regulations and explicit consent must be obtained and all the other safeguard required by the Regulations must be in place.  It is a similar situation where the facility acts an agent or partner of a third party in collecting genetic data for health research.<\/p>  <p>  Any publicly funded or private health facility holding patient data must ensure that it has proper governance in place that reflects and gives effect to its legal obligations.  Failure to adhere to proper governance may have significant consequences under law for the institutions and any employees or agents involved.  More widely, there will be collateral reputational damage affecting the health system generally. <\/p>  <p>  To go back to a point I made early in this answer, I am mindful of the critical need to promote public confidence in how the health system treats all patient data but especially sensitive data like genetic data.

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year.  The Joint Committee intends to report thereon before the summer recess and the recommendations in its report will be considered during the ongoing process of drafting this Bill in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the Scheme. Subject to certain conditions surrogacy will be available to people irrespective of gender, marital status or sexual orientation.<\/p>  <p>  The specific provisions relating to surrogacy are outlined in Part 6 of the General Scheme. These provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority, the establishment of which the Bill will provide for. The Scheme also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). <\/p>  <p>  In addition, under the surrogacy provisions at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child. Surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis where the payment of defined and receiptable reasonable expenses will be allowed. However, commercial surrogacy in Ireland will be prohibited as it raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates. <\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme does not regulate Irish citizens being involved in international commercial surrogacy agreements in other countries. However, the Department of Justice and Equality published a guidance document in 2012 on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel document issues in relation to children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements entered into outside the State. The purpose of this document is to provide information to prospective intending parents on the steps necessary to ensure that a child born abroad through a surrogacy arrangement may enter and reside in the State and to secure the best interests of the child. This guidance document is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800078#WREE05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospice Services Provision","counter":1995,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800078#WREE05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1996,"qnumday":725,"qnumall":"[18830\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800078#WREE05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) can remain at a hospice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1997,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800078#WREE05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1998,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800078#WREE06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1999,"qnumday":726,"qnumall":"[18832\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800078#WREE06100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the lack of ear, nose and throat services in the south east, specifically in University Hospital Waterford which has waiting lists of 24 to 36 months for initial appointments will be investigated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2000,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800078#WREE06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2002,"content":"<p>Question No. 727 answered with Question No. 716.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diabetes Strategy","counter":2003,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":2004,"qnumday":728,"qnumall":"[18849\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to establish a national diabetes register; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2005,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":2006,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":2007,"qnumday":729,"qnumall":"[18850\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of staff that have been recruited to operate the 40-bed modular unit proposed for South Tipperary General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2008,"content":"<p>As Minister for Health, I recognise that hospitals are increasingly operating at or above capacity, with year-round demand pressures that are further challenged over the winter months.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.   The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  In responding to patients needs, the HSE has implemented revised processes to provide a more compassionate and more efficient process in the assessment of medical card applications. Such measures include the development of a Burden of Illness questionnaire which is used in selective circumstances where the assessing doctor in the HSE's national medical card unit requires a more comprehensive assessment of an applicant's medical and social circumstances and any resulting undue financial hardship. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Coverage","counter":2024,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2025,"qnumday":735,"qnumall":"[18870\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which the criteria for long-term illnesses was decided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2026,"qnumday":736,"qnumall":"[18871\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800079#WRFF02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the long-term illnesses list will be reviewed or amended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2027,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 735 and 736 together.<\/p><p>The LTI Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended).

In this regard, I committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. <\/p><p>The joint Department of Health\/HSE\/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published recently and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing wait times for inpatient\/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan will place a strong focus on a number of high-volume procedures, including tonsillectomies and septoplasties. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these procedures.<\/p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and in this regard the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics. Issues relating to gynaecology waiting lists will be examined as part of this process.<\/p><p>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, the IPDC and OPD waiting lists for ENT at University Hospital Waterford (UHW) are set out in the attached document. As of the end of March 2019 there were 407 patients waiting for an IPDC ENT procedure. This represents a decrease of 33% on the same period last year when there were 605 patients waiting. In terms of outpatients, as of the end of March there were 9,021 patients waiting for an appointment. <\/p><p>UHW have been working with the NTPF to arrange treatment and appointments for long-waiting patients as part of the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019. In particular, the NTPF advise that 75 tonsils procedures and 800 Outpatient appointments have been approved for UHW. Of which, to date, 352 outpatient appointments have been arranged, of which 304 patients seen for ENT. The NTPF have also worked with UHW to offer outsourced treatment to 29 ENT patients, while 220 tonsil procedures have been in-sourced (91 child tonsils; 129 adult tonsils).  <\/p><p>In relation to further actions being taken to reduce the waiting time for ENT patients at UHW, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<table><tr><th>IPDC<\/th><th>0-3 Mths<\/th><th>3-6 Mths<\/th><th>6-9 Mths<\/th><th>9-12 Mths<\/th><th>12-15 Mths<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Otolaryngology (ENT)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Latest<\/td><td>132<\/td><td>102<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Last Year<\/td><td>172<\/td><td>117<\/td><td>79<\/td><td>81<\/td><td>67<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>YoY Var<\/td><td>-40<\/td><td>-15<\/td><td>-48<\/td><td>-37<\/td><td>-38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>YoY Var %<\/td><td>-23.26%<\/td><td>-12.82%<\/td><td>-60.76%<\/td><td>-45.68%<\/td><td>-56.72%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Table contd.<table><tr><th>IPDC<\/th><th>15-18 Mths<\/th><th>18-24 Mths<\/th><th>24-36 Mths<\/th><th>Grand Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Otolaryngology (ENT)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Latest<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>407<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Last Year<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>605<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>YoY Var<\/td><td>-16<\/td><td>-8<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>-198<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>YoY Var %<\/td><td>-40.00%<\/td><td>-18.60%<\/td><td>66.67%<\/td><td>-32.73%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th>OPD<\/th><th>0-3Months<\/th><th>3-6Months<\/th><th>6-9Months<\/th><th>9-12Months<\/th><th>12-15Months<\/th><th>15-18Months<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019-03-28<\/td><td>1447<\/td><td>900<\/td><td>767<\/td><td>831<\/td><td>768<\/td><td>799<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>29\/03\/2019<\/td><td>1390<\/td><td>939<\/td><td>805<\/td><td>798<\/td><td>857<\/td><td>815<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Table contd.<table><tr><th>OPD<\/th><th>18-21Months<\/th><th>21-24Months<\/th><th>24-36Months<\/th><th>36-48Months<\/th><th>48+Months<\/th><th>Grand Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019-03-28<\/td><td>552<\/td><td>550<\/td><td>1445<\/td><td>953<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9021<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>29\/03\/2019<\/td><td>791<\/td><td>938<\/td><td>1519<\/td><td>105<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>8957<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800080#WRGG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Data","counter":2090,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800080#WRGG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2091,"qnumday":758,"qnumall":"[18948\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800080#WRGG02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE will engage as a matter of urgency with persons (details supplied).","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2092,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives. <\/p>  <p>  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800080#WRGG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":2093,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800080#WRGG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2094,"qnumday":759,"qnumall":"[18949\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800080#WRGG02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding will be made available to construct a facility to house the MRI scanner at St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny;

The letter of 23rd July 2015 clearly indicated that the Rosalie Unit would continue to be part of HSE healthcare provision for Roscommon in the future. There has been no change to that position.<\/p>  <p>  The current position in regard to this unit is that, arising from the recommendations of a recent clinical independent report, the HSE recently commenced the process of arranging alternative and more appropriate care options for the residents of Rosalie Unit. Extensive and detailed consultations have been and are ongoing with local representatives and stakeholders on all relevant issues. <\/p>  <p>  As I, and the HSE, have indicated on many occasions the way forward for the residents of Rosalie has been based solely on clinical and independent conclusions of health professionals. The recent decision on Rosalie also reflects the findings of the Review of the Mental Health Service in Roscommon, undertaken in 2017 to modernise provision in that area. <\/p>  <p>  I have always encouraged public representatives and the media to take a responsible approach when commenting on the HSE decision to transfer patients residing at Rosalie to more appropriate health facilities to better meet their changing health care needs. <\/p>  <p>  In the wider context, it is important to note that the Rosalie Unit will not close.

Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. <\/p><p>The joint Department of Health\/HSE\/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published recently and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient\/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges, as well as 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. <\/p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and in this regard the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community and maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics. Issues relating to benign gynaecology waiting lists will be examined as part of this process.<\/p><p>Waiting list figures provided to my Department by the NTPF indicate that at the end of March 2019 there were 421 patients on the Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) IPDC waiting list. Of these, 60% are waiting 6 months or less and 74% are waiting 9 months or less.<\/p><p>CUMH continues to work on reducing the inpatient and outpatient waiting list with a focused plan to reduce long waiters. With the support of South\/South-West Hospital Group and the NTPF, CUMH have worked to offer treatment to long waiting patients, and have arranged additional outpatient clinics. The benefit of these initiatives can be witnessed in the waiting list numbers. <\/p><p>The CUMH outpatient waiting list for March 2019 recorded a 50% reduction in the numbers waiting for an appointment compared to the same period last year. More specifically, at the end of March 2019 there were 1,854 patients waiting for an appointment.

The NPHET has also driven enhanced surveillance of HCAIs and built capacity within the system for the challenges associated with these threats. Guidance documents have been developed by the Expert Group convened by the NPHET which provide expert advice to hospitals and the community health care services regarding actions that should be taken regarding CPE screening and control of spread of CPE.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has allocated significant targeted funding of &euro;7 million to increase our public health system&rsquo;s capacity to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and healthcare-associated infections, including the superbug CPE.  This includes &euro;2 million allocated in 2018 and a further &euro;5 million for 2019.  This funding will help to ensure a sustainable response by building infection prevention and control teams both in hospitals and in the community to reduce the spread of infection and disease, enhance surveillance and optimise the use of antimicrobials such as antibiotics.<\/p>  <p>  The next phase of work will focus on the HSE's further implementation of measures to address CPE and other HCAIs to ensure a coherent operational response. My Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together on this important issue. This is also in line with the priorities identified under Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020.<\/p>  <p>  CPE means a type of bacteria that lives in the gut and is resistant to almost all antibiotics.  If CPE stay in the gut they are mostly harmless and this is called colonisation.  Only a small number of people who are colonised with (carry) CPE will go on to develop an invasive CPE infection.<\/p>  <p>  Under Infectious Diseases Regulations, invasive CPE infection has been a notifiable disease since September 2011 and cases are reported through the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) publishes national data on invasive CPE infections since 2012.  In 2017 there were 14 notifications of invasive CPE infections and in 2018 there were 16 notifications.  Published data for 2019 reports that there were two notifications of invasive CPE infection up to the end of February.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the enhanced surveillance of CPE established via the NPHET, the HPSC now publishes a monthly CPE surveillance report.  This surveillance report includes national data on rates of CPE infection and colonisation as well as data on outbreaks, screening and other related information.

However, patients who have a valid medical prescription for medical cannabis and a Ministerial licence and who have sourced a cannabis-based product may submit an application to the HSE for reimbursement approval. <\/p>  <p>  If approval is given, the PCRS, when authorised to proceed, will make the necessary arrangements to cover the costs involved for the patient. <\/p>  <p>  Three patients have a Ministerial licence and have been approved by the HSE for their product and travel costs to the Netherlands.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to advise their policy for reimbursement of CBD products and will advise the Deputy as soon as this information is received. The number of families using CBD oil is not known.<\/p>  <p>  Until suitable medical cannabis products are made available in Ireland, prescribers and their patients are sourcing the prescribed product from a pharmacy in The Netherlands, on foot of their medical prescription. Due to current Netherlands government policy, Bedrocan products, sold as cannabis oil formulations, are not currently permitted to be commercially exported from the Netherlands, but are only supplied in the Netherlands on foot of a valid medical prescription when presented to the appropriate pharmacy.<\/p>  <p>  A second pathway for access to medical cannabis is being established, through the Medical Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP). Good progress is being made in establishing the Access Programme but it is not yet in operation. The Programme aims to facilitate access to certain &lsquo;acceptable&rsquo; cannabis products which have not been authorised as medicines by a statutory Medicines Competent Authority. Availability of cannabis products that are of an appropriate quality standard and are affordable to patients is critical in establishing the access programme. <\/p>  <p>  Department officials are working intensively on finding solutions to the supply of appropriate products for Irish patients. <\/p>  <p>  Medical practitioners, patients and interested parties are encouraged to consult the Department of Health website which contains information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis and details on how a medical practitioner may apply for a Ministerial licence for medical cannabis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2577,"qnumday":931,"qnumall":"[19588\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment in UHK for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2578,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

As such, medical cannabis products will not be distributed without a prescription at licensed pharmacists, and it is not envisaged that companies other than licensed pharmacists will engage in retail sales of medical cannabis.<\/p><p>In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time. <\/p><p>To date licences have been issued in respect of twenty individual patients under this provision of the Act.<\/p><p>It is intended that the Ministerial licence application scheme will continue to operate in parallel with the Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme, after the programme becomes operational, for exceptional cases only where there is an unmet clinical need.<\/p><p>Department of Health Website <\/p><p>The Department of Health website contains detailed information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis. It is updated in the event of new developments on the issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Defence","counter":2623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO06300"},{"type":"question","counter":2624,"qnumday":949,"qnumall":"[19636\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO06400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the confusion over the licensing of Civil Defence volunteers by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council to practice as emergency medical technicians or above; if the level of medical care that Civil Defence volunteers are able to provide at the moment is downgraded, if the ambulance service will be able to deal with the increased workload; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2625,"content":"<p>The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) is an independent statutory body with responsibility for professional regulation in the area of  pre-hospital emergency care including the recognition of professional qualifications.  <\/p><p>Accordingly, the Deputy's query has been referred to PHECC for direct response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Services Provision","counter":2626,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO06600"},{"type":"question","counter":2627,"qnumday":950,"qnumall":"[19650\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800087#WROO06700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the HSE is not facilitating the availability and treatment of vitamin C intravenous treatment for recovering cancer patients in the north-west (details supplied); the reason the treatment is not available through general practitioners in the north-west region; the reason it is not licensed or available to pharmacies in the region in view of the success of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2628,"content":"<p>The most appropriate treatment for a patient is a decision to be made by the treating clinician together with his or her patient.

The CervicalCheck programme has agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. In addition, agreement has been reached with the laboratory with the largest backlog to process tests based on a HPV initial testing model; i.e. HPV testing will be carried out on samples prior to cytology. I am advised that this approach was chosen as the most effective way to process all outstanding tests based on prioritising women most at risk.<\/p>  <p>  However, the HSE has advised that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. It has said that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the reduction of turnaround times is a priority.  With the programme now back to normal call-recall procedures, lab turnaround times are improving and more than half of tests are being returned in 9 weeks. However, they can be as long as 33 weeks and this remains a significant challenge. The HSE is continuing to work actively to reduce these turnaround times. In order to do so, it has been undertaking a global search for additional laboratory capacity to support the programme. Additional capacity has now been identified and the HSE is currently working to agree commercial arrangements, and complete quality assurance processes, to enable it to incorporate this capacity into the CervicalCheck programme. Ensuring the programme is fully supported, in the interests of public health, remains my priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800092#WRTT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Counselling Services Provision","counter":2866,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800092#WRTT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2867,"qnumday":1055,"qnumall":"[19958\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800092#WRTT01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in each LHO area waiting for a counselling appointment in primary care at the end of April 2019 or the latest date available;

Brexit has the potential to have a very significant impact on the sector, given its unique exposure to the UK market, which accounted for 38% (&euro;5.2 billion) of agri-food exports last year. <\/p>  <p>  There are on-going discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties which would face Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and the assistance that might be required for its agriculture food and fishery sectors.

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agri-food and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308\/2013) , as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions.

Last November, the Department reached agreement with Libya on a new veterinary health certificate for the export of breeding cattle, and an amended veterinary certificate for the export of fattening and slaughter cattle.  In 2018, 5,500 cattle were exported to Libya, representing approximately 2% of total live exports of cattle for the year.  To date in 2019, 1,900 cattle have been exported to the country, representing approximately 1% of total live exports of cattle for the year to date. <\/p><p>For its part, Ireland continues to work closely with other EU Member State and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) with a view to improving animal welfare practices worldwide. In this regard, Ireland has reaffirmed its on-going commitment to animal welfare through additional OIE multi-annual financial assistance (&euro;75,000 per annum over the period 2017-20) to support its activities to enhance animal welfare worldwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800094#WRVV07800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fallen Animal Collection Scheme","counter":3044,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800095#WRWW00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3045,"qnumday":1127,"qnumall":"[18389\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800095#WRWW00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way in which the 125 km rule and the restriction on the removal of category 1 offal originated; the way in which the 125 km rule came through EU regulation; the way in which the distance of 125 km was chosen; the regulatory references to the implementation of the rule; and his plans to have the 125 km rule reviewed.","asker":"1229","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3046,"content":"<p>The Fallen Animal TSE Subsidy Scheme is an integral part of the infrastructure underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s successful livestock and meat processing industries.  <\/p>  <p>   The Scheme ensures primarily that fallen bovine animals over 48 months, which must be BSE-tested in accordance with EU legislation, are disposed of in compliance with all animal and public health and environmental regulations.

The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) will target the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves - measuring the liveweight of the calf at weaning as a percentage of the cow's liveweight. <\/p>  <p>  This is in addition to supports already available to the sector. According to National Farm Survey data, suckler farmers currently receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  The following outlines the supports for the suckler sector which are currently in place:<\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the past few months have been difficult, most especially beef farmers, following a difficult year in 2018, and with a prolonged and exceptional period of market disturbance low prices since last autumn. Among other factors, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit has had a negative effect.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025. It is crucial that we all continue to work together. I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including the development of Beef Producer Organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the RDP, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.  In that context, there is no capacity to introduce a &euro;200 per cow suckler payment under the current RDP.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.  The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot is a positive step in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800095#WRWW05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":3098,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800095#WRWW05900"},{"type":"question","counter":3099,"qnumday":1149,"qnumall":"[18698\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800095#WRWW06000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider extending the closing deadline for application to the Brexit loan scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3100,"content":"<p>The &euro;300 million \"Brexit Loan Scheme\" was developed in cooperation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to provide working capital support to enable eligible Irish businesses to implement the necessary changes to address the challenges posed by Brexit.

This Resolution is advisory in nature.  Paragraph 53 of this Resolution calls on the European Commission to develop a strategy to ensure a shift from live animal transport to a mainly meat-and-carcass and germinal products trade.  The wider context of the Resolution is a concern for the welfare of animals being transported, a concern I fully share.  I have stressed the importance of ensuring the highest welfare standards of animals in transit in my meetings with live exporters. <\/p>  <p>  My Department maintains robust oversight of the welfare of animals exported from Ireland, through a comprehensive legislative framework.  Irish legislation on sea transport is recognised by the European Commission as being among the most effective and stringent legislation in force on transport by sea.  With regard to road transport, the Department does not approve journey logs from exporters for any live export where the destination country has an orange or red weather alert in place, or where a significant part of the transit route goes through an orange or red alert area. This is in addition to the annual ban on road transport of livestock to Greece, North Africa and Turkey during the months of July and August.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department continues to proactively contribute to efforts to improve animal welfare standards during transport.  My Department is currently providing multiannual funding of &euro;75,000 per year over four years to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) towards the implementation of the second Action Plan of the OIE Platform on Animal Welfare for Europe, in relation to slaughter and transport, within Europe and between Europe and the Middle East and North Africa.   <\/p>  <p>  The European Parliament Resolution notes that in some Member States the live transport of animals, for further production or slaughter, is important to ensure competition in the marketplace.  This is certainly the case in Ireland.  Live exports are a critical part of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry.  They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers.  The Department facilitates this trade, recognising its importance to the agri-sector, while ensuring the highest welfare standards.  In 2018, the combined total value of live animal exports to the Irish economy was &euro;161 million (&euro;110 million for cattle; &euro;49 million for pigs; &euro;2 million for sheep) according to Bord Bia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800096#WRXX03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Appeals","counter":3136,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800096#WRXX03100"},{"type":"question","counter":3137,"qnumday":1162,"qnumall":"[19018\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800096#WRXX03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a payment to a person (details supplied) will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3138,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware from previous recent PQs, a review by the Director of Agriculture Appeals Office of the decision of the Appeals Officer has been requested in this case in accordance with the provisions of the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001. <\/p>  <p>  The Agriculture Appeals Office has indicated that requests for reviews are generally dealt with in order of receipt and that both the Department and the person named will be advised of the outcome when the review has been completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800096#WRXX03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":3139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800096#WRXX03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3140,"qnumday":1163,"qnumall":"[19061\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800096#WRXX03500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to complaints regarding cows loose on public roads in an area (details supplied); and his plans to rectify same.","asker":"1248","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3141,"content":"<p>My Department's inspectors are aware of the matter and have engaged with the individual involved over time, including the issuance of relevant notices.  <\/p><p>Under the Animals Act 1985, it is an offence for a person to permit an animal to stray.

The extension of electronic identification will simplify the sheep tagging system by significantly reducing the record keeping requirements for sheep farmers moving sheep to livestock marts, slaughter plants and export assembly centres and will provide a more accurate and robust sheep traceability system in support of animal health and public health objectives and thus support the further development and sustainability of the sheep industry.<\/p>  <p>  In acknowledgement of the additional costs imposed on farmers in the purchase of electronic tags, I introduced a one-off tag subsidy for farmers, subsidising by &euro;1 the cost of each electronic tag purchased in the first tag order completed between 1st October 2018 and 30 September 2019  (up to a maximum of &euro;100 per farmer). The first tranche of the four payments in this regard was made at end-January in respect of eligible tag orders completed between 1st October and 31 December 2018, where &euro;375,000 was paid to 5,500 farmers while &euro;314,605 was paid to 4,359 farmers earlier this month. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of Central Points of Recording (CPRs) at marts and slaughter plants will make a very significant contribution to increasing the robustness of the National Sheep Identification System.  My officials are working very closely with marts and slaughter plants to ensure that as many of these premises as possible will operate as CPRs with effect from 1st June.  It is my understanding that the major sheep processing slaughter plants are making significant progress in this regard. Marts are similarly well disposed to operating as CPRs and are proactively engaging with the CPR process with a view to having facilities in place at the earliest opportunity.  I accept that the upgrading of mart facilities to CPR standards will be an incremental process and I expect that a significant number of marts will be in a position to operate as CPRs in a relatively short period. <\/p>  <p>  Where it is not feasible for marts to upgrade their facilities to CPR requirements, farmers can continue to move sheep to these premises by either printing out the tag numbers of the sheep to be moved for attachment to the relevant dispatch document or by continuing to record the individual number of each sheep presented to a non-CPR mart on the dispatch document.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of EID to all sheep will further enhance traceability across the sheep sector and will assist in the Government's efforts to maintain and expand the export markets for Irish sheep meat.

A promotional campaign to remind those considering felling or uprooting trees that a tree felling licence may be required before felling takes place;<\/p><p>2.  Tree felling licences are now valid for 10 years and a licence may be granted for a number of operations, e.g. thinning and clear fell, over the course of the validity of the licence, within the one site.<\/p><p>3.  A significant area of the national estate both privately and publicly held, that was planted in the 1980s that is now coming to maturity and requires felling and replanting.<\/p><p>In terms of resources, my Department is constantly keeping this under review in order to try and meet demand. Obviously, the recruitment of new resources has to be done in a way which takes into account overall DAFM needs and competing priorities. In recent times for example, we have recruited two Grade III Archaeologists and trained to assess forestry licence applications. This has led to a significant decrease in the waiting times for approvals which require an archaeological referral. My Department is committed to the preservation of archaeological artefacts found within or near forestry sites.  Archaeology staff liaise with the National Monuments Service and provide a high standard of guidance to their Forestry colleagues, on applications with archaeological concerns.<\/p><p><b><\/b>In relation to the Forestry Appeals Committee, the Forestry Act, 2014, was commenced in 2017 and the independent Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) was established.  Applicants or third parties dissatisfied the any decision on or condition attached to a forestry licence may make an appeal to the FAC within  28 days from the date of decision is provided.<\/p><p>In 2018, 1,082 completed applications for afforestation licences were received and acknowledged. Decisions issued on 861 applications.  A total of 5,969 tree felling licence applications were received in 2018, with 3,603 licences issued. It is important to note that the balance of cases are not necessarily awaiting further work as it is not unusual for completed applications to be received and acknowledged by my Department, but subsequently withdrawn by the applicant.  Further, applications are received on a daily basis, therefore, applications received late in 2018 would be decided in 2019. The timeframes in which forestry licence applications are finalised and decisions issued are under constant review.  In April this year, 95% of afforestation applications, not referred to outside bodies or internally, were issued a decision within 70 days from the date advertised.  Forestry personnel make every effort to ensure that high-quality decisions are made within the timeframes outlined here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800097#WRYY05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Penalties","counter":3237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800097#WRYY05900"},{"type":"question","counter":3238,"qnumday":1197,"qnumall":"[20015\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800097#WRYY06000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a TAMS 2 scheme penalty in the case of a person (details supplied) will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3239,"content":"<p>The person named made an application under the Dairy Equipment Scheme 27 July 2015 and a payment claim was submitted on 16 December 2016.<\/p><p>This application was subject to an on-farm inspection.It is a requirement that payments claimed are verified as part of such an inspection.In this case an issue arose in relation to the receipt for the Milking Machine, resulting in penalties and reductions being applied to the payment in respect of the investments.<\/p><p>A review of this decision was requested and a written reply issued on 15 May 2018 upholding the original decision.

Mobile network operators function in a liberalised market in Ireland, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). The regulation of these service providers, to the extent permitted by law, is a statutory function of ComReg in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act 2002. This role includes the monitoring of compliance by licensed operators with terms and conditions with respect to non-ionising radiation levels. ComReg is statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions.<\/p><p>Irish policy on the public health effects of non-ionising radiation is informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence.

ICNIRP guidelines apply up to a frequency of 300 gigahertz (GHz), well above the maximum frequencies being considered for 5G . ICNIRP guidelines are based on evidence gathered from all peer-reviewed scientific literature and not on the conclusions of any single scientific paper, event, or other source. <\/p><p>In 2015, the Irish Government commissioned a report by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM).

Twenty three members and 1 non-member attended the January 2018 meeting. The April 2018 meeting was again very poorly attended with only 14 of the 44 members in attendance. The average attendance was 40%. Before the revised Forum met, not all of the nominations available were taken up by the angling organisations, nor were the remaining positions open to other sectors taken up despite a thorough appointment process by the Public Appointments Service. <\/p>  <p>  The pattern of low attendance has been an ongoing concern since the original Forum was established in late 2011. There were 9 meetings during the first period of the Forum&rsquo;s operation and the average attendance rate was 39%, with only one of those meetings reaching a quorum. This has too often led to sub-optimal delivery on the Forum&rsquo;s business due to a consistent failure to achieve a quorum to underpin its deliberations. The review of the Forum&rsquo;s operation sought to address this issue but the low attendance pattern persisted following the reconstitution of the Forum in 2017. In that context, the value of meetings has been severely undermined and the effectiveness of the Forum itself, in its current construction, is open to question. <\/p>  <p>  All meetings of the Forum have been independently chaired and Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) attended Forum meetings to provide technical and administrative support to the Chair. IFI has no function in relation to the acceptance or otherwise of inputs which is exclusively a matter for the Chair and the Forum members. I am advised that all views and observations from Forum members have been considered at all meetings under the direction and leadership of the independent Chair who also reported the outcome of Forum meetings directly and impartially to the Board of IFI. <\/p>  <p>  As I have confirmed, there has been a consistently poor attendance level since the Forum was first inaugurated and not a decrease in attendance. Assertions that failure to accept inputs to the Forum contributed to a decrease in attendance are misinformed. They are also not borne out by the recorded attendance records, the established independence of the Chair, the sequence of events around the establishment and review of the Forum or its modus operandi within its terms of reference. In addition, they are not reflected in the discussions I have had with the former independent Chair. <\/p>  <p>  IFI engages with stakeholders at all levels of the organisation from local and regional fisheries staff, project co-ordinators for the National Strategy for Angling Development, researchers and scientific staff up to senior managers. This is indicative of a very high level of engagement with stakeholders. Claims of a lack of consultation appear incompatible with the very poor stakeholder attendance at the statutorily established consultation Forum, the deliberations of which are reported directly to and considered by the Board of IFI.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious, however, that there is a need for productive engagement based on mutually considerate participation to support harmony, cooperation and unity across all the component disciplines within angling. In that regard, I am taking a lead role in relation to high level strategic engagement with angling stakeholders and intend to meet all established angling federations in the coming weeks together with senior officials of my Department and IFI. I have already met with two of the Federations and intend to meet with the others shortly. I am keen to draw together all strands of the representative angling stakeholder base for positive, inclusive and consensual discussions for the benefit of the entire sector acting in a cohesive manner for the good of angling. <\/p>  <p>  This is the level of engagement which I intend to lead. The establishment of a consultative mechanism or Forum is a matter for IFI under section 7 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010. My role under the Act relates to the appointment of the independent Chair and it would not be appropriate for me to chair the Forum. While that process is under consideration, the appointment of a new Chair will not address the fundamental operational challenges caused by an absence of adequate stakeholder attendance and there is, therefore, merit in re-examining in parallel the construction and functioning of the Forum. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, the profile and potential timetable for a review of the Forum can be discussed, and an effort made to establish a concentrated and focussed consultative mechanism to which I would expect stakeholders to give a constructive and supportive commitment and full and regular participation for the benefit of the entire sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800098#WRZZ07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":3327,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800099#WRAAA00400"},{"type":"question","counter":3328,"qnumday":1229,"qnumall":"[18821\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800099#WRAAA00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if an organisation (details supplied) can avail of a class 35 planning exemption.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":3329,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to Class 35 exemptions under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (Statutory Instrument 600 of 2001).

The RESS will deliver a broader range of policy objectives including: the provision of pathways and supports for communities to participate in renewable energy projects and broadening the renewable electricity technology mix.  The RESS will provide opportunities for cost effective solar energy projects, at scale, to participate in the diversification of our renewable portfolio. <\/p>  <p>  The design of the new scheme has been shaped by the 2014-2020 EU State Aid Guidelines, which promote a move away from guaranteed fixed prices for renewable generators (as per existing REFIT feed in tariffs) to a more market oriented mechanism (renewable auctions) where the cost of support will be determined primarily by competitive bidding between renewable generators.

The regulation of these service providers, to the extent permitted by law, is a statutory function of ComReg in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act 2002.

ComReg is statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions.<\/p><p>Irish policy on the public health effects of non-ionising radiation is informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence.

It examined and synthesised existing peer-reviewed research into clear findings, with particular focus on the potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields arising from high voltage power lines, and electromagnetic fields from base stations for mobile communication.

Over 1,000 homes at risk of energy poverty have been upgraded to date under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The following schemes are also open to low income households, and offer a very high level of grant support on the cost of a whole house upgrade.<\/p>  <p>-   The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme which was launched in 2017 also offers grant support of up to 95% to homeowners in energy poverty.  To date, a total of 214 homes have been upgraded under this scheme, including 82 homes at risk of energy poverty. <\/p>  <p>-   The Better Energy Communities Scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area &ndash; homes, including those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses.  Funding of 80% is available to privately owned homes in energy poverty.  In 2018, 809 homes at risk of energy poverty received upgrades under this Scheme.  This represents approximately, 75% of all homes upgraded under this Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The sustained level of interest and delivery seen in recent years is a strong indicator that eligible households are being reached and benefitting from the schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800100#WRBBB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3419,"content":"<p>Question No. 1262 answered with Question No. 1241.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":3420,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800100#WRBBB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":3421,"qnumday":1263,"qnumall":"[20082\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800100#WRBBB03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of broadband in an area (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":3422,"content":"<p>The premises referred to by the Deputy is in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at .

Motorways of the Sea is considered a horizontal priority of CEF and constitutes the maritime pillar of CEF. It is a separate and smaller funding stream under the overall CEF allocation, and it aims to promote green, viable, attractive and efficient sea-based transport links which are integrated into the entire transport chain. <\/p><p>To date, there have been fifty projects funded under the Motorways of the Sea funding priority overall. Over half of these have been for actions that can be categorised as environmental, with the remainder in the areas of logistics and integration and traffic management. Projects funded under the Motorways of the Sea funding priority must involve at least two Member States and at least one core TEN-T port. Details of all fifty projects, including beneficiaries and the amount of CEF funding awarded per project, are available on the website of the European Commission at the following link:<\/p><p>There have been two successful applications for Motorways of the Sea funding involving Irish beneficiaries. Separately, Ireland's three core TEN-T ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes have all been successful in applying for and obtaining significant CEF funding under broader maritime funding objectives.<\/p><p>The most recent Motorways of the Sea detailed implementation plan was published in April 2018 by the former European Coordinator for Motorways of the Sea, Mr Brian Simpson. Professor Kurt Bodewig assumed the role of European Coordinator for Motorways of the Sea in September 2018 and plans to publish a new detailed implementation plan in late 2019.<\/p><p>On 16 and 17 April 2019, a Motorways of the Sea seminar on the topic of Ireland's European Connectivity took place in Dublin. This seminar was organised by the TEN-T European Coordinators for Motorways of the Sea, the North Sea - Mediterranean Core Network Corridor, and the Atlantic Core Network Corridor. Present at this seminar were many of the key representatives in the port, shipping, freight and logistics sectors, from Ireland and other Member States with Atlantic coastlines, as well as officials from DG MOVE and the European Commission's Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA). <\/p><p>I met with the three TEN-T European Coordinators during their visit to Ireland to discuss the future of Motorways of the Sea in the context of the new Connecting Europe Facility Regulation for the period 2021 - 2027. During this meeting, I communicated to the Coordinators the potential that Brexit has to fracture the level of connectivity that currently exists for Irish traders. I emphasised that the capacity of our ports and our shipping links are vital to the success of the national economy, particularly as an island nation on the periphery of Europe. I stressed that EU funding opportunities and assistance through CEF and Motorways of the Sea would be welcome in order to encourage practical solutions to Ireland's current challenges.<\/p><p>Finally, with regard to the UK landbridge, the Government&rsquo;s preparedness and contingency planning for Brexit has from the outset and as a priority included issues relating to its continued effective use, given its importance for Irish exporters and importers as a means of access to the rest of the single market, in particular with regard to agri-food products. This is an important issue with regard to protecting the competitiveness of our producers and ensuring continued unhampered access to the EU Single Market.<\/p><p>Retaining the effective use of the landbridge post-Brexit has been discussed at both political and official level with the UK and the EU. As a result of these contacts, the importance of maintaining the landbridge has been recognised through the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement. This reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate the efficient and timely transit through the UK of goods moving from Ireland to another EU Member State or another country, or vice versa.<\/p><p>To this end, I welcome the EU's agreement that the UK will join the Common Transit Convention upon its departure from the EU, and that the formal process required for this to happen has concluded. The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Travel Convention will play an important role in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s access to other EU Member States via the UK landbridge. Work has been on-going in partnership the European Commission and affected Member States with regard to the Union's internal transit procedures and infrastructural solutions at EU ports to facilitate transit post-Brexit and is progressing well, though the risk of delays in a no deal Brexit scenario remains a concern notably on the Dover-Calais route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800101#WRCCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taxi Regulations","counter":3469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800101#WRCCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":3470,"qnumday":1279,"qnumall":"[18729\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800101#WRCCC00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the advertising or public information available to make persons using taxis aware of an application (details supplied).","asker":"1367","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3471,"content":"<p>The regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry, including the 'Driver Check' app, is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the <i>Taxi Regulation Act 2013<\/i>. <\/p><p>Given the role of the NTA as regulator, I have referred your question to the Authority for direct reply to you.

In light of this consultation there are currently no plans to change the criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  I would particularly emphasise to the Deputy that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would in fact put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800102#WRDDD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":3554,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800102#WRDDD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":3555,"qnumday":1309,"qnumall":"[19490\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800102#WRDDD02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if funding is available to sports clubs seeking to install a defibrillator; the value of such funds; and the amount drawn down in each of the years 2016 to 2018 for same.","asker":"1228","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":3556,"qnumday":1310,"qnumall":"[19491\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800102#WRDDD02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if sports and recreation clubs seeking to install defibrillators within their facilities must pay VAT on these devices; and if there is funding available to offset this expense.","asker":"1228","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":3557,"qnumday":1311,"qnumall":"[19492\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800102#WRDDD02300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if funding is available to assist sports and recreation clubs that have fitted or are fitting defibrillator devices within their premises with the provision of training of volunteers in the use of the devices.","asker":"1228","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3558,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1309 to 1311, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Sports Capital Programme (SCP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.

From now on, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will require a specific site risk assessment to be carried out if such works are being considered during the nesting season;  this will enable the company to assess whether the works can be delayed until after the nesting season, and to consider whether less intrusive mitigation works might be carried out in the short term to keep the railway safe until after the bird-nesting season.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800103#WREEE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3602,"content":"<p>Question No. 1331 answered with Question No. 1325.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":3603,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800103#WREEE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":3604,"qnumday":1332,"qnumall":"[20043\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800103#WREEE01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to introduce legislation or regulations to make it mandatory for motorists to have headlights on at all times while driving; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1333","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3605,"content":"<p>The mandatory use of Daytime Running Lights (DRL) is already in effect for all new cars type-approved within the EU since 7th February 2011.\u00a0 DRL is a lighting system that automatically switches on when a vehicle is started and emits white light to the front of the vehicle in order to increase the visibility of the vehicle on the road during daytime.\u00a0 DLR requirements were introduced via European Directive 2008\/89\/EC (updating Council Directive 76\/756\/EEC).\u00a0 My Department has no plans at present to make the daytime use of headlights mandatory for any vehicles other than those already featured in EU legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800103#WREEE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme","counter":3606,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800103#WREEE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":3607,"qnumday":1333,"qnumall":"[20048\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800103#WREEE01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when he plans to announce the allocation of grants under the sports capital programme in respect of the applications already submitted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3608,"content":"<p>The 2018 round of the Sports Capital Programme closed for applications on Friday 19th October last.

It will be introduced this October, with payments flowing from November.<\/p>  <p>  Through the NCS and a range of other measures, I am committed to changing Ireland&rsquo;s childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world to one of the very best. When the Scheme is introduced, many families will become eligible for early learning and care and school age childcare subsidies for the first time and many more families will qualify for increased levels of subsidy.  The Scheme also provides a vital platform for future investment in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to radically improve access to quality childcare, improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Targeted subsidies will be available for families with NET annual incomes up to &euro;60,000 whose children are between 6 months and 15 years old and who are availing of registered childcare. A net income of &euro;60,000 could mean a gross household income of up to &euro;100,000 per annum and hence the NCS will capture families that might be considered middle income earners. This maximum net income threshold was significantly increased in Budget 2019 from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000 per annum, meaning that an estimated 7,500 more children will benefit from the scheme relative to the original proposals.  Over 40,000 other children, already eligible for the scheme, will see increases to their subsidies. This is a significant positive change which will benefit middle-income families.<\/p>  <p>  Parents who do not qualify for an income-related subsidy under the National Childcare Scheme may qualify for a universal subsidy instead. The universal subsidy is available to all families with children under three years, and to families with children over three years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme. This subsidy provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week and equates to &euro;1040 per annum for a child utilising full time registered early learning and care. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the new Scheme has been designed flexibly with income thresholds and subsidy rates which can be adjusted incrementally over time as Government investment becomes available.<\/p>  <p>  In September and October, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will run a large information campaign across a number of media channels to ensure there is full awareness amongst parents of their potential entitlements under the new Scheme. This campaign will advise parents how they can avail of the Scheme and the levels of subsidy to which they may be entitled.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I have recently expanded the ECCE pre-school programme. When introduced in 2010, ECCE provided one academic year of pre-school free of charge to children. This has now been extended to two years. Estimates suggest that working parents availing of the full two years may save &euro;5,700 approximately on their early learning and care costs.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, First 5, the recently published Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families commits to doubling investment in early learning and care and school age childcare over the next 10 years.

ECCE is only available through participating early years services, a list of these services is available through the relevant local CCC<\/p><p><b><i>Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme is a childcare programme targeted to support parents\/guardians on a low income to avail of reduced childcare costs at participating community childcare services. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) pays for a portion of the childcare costs for eligible children, with the parent\/guardian paying the remainder. The CCS is only available through participating community not-for-profit childcare services, a list of these services is available through the relevant local County Childcare Committee. CCS subvention is available for 52 weeks of the year. The CCS programme commenced on 20th August 2018 and runs until 16th August 2019. This is referred to as the Programme year. CCS services may cater for infant, pre-school and afterschool places. They may also incorporate a breakfast club. Some CCS services may be stand-alone services and cater for just one type of service e.g. afterschool.<\/p><p>Please note CCS will be discontinued at the end of the 2018\/2019 programme year.<\/p><p><b><i>Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP)<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCS Plus) Programme provides support for parents\/guardians on a low income to avail of reduced childcare costs at participating privately owned childcare services and at community not-for-profit childcare services; a list of these services is available through the relevant local County Childcare Committee.  The DCYA pays a portion of the childcare costs for eligible children, with the parent\/guardian paying the remainder. The eligibility of the parent\/guardian is determined by their status with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection . The CCS Plus programme commenced on 20th August 2018 and runs until 16th August 2019. This is referred to as the Programme year. CCS Plus services may cater for infant, pre-school and afterschool places. They may also incorporate a breakfast club. Some CCS Plus services may be stand-alone services and cater for just one type of service e.g. afterschool. <\/p><p><b><i>Universal Subsidy (CCSU) <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>As part of the Government policy to make childcare more affordable,  DCYA introduced in 2017 a universal childcare subvention payment of up to &euro;20 per week for families using eligible childcare providers for the care of children aged from 6 months to the first eligible point of entry to the ECCE scheme. This scheme is administered via an enhancement to the CCS Plus scheme.<\/p><p><b><i>Community Childcare Subvention Resettlement (CCSR) <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>As per government policy, the Government of Ireland increased Ireland&rsquo;s resettlement quota to cater for up to 4,000 Programme Refugees. To support the Programme Refugees (PRs) in their resettlement and integration into Irish society, the need to provide dedicated childcare funding was recognised. Childcare funding for this cohort was incorporated into the existing CCSP Programme to enable parents\/guardians to be free to attend a language and orientation course for up to 60 weeks <\/p><p><b><i>Community Childcare Subvention Resettlement (Transitional) (CCSR(T)) <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>As part of the &ldquo;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rdquo;, DCYA launched a special provision under the current Community Childcare Subvention Programme, entitled CCSR (Transitional), which provides access to free childcare for children of families experiencing homelessness. The provision provides subvention for all pre-school children aged 0 to 5 inclusive and 6 to 12 year olds during the school holidays only. The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation. CCSRT is available through all services participating in the CCS\/P programmes.<\/p><p><b><i>Training and Employment Childcare (TEC)<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The TEC Programme is an overarching childcare programme funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and is specifically designed to support parents\/guardians on eligible Education and Training Board training courses, as well as certain categories of parents\/guardians returning to work by providing subsidised childcare places. The TEC Programme provides childcare support for parents\/guardians on certain education and training courses (CETS), parents\/guardians working on Community Employment programmes (CEC), and also for families on Family Income Support (ASCC): <\/p><p><b><i>Childcare Education and Training Support programme (CETS) <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The CETS Programme is administered and funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

ASCC is available for a once off maximum of 52 weeks and this allowance does not have to be used consecutively. <\/p><p>Extra funding is provided to compensate for school holidays. <\/p><p><b><i>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS)<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), the pathway to quality, accessible, affordable Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare was launched on the 11th of March 2019.<\/p><p>It is the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for childcare. Through this entitlement, the NCS aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, reduce child poverty and tangibly reduce the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland.<\/p><p>The NCS will support families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years who are attending any participating Tusla registered childcare service, including any Tusla registered childminder. A full list of contracted childcare providers will be available on www.ncs.gov.ie in the autumn of 2019.<\/p><p>There are two types of supports available under the Scheme: a Universal subsidy and an Income Assessed subsidy.<\/p><p>The Universal subsidy is available to all families with children under three years. It is also available to families with children over three years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme. The Universal subsidy provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week. It is not means tested and can typically be calculated within minutes of applying via the Scheme&rsquo;s online system.<\/p><p>An Income Assessed subsidy is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and will be calculated based on your individual circumstances. The subsidy rate will vary depending on your level of family income, your child&rsquo;s age and their educational stage. It can be used towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week where parents are working, studying or training, or in circumstances where a parent is unavailable to care for a child. Where parents are not working, studying or training, the subsidy will be paid for up to a maximum of 15 hours per week.<\/p><p>When operational, the parent will be able to apply for a subsidy online or by post.  <\/p><p>A parent is required to have a verified MyGovID when making an online application. A verified MyGovID is a single, secure account to unlock Irish Government services online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800104#WRFFF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":3680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800104#WRFFF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":3681,"qnumday":1358,"qnumall":"[19437\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800104#WRFFF02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if persons employed by the early childhood care and education programme will continue to be described as providing early years education; and if there are proposed changes to this title.","asker":"1223","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":3682,"qnumday":1359,"qnumall":"[19438\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800104#WRFFF02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she is considering changes to the title of the early childhood care and education programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3683,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1358 and 1359 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Children of Youth Affairs provides funding for the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare sector through a wide range of schemes and initiatives.   <\/p>  <p>  The largest annual funding stream is for the universal pre-school programme, or Early Childhood Care and Education programme.  This programme resources Early Learning and Care services to provide children with 15 hours per week of pre-school education over a 38-week programme year, for two years, free of charge to parents.  <\/p>  <p>  In practice, parents, providers and the wider public use a number of different names and titles to describe this programme and the staff who work there.  For example, the programme itself is called:- the free preschool programme, the free pre-school year\/s, the ECCE programme, sessional pre-school and free childcare hours, among others. In respect of the staff who deliver this programme, similarly there is a range of terms used to describe their job titles and roles, as there is for those who work in the wider Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare sector.  Staff are sometimes referred to as early years educators, but very often, other titles are used.  <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of a professional regulator or professional body for the sector, no titles have been agreed at national level to date.  Staff are employed by individual providers, either private or community not for profit, and sometimes the provider proposes terminology to be used to describe the various roles within the service. <\/p>  <p>  However, my Department acknowledges the centrality of the workforce to delivering quality Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare services and to that end has made a number of commitments in First 5, the recently published Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, in respect of the workforce.  Most significantly, the Strategy commits to a Workforce Development Plan to ensure the appropriate number of staff at all levels in the sector and support the achievement of ambitious qualification targets. The Workforce Development Plan will also consider the grading structure for the sector and seek to agree terminology. It will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare sector, establish a career framework and leadership development opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference  for the Workforce Development Plan Steering Group have recently been published. Critical to its work will be the input of a Stakeholder Advisory Group, and a public consultation will also take place which will include consultation on the language we use to describe different occupational roles within the sector. The first phase of the Plan, including the main report, is to be completed by the summer of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800104#WRFFF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Births","counter":3684,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800104#WRFFF02500"},{"type":"question","counter":3685,"qnumday":1360,"qnumall":"[19526\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800104#WRFFF02600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will consider a scoping exercise into a legal birth registration to be expanded beyond those cases which are already held by Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3686,"content":"<p>There is currently no legal basis for the State to gain access to records held by private bodies or individuals.

This impacts on the quality of ELC provision through its effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care together with high staff turnover impact directly on the quality of service children receive, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill the workforce. My support for improved pay and conditions for ELC practitioners has been explicit given their critical role in supporting children&rsquo;s development and supporting families.<\/p>  <p>  An objective of mine is to continue to increase investment in the ELC sector.  Over the last 4 budgets we have achieved an increase of 117% and First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, published in November, commits to doubling that again over the next 10 years. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p>  <p>  I have actively encouraged the sector to seek a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO).  As the State is not the employer of ELC staff, it is therefore unable to set wage levels.  A SEO has been proposed as a way forward for the ELC sector, but it must be initiated by a grouping representing the sector. Organisations requesting the commencement of such a process must show they have significant membership, but the relevant Trade Unions have not yet reached the thresholds required. A Sectoral Employment Order would provide for mandatory terms and conditions in the early learning and care and school age childcare sector, minimum rates of remuneration, and other conditions.<\/p>  <p>Separate to a Sectoral Employment Order, First 5   includes a commitment to review the funding model for the ELC sector, under which employers would be supported to provide more favourable working conditions to attract and retain staff. The new funding model would complement a Sectoral Employment Order and existing Government funded early learning and care schemes by leveraging additional investment for certain criteria, for example, employers introducing better pay would receive greater investment.  It is envisaged that this new funding model would open up alternative mechanisms by which the State could incentivise services to meet national standards in relation to wages and\/or working conditions.<\/p>  <p>In addition, work will commence shortly on the development of a Workforce Development Plan, which will identify practical steps to achieve First 5   commitments relating to the workforce.  The Workforce Development Plan will also set out plans to raise the profile of careers in ELC and SAC, establish a career framework and leadership development opportunities and will work towards building a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.<\/p>  <p>  I also aim to achieve a graduate-led ELC workforce with at least 50% of staff working directly with children holding an appropriate degree-level qualification by 2028. A medium-term goal on the way to achieving this percentage is to increase the percentage of graduates working in the sector from 22% today to 30% within three years.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the profile of careers in ELC and SAC is of high importance to me and I intend to establish a career framework with developmental opportunities. The Workforce Development Plan demonstrates the commitment of my Department to ensuring that ELC and SAC professionals have clear pathways for entry and progression in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Other interventions my Department has led on to improve conditions in the sector include:<\/p>  <p>  - The development of paid CPD (continuous professional development).<\/p>  <p>  - Development of multi-award winning training opportunities (LINC).<\/p>  <p>  - A 7% increase in ECCE capitation last year.<\/p>  <p>  - The provision of &euro;19.4m annually in Programme Support Payments to acknowledge the administrative demands of operating government schemes. <\/p>  <p>  - Enhanced career options for graduate staff which include Inspector positions in Tusla and the DCYA funded Early Years Department of Education Inspectorate, 130 graduates are now employed to support quality and inclusion development within Better Start, Pobal.<\/p>  <p>  - Additional investment in higher capitation paid to ECCE services which employ graduates.

In line with the Department&rsquo;s strategic objective of ensuring high standards of compliance on governance and accountability, a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Youth Funding programmes was conducted in 2013. The review examined three of the targeted funding schemes: Special Projects for Youth (SPY); Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund 1 and 2 (YPFSF) and Local Drugs Task Force projects (LDTF). <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the review found that youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding. However, the review also found that the programmes and performance related governance arrangements require significant reform. The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure an evidence-based and outcomes focused programme designed to secure optimal outcomes for young people. Government Decision S 180\/20\/1 0\/0993C provided for publication of a Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Funding Programmes (2014) (VFMPR) and implementation of the recommendations therein. <\/p>  <p>  The overall purpose of reform of the youth funding programmes is to provide effective support to vulnerable young people in non-formal education settings.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been actively engaged in a range of measures to support implementation of the VFMPR since its publication.  <\/p>  <p>  Implementation measures to date include: (a) mapping of youth service provision; (b) an evidence review of schemes of a similar nature (both nationally and internationally); (c) introduction of a Sample Service Funding Scheme for new services which were required to meet criteria based on the recommendations of the VFMPR; (d) streamlining the of administration of youth funding via Education and Training Boards (ETBs); (e) development of an Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement Tool; (f) development of Pilot Performance and Oversight Framework for use in the sample process and (f) introduction of a Service Level Agreement between my Department and each ETB and between the ETBs and the funded projects. <\/p>  <p>   Implementation of the Review has been guided by a multi-sectoral Lead Team, with specific attention to matters related to measurement through a Measurement Advisory Group. A central recommendation of the review was that the Department should replace the existing funding programmes with a single fit-for-purpose youth scheme to target disadvantaged young people with evidence informed interventions and services that will secure good outcomes. Design of a single targeted youth funding scheme (TYFS) has been the primary focus for the Lead Team.

With effect from 1 January 2019 the current rate of the National Minimum Wage is &euro;9.80 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent figures published by Eurostat (January 2019) show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,656.2 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;2,071 per month (for comparison purposes Eurostat converts countries&rsquo; hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates). \u00a0Allowing for purchasing power standards, Ireland drops to sixth place, but still remains in the group with the highest minimum wage rates in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated. \u00a0The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare. \u00a0As a voluntary initiative, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlement. \u00a0The National Minimum Wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees, and a statutory obligation on employers.<\/p>  <p>  The setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and Government does not interfere unduly in the process.\u00a0 More broadly, this area also comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through her Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for industrial relations issues generally and wage-setting mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) and Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800105#WRGGG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Partial Capacity Benefit Scheme","counter":3772,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800105#WRGGG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":3773,"qnumday":1391,"qnumall":"[20085\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800105#WRGGG04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to address perceived discriminatory measures (details supplied) under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":3774,"qnumday":1505,"qnumall":"[20084\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800105#WRGGG04600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to remove the barriers associated with the partial capacity benefit scheme and allow persons on invalidity pensions to participate in employment for rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes for up to 20 hours per week as permitted under pre-2013 exemption arrangements without the need to transfer to partial capacity benefit in view of ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the recent changes to the rules on disability allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3775,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1391 and 1505 together.<\/p><p>Invalidity Pension (IP) is a pension paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness.

The Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) scheme seeks to address this objective, an objective which is underpinned by evidence that remaining in the workforce, at some level, also encourages social integration and raises living standards.\u00a0 Given this, where a person in receipt of IP wishes to return to work they may apply for Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB).<\/p><p>Since 13 February 2012, Partial Capacity Benefit replaced the previous exemption arrangements where people on Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension could get permission to work part-time (known as an exemption) for rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes and keep their full social welfare payment.<\/p><p>It is important to note however, in relation to PCB that:<\/p><p>- participation\u00a0 is voluntary<\/p><p>- there is no requirement that a person must undertake work that is of a &lsquo;rehabilitative or therapeutic&rsquo; nature (no exemption needs to be sought from DEASP)<\/p><p>- there is no restriction on the number of hours worked<\/p><p>- there is no restriction on earnings<\/p><p>- a person who participates on the PCB scheme may return to an Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment if, for example, the employment ceases or if the person cannot continue to work<\/p><p>- a person on PCB, with an underlying entitlement to IP, will retain their Free Travel Pass for a period of five years.<\/p><p>- PCB allows people to continue to receive a percentage of their Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment while working. The personal rate of payment of PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction, regarding their capacity for work, whether the person was in receipt of Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension and their current rate of payment.\u00a0 After the medical assessment, if a person's disability is rated as moderate, severe or profound their previous payment continues at 50%, 75% or 100% per cent, respectively.<\/p><p>Given the above, it is not intended to change the Invalidity Pension payment to remove the income support available through the Partial Capacity Benefit where persons wish to enter or return to employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800105#WRGGG04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory)","counter":3776,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800105#WRGGG04800"},{"type":"question","counter":3777,"qnumday":1392,"qnumall":"[18400\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800105#WRGGG04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will introduce a change to the calculation for the State pension (contributory) for those that are unable to avail of the homecaring periods scheme or the homemaker's scheme (details supplied);

A person may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions.  This and other care-related supports, such as the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant, provide recognition and support for the valuable role of carers.<\/p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks for each person being cared for.  It can be taken in one block or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks.  The current weekly rate is &euro;220.00.  Where a person is caring for two or more care recipients, the rate of payment is increased by 50%.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of March 2019, there were 2,815 carers in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.  An Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) was being made in respect of 817 children, 367 of whom are aged 12 years or more.  Expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in 2018 was &euro;35.93m.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the cost of extending the number of weeks Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is paid from 104 to 156 weeks due to the unpredictability of the variables underlying this payment.  This is primarily due to not being able to forecast the extent of the possible duration of payment for existing recipients and also because of the potential for an increase in the number of claims if the payment is available for an extended period.  Some recipients have recently started receiving payment, others are reaching the end of the max payment period and others are only in receipt of the payment for a short period of time e.g. in the case of a terminal illness.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that not all those claiming Carer&rsquo;s Benefit opt to remain in payment for the full 104 weeks.  My Department examined this matter in 2017 and found that the average duration on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit was 74.2 weeks between 2010 and 2016.  Therefore, the current 104 week payment duration represents a reasonable length of time to support a carer&rsquo;s temporary absence from work.  Where care is provided beyond the period of entitlement to Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, the means tested Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is available for those who are in need of income support.  These arrangements ensure an efficient use of public funds while assisting those who are in most need of an income support.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the right to carer's leave from employment complements the Carer's Benefit Scheme. The Carer's Leave Act 2001 allows employees to leave their employment temporarily to provide full-time care for someone in need of full-time care and attention.  A person is entitled to take carer&rsquo;s leave of at least 13 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.  Carer's leave from employment is unpaid but the Carer&rsquo;s Leave Act ensures that people who want to take carer's leave will have their jobs kept open for them while they are on carer's leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800106#WRHHH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Data","counter":3822,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800106#WRHHH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":3823,"qnumday":1407,"qnumall":"[18689\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800106#WRHHH01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when she signed into law section 11 of the Water Services Act 2014; the data collected prior to the signing of this legislation into law; the reason this data was collected; the length of time personal data was collected by her Department; the reason it took her four years to sign section 11 of the Act into law; if Irish Water still has this information; and if not, if it has been expunged.","asker":"1235","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3824,"content":"<p>In July 2013, Irish Water was incorporated as a semi-state company under the Water Services Act 2013.

The 2017 SILC data indicate that there were 105,000 children in consistent poverty in 2017, a decrease of 25,000 children on 2016.  This means that a revised figure of 68,000 children have to be lifted out of consistent poverty to meet the target by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recently available poverty data is based on income and living conditions data from 2017.  The full benefit of the growing economy and the increases introduced in Budgets 2018 and 2019 have yet to be seen.  Budget 2019, in line with budgets over the past 3 years, included measures specifically aimed at supporting families on low incomes through increases in qualified child rates (including the introduction of a higher rate for children over 12 years of age), increases in earnings disregards for One Parent Family and Jobseeker Transition payments, the introduction of a maintenance payment disregard for the Working Family Payment, an increase in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the introduction of a hot meals pilot in the School Meals programme.<\/p>  <p>  These increased supports along with increasing employment rates suggest that we can expect further decreases in the poverty rates once the 2018 figures become available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800106#WRHHH04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Legislation","counter":3846,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800106#WRHHH04100"},{"type":"question","counter":3847,"qnumday":1415,"qnumall":"[18877\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800106#WRHHH04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on the fact that the European Commission has now launched infringement proceedings against Ireland for failure to transpose the IORP II Directive; and the reason the transposition of same has been delayed to the point that Ireland now faces infringement proceedings.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3848,"content":"<p>The transposition of the IORP II Directive will result in significant improvements to the regulation and governance of funded occupational pension schemes in Ireland.

When the employee is over 12 months in the job, the Employee Retention Grant Scheme (ERGS) can be applied for and not WSS.<\/p>  <p>  The ERGS is a grant available to private sector employers should an employee acquire a disability whilst in employment, as in this case. \u00a0The grant aims to assist employers in retaining such employees. \u00a0The cause or nature of the illness, condition or impairment is not relevant for the purpose of this grant. \u00a0The ERGS will enable employers to identify the continuing potential of such staff to be productive and valuable employees. \u00a0It will assist in enabling the retention of the employee in their current position or in retraining the employee for another position in the company for the benefit of both the employer and the employee. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The employer in this instance should contact their local INTREO centre for advice and assistance regarding the ERGS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800107#WRJJJ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":3917,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800107#WRJJJ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":3918,"qnumday":1439,"qnumall":"[19301\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800107#WRJJJ03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a review for disability allowance will be expedited in the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3919,"content":"<p>Based on the evidence supplied in support of this person&rsquo;s application, her application for disability allowance (DA) was disallowed on the grounds that the medical qualifying condition was not satisfied.

set out in the Action Plan for Jobs have created an environment in which business can succeed and has led to the creation of almost 400,000 jobs in Ireland \u00a0since the economic low point of 2012. \u00a0Secondly, through\u00a0the \u00a0Pathways To Work strategy, my\u00a0Department ensures that as many new jobs as possible are filled by people taken from the live register, particularly the long-term unemployed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing youth unemployment.\u00a0 Latest available data from the CSO shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 12.8% in April 2019 and now lies below the EU average of 14.9%.\u00a0 Additionally, the number of young people in employment has increased by 25% since 2012 , with 247,500 young people in work by the fourth quarter of 2018. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.\u00a0 There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a personal progression plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0For those who do not find employment through this process, additional offers are provided for through further education and training programmes or in existing community-based employment programmes\/workplace based interventions such as Community Employment\u00a0and T&uacute;s; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.

DOs are appointed under the Social Welfare legislation to decide almost every question in relation to social insurance and social assistance provisions in the Social Welfare Acts.<\/p><p>Every claimant is entitled to have their claim considered in accordance with the principles of natural and constitutional justice and in the context of determinations of entitlement under the social welfare legislation that includes:<\/p><p>1. The right to know the information, upon which a decision is being made,2. The opportunity to comment upon any reports or documents being used in reaching the decision and to present his or her case,3. The right to know the reasons for any adverse decision, 4. The right to have all relevant evidence considered and irrelevant evidence not taken into account, 5. To have the decision made by an impartial person whose discretion has not been fettered and6. Where it is necessary for a fair determination of the issues, an oral hearing. <\/p><p>Over the years, the Courts have laid down rules for administrative bodies to ensure that persons seeking benefits etc. are dealt with in a scrupulously fair manner. These rules, which are known as the Rules of Natural Justice (NJ), apply to all administrative bodies and tribunals. Where a person may be adversely affected by a decision, the claimant must be given the opportunity to refute or comment on any evidence or allegations used in making such a determination.<\/p><p>A DO is required to make an independent judgement on the application of the law, and is not subject to directions when making a decision.  A DO must determine the question before him\/her and there should not be even an appearance of the case having been decided on the basis of another person's say-so.<\/p><p>In the case of a decision to suspend, disallow, disqualify or reduce payment, all reasonable efforts should be made to contact the claimant <i>before<\/i>payment is suspended and the customer given an opportunity to state his or her case. Suspension should not be imposed unless there is reasonable belief that the basic conditions are not being fulfilled.<\/p><p>The decision must be conveyed to the person concerned. <\/p><p>In general when a person makes a claim for benefit or assistance the burden of proof is upon that person to prove the conditions governing the claim are satisfied. <\/p><p>Where the claimant has been awarded benefit and a question arises of withdrawing it or of reducing the amount of payment, the burden is on the Department to show that his\/her entitlement has changed, or that there was fraudulent concealment of relevant facts.

The retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the fire fighter role. The retirement age for retained fire fighters is 55, with provision for an annual extension up to 58 years of age, subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment.<\/p>  <p>  International research indicates that a retirement age of 55 is the optimum age to ensure that fire fighters are capable of satisfactorily performing the tasks expected of them.  The retirement age of 55 was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job. Since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and underpinned by subsequent legislation, every fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.<\/p>  <p>  A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the relevant trade unions in November 2002.  The collective agreement provided, inter alia, for the appointment of an Expert Group which would advise on the retirement age for retained fire fighters.  The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained fire fighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age.  A circular was subsequently issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained fire-fighters in line with the Expert Report.<\/p>  <p>  In general any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established industrial relations processes. In this regard, the matter of increasing the age of retirement of fire fighters was included as part of recent preliminary discussions on a wide range of issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, between the Local Government Management Agency (representing the employers) and SIPTU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800110#WRMMM03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water","counter":4115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800110#WRMMM03100"},{"type":"question","counter":4116,"qnumday":1512,"qnumall":"[19362\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800110#WRMMM03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he approved the significant increases in the cost of domestic connections which came into effect on 1 April 2019.","asker":"1250","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4117,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Part V homes are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been completed and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  Following consideration of a number of implementation issues arising, I expect to be in a position to publish the Review very shortly.

Soon after polling day has been determined my Department places an advertisement in national newspapers, reminding voters with disabilities about their entitlement to be included in the supplement to the postal and special voters lists, as appropriate to their circumstances, if they are not already included in the postal and special voters lists. Later on, a further advertisement is placed reminding voters who have difficulty gaining access to their local polling station that they may apply to have their vote transferred to a more accessible station in their constituency\/local electoral area. <\/p>  <p>  In my Department&rsquo;s Memorandum for the Guidance of Returning Officers, which issues in advance of electoral events, advice is provided about the selection of polling stations having regard to the needs of voters with disabilities. Where it has not been possible to acquire premises for polling stations that are or can be made accessible to wheelchair users, Returning Officers must give public notice of these premises as soon as they are selected as polling stations. They are advised to do so as soon as possible but, as a minimum, they are required to do so no later than 8 days before polling day so as to give electors adequate time to apply to have their vote transferred to an alternative accessible polling place if they so wish. The Guidance advises Returning Officers that the form of public notice could include advertising in national and local newspapers, use of appropriate websites, use of local media and communicating with local disability groups as well as other relevant local and national groups.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Memorandum for the Guidance of Returning Officers also addresses the need for awareness regarding the needs of voters with disabilities. Returning Officers are required to provide at each polling station an appropriate table and chair, located in such a position as to ensure secrecy in voting, at which electors such as wheelchair users, persons with a physical disability, persons with vision impairment or the elderly can mark their ballot papers if they find it more convenient. Where feasible, they are asked to consider installing a low height voting compartment to facilitate voters who use wheelchairs or those who are short of stature. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Manual for Presiding Officers, which also issues to Returning Officers in advance of electoral events for use in their polling stations, draws particular attention to the needs of voters with disabilities. The Manual sets out a number of practical measures in this regard and refers to an online training module that is available on the website of the National Disability Authority.   More generally, the Electoral Acts contain measures to assist voters with particular disabilities. Voters who are blind or vision impaired or who are otherwise so physically incapacitated or are unable to read or write to such an extent that they are unable to vote without assistance may avail of companion voting or voting with the assistance of the Presiding Officer. Other measures in place include the requirement to have on display at the polling station a large print version of the ballot paper and the inclusion of candidates' photographs and party emblems on the ballot paper. Blind and vision impaired voters will also have the option at the forthcoming elections, referendum and plebiscites to use a ballot paper template to enable them to vote independently. Local Returning Officers are responsible for providing necessary training for their staff, including Presiding Officers, in advance of polling day.<\/p>  <p>  While comprehensive arrangements are in place to assist participation in the electoral process by individuals with physical disabilities, nonetheless my Department continues to seek to improve these arrangements and to have regard to the special needs of such persons.  In this context, I set up a working group on disability voting at the end of 2018, which includes representatives from the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Blind Legal Alliance and the National Disability Authority.  The group is working on improving accessibility to polling stations for voters with physical disabilities, particularly wheelchair users, with the goal of all polling stations being fully accessible as soon as possible. The group is also tasked with other initiatives including the development and improvement of ballot paper templates for the European and local elections; reviewing and updating, as required, the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Accessible Voting Checklist&rsquo;, which addresses improved accessibility within polling stations; and in promoting measures to advance voting accessibility, as set out in Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800110#WRMMM05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architects Register","counter":4140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800110#WRMMM05800"},{"type":"question","counter":4141,"qnumday":1520,"qnumall":"[18554\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800110#WRMMM05900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he receives reports from an organisation (details supplied) on complaints regarding poor performance by architects; if there is oversight of architects outside of their representative body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4142,"content":"<p>The Building Control Act 2007 provides for the registration of persons entitled to use the professional title of architect.

In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and\/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. When a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for fire safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. In multi-unit developments, the \"person having control\" is generally the owner management company. Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the proposal of the Deputy,  it is not possible for the State to take on responsibility\/liability for all legacy issues. Nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance.<\/p>  <p>  Stronger compliance with building standards has been a key priority for Government in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade and my Department has advanced a robust and focused Building Control Reform Agenda, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Amendments to the Building Control Regulations; <\/p>  <p>  - Establishment of the Nation Building Control Management Project and a National Building Control Office; and<\/p>  <p>  - The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.<\/p>  <p>  These reforms have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations<\/p>  <p>  This focus on strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry, and on improving compliance in the building regulations, reduces the risk and the incidences of defective buildings and has provided insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to introduce new latent defect type products in Ireland, despite a general retrenchment and conservatism in the wider insurance industry.

This means that the purchaser does not have to make a claim through the builder but can submit a claim directly to the insurer.

This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability across businesses more equitably, based on modern circumstances. Following revaluation there is a much closer and uniform relationship between contemporary rental values of property and the commercial rates liability of properties. In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the business rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy. <\/p>  <p>  The national revaluation programme currently underway is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 150,000 commercial rateable properties. Completing the first revaluation since the middle of the 19th century and getting properties in every Local Authority area onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations provided for in the legislation represents a sea-change for the rateable valuation system.

This requirement relates to the need for a clear management structure and shared communal facilities for this particular form of development. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the positive effects that institutional investment can have in terms of the supply of housing, not least given the scale of housing development envisaged under the National Planning Framework over the period to 2040, particularly apartment developments in the main urban centres. I understand that, increasingly, institutional investment is being directed towards the funding or forward purchase of new residential construction, which is helpful in increasing the supply of new housing.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, a recent report on institutional investment from the Department of Finance notes that it would not be correct to assume that the properties being bought by institutional investors would otherwise have been bought by first time buyers, with the suggestion being made in the report that much of the stock would likely have been purchased by Buy to Let investors with access to equity, either through their household or business wealth. The benefits of institutional investment are more likely to be indirect; to the extent that it brings about extra supply, it should help affordability across the market as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are already supports in place for first time buyers. These include:<\/p>  <p>  -  The Help-to-Buy (HTB) incentive provides for a refund of Income Tax and DIRT paid over the previous four tax years, up to a maximum of 5% of the purchase value, capped at &euro;20,000. Up to the end of March 2019, 11,557 HTB claims have been made, of which 11,043 are approved. The estimated total value of approved HTB claims to date is in the order of &euro;161.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme allows low-income first time buyers aged between 18 and 70 who cannot secure sufficient mortgage finance from a commercial lender, to access sustainable mortgage finance that is designed to enable them to purchase a new or second-hand property, or undertake a self-build, within a suitable price range at low interest rates. It is subject to certain qualifying criteria and is aimed at improving affordability. Some 1,884 loan applications have been recommended for approval by the Housing Agency&rsquo;s central credit assessment service and up to the end of March 2019, 720 loans to the value of &euro;127.5m had been drawn down, with an average loan value of &euro;177,073. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance report also points to the benefits of professionalising the private rental sector, realising economies of scale, and a resultant improvement in regulatory and taxation compliance standards.<\/p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing rented residential property on a larger scale, provides additional stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility. Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles. There are approximately 340,000 tenancies registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, of which approximately 310,000 are private rented tenancies. The majority of landlords, just over 70%, own just one property, with a further 16% owning just two properties. Almost 86% of the registered rental housing stock is owned by landlords with less than 10 properties, reflecting the fact that the overall proportion of the rental stock held by institutional investors is relatively low.

An overarching action within that Pillar was a commitment to develop a National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy. This Strategy, which I published last July, strives to provide a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland and draws together all of the strands of ongoing work in one document with a clear vision for moving forward in the next few years.<\/p><p>The Strategy acts as an overarching roadmap and a focal point for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across Government to ensure that we are utilising our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible, aiming to return as many recoverable vacant properties back to viable use as possible, increasing the supply of sustainable housing, while also revitalising the vibrancy of local communities.<\/p><p>Specifically with regard to potentially vacant space above retail premises, my Department has recently launched the Bringing Back Homes &ndash; Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings, to help property owners, the public, local authorities and the construction industry to develop vacant buildings and space over commercial property. Bringing Back Homes<i><\/i>aims to help increase housing supply as well as rejuvenate town centres and city streets. Publication of the manual was a commitment under both Rebuilding Ireland and the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy.<\/p><p>The manual provides clear and detailed guidance on the current policy and regulatory requirements applying to development of vacant buildings, containing an outline of the process and issues to be considered when developing existing buildings for residential purposes. It applies these procedures to common building types that lie vacant in towns and cities across Ireland. The manual also provides a suite of reuse options for those common building types and elaborates on the complexity associated with each option giving an overview of the technical requirements associated with creating &lsquo;over the shop&rsquo; space into residential units.<\/p><p>My Department has also made legislative amendments in support of the reactivation of the optimum number of vacant residential properties. New exempted development Regulations, which came into operation in early 2018, allow for the change of use, and any related works, of certain vacant commercial premises to residential use without the need to obtain planning permission. This measure is aimed at facilitating the increased use of existing resources by enabling the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply. Regulations were also introduced late last year to provide clarity on the application of Disability Access Certificates to existing buildings when brought back into reuse.  <\/p><p>In order to more accurately determine the levels of long-term vacant but recoverable dwellings that can be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock, my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the CSO and the local government sector, have developed a survey methodology in relation to locating vacant housing and a pilot field-based survey has commenced across 6 local authorities. Each participating local authority is visually inspecting  approximately 1,200 homes each, recording the location of potentially vacant properties, and where possible, recording apparent reasons for vacancy and categorising each vacant home (with a view to prioritising those which are seen as most likely to be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock). To identify long-term vacancy, the pilot requires two visual inspections, six months apart, with those homes occupied between the two inspections disregarded. The pilot survey will be concluded shortly and the results will be analysed, to assess whether there would be significant value in rolling out the survey on a national basis.<\/p><p>My Department and local authorities have already been proactive in dealing with vacant properties and there are a number of schemes available to incentivise reactivating suitable dwellings into the liveable housing stock. Where the initial national rollout of the innovative Repair and Lease Scheme did not yield the results hoped for, improvements have been made to its terms to make it more desirable to those who wish to bring their vacant property back into use. A Buy and Renew Scheme is also in place through which local authorities can acquire and refurbish vacant residential property for social housing use.<\/p><p>Any financial\/taxation measures for employers to renovate or upgrade residential accommodation for employees would, in the first instance, be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Invitations","counter":4173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN01500"},{"type":"question","counter":4174,"qnumday":1533,"qnumall":"[18742\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN01600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he or his officials or political staff were recipients of tickets and-or hospitality from an organisation (details supplied) during the term of office of a person; the details of each occasion tickets and-or hospitality was provided by the organisation during this period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4175,"content":"<p>In responding to the Deputy's question, I am taking it as referring to the receipt of tickets or hospitality as a result of a person's role in my Department as some officials in my Department undertake invaluable work on a voluntary basis in soccer clubs within their communities and may receive tickets as a result.

I have no plans to introduce additional supports to assist households beyond those who fall within the Pyrite Remediation Scheme, in the manner referred to.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that 2,326 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme. Of the 2,326 applications received so far, 1,892 dwellings have been included in the scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  A further 78 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 205 applications are at the initial Application and Validation stage. 151 applications under the scheme were not successful.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 1,892 dwellings that have been included in the scheme:<\/p>  <p>  - 128 are at remedial works planning stage,<\/p>  <p>  - 42 are at tender \/ tender analysis,<\/p>  <p>  - 214 are under remediation, and<\/p>  <p>  - 1,508 are complete.<\/p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;32 million is available to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year.  This will facilitate the remediation of some 460 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. This will bring to approximately &euro;126m the total funding provided under the scheme since 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Eligibility","counter":4200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN04300"},{"type":"question","counter":4201,"qnumday":1543,"qnumall":"[18913\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN04400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the 2018 review of income eligibility levels for social housing will be finalised and published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4202,"content":"<p>Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. <\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, and the universal social charge.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  There is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. <\/p>  <p>  A valuation for commercial rates purposes is arrived at by estimating the Net Annual Value (NAV) of the property in question, at a specified valuation date. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 as &ldquo;the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant&rdquo;. This definition of Net Annual Value is applied to all rateable properties and classes of business on a nationwide basis including service stations with and without convenience stores or car washing facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based exercise. I am informed that, during a revaluation, the Valuation Office analyses relevant market rental transactions for all rateable properties, in accordance with the legislation, best practice internationally as set out in published Practice Guidance Notes, well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts. The conclusions drawn from that analysis are applied to similarly circumstanced property using the &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; method of valuation, which employs direct comparison with other similar properties. <\/p>  <p>  All valuations determined for rating purposes under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 must reflect open market rental values at the valuation date specified in the relevant Valuation Order made by the Commissioner of Valuation, and must also endeavour to be correct, equitable and uniform. These are fundamental principles of any modern system of rateable valuation. I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that no anomaly exists in the approach to the valuation for rating purposes of the retail elements of service stations. The market data and financial information analysed by the Valuation Office since the first revaluation was conducted in 2005 suggests that the valuation approach adopted in relation to service stations is reflective of the open market and compatible with the statutory requirements of Part 5 of the Valuation Acts. I understand that this has also been affirmed as the appropriate approach in a number of recent Valuation Tribunal decisions.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is also a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law. Appeals are made on an individual case basis. However, the decision in one case can have relevance in other similar cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Rented Accommodation","counter":4217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN06200"},{"type":"question","counter":4218,"qnumday":1550,"qnumall":"[19096\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800111#WRNNN06300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the provision made for older persons who are renting properties and whose tenancies are terminated following the transfer of the property to a vulture fund; and his plans to introduce safeguards for such persons such that they do not find themselves homeless in their retirement.","asker":"1259","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4219,"content":"<p>The Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing aims to ensure that older people have a range of housing choices available to them and there is an overall commitment to examine the potential of targeted schemes to meet differing housing needs.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years with the objective of improving security of tenure for tenants.

Additional funding will be  provided to support local authority enforcement of the new short-term letting arrangements and my Department will be engaging with the relevant local authorities in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed planning reforms will come into effect on 1 July 2019 and the  primary legislative provisions required to underpin the proposals are currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas through the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018. In addition, the necessary supporting planning regulations to further underpin the proposals are currently being finalised and details will be published in due course.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that these proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible type lettings including lettings to those coming to Ireland under temporary employment contracts or those moving employment location and who require temporary accommodation while seeking long-term accommodation etc. Similarly, they will not affect the operation of purpose built student accommodation, for which permissions are typically granted with planning conditions that generally facilitates the use of student accommodation complexes as alternative summer or holiday accommodation but are reserved as student housing during the academic year.  This is on foot of advice provided my Department to planning authorities, by way of Circular Letter PL8\/2016 issued in July 2016, regarding matters to consider in relation to proposals for student accommodation. It was made clear that housing for students is a specific and important segment of the overall housing sector with distinct characteristics and requirements.  Therefore, safeguards are required to ensure that student accommodation is not used as permanent residential accommodation or other uses and is restricted to students during the academic year.  However, planning authorities were reminded of the importance of a steady rental income for such student accommodation developments throughout the year in order to ensure the deliverability of development projects from a funding point of view and to recognise that student accommodation complexes can play an important role in providing affordable accommodation for tourists and visitors in major urban areas during peak summer demand periods.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800112#WROOO00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4229,"content":"<p>Question No. 1553 answered with Question No. 1516.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4230,"content":"<p>Question No. 1554 answered with Question No. 1552.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Infrastructure","counter":4231,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800112#WROOO00900"},{"type":"question","counter":4232,"qnumday":1555,"qnumall":"[19272\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800112#WROOO01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the next steps in the process and the timeframe for the development of a water treatment facility at Lough Talt, County Sligo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4233,"qnumday":1572,"qnumall":"[19604\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800112#WROOO01100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the application for planning under the IROPI process for the new Lough Talt water treatment plant in County Sligo; when the matter will be concluded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4234,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1555 and 1572 together.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 March 2019, I received a statement of case from Sligo County Council that Imperative Reasons of Overriding Public Interest (IROPI) exist in respect of a planning application for the upgrade to the existing water treatment plant at Lough Talt, County Sligo.

The adoption of development contribution schemes is a reserved function of elected members and it is a matter for the elected members to decide and approve the level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, including any exemptions from charging in specific circumstances if that is deemed appropriate, in each local authority.  <\/p>  <p>  My role as Minister is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority. This framework must strike the right balance between ensuring a transparent and broadly consistent levying of development contributions across the country, while also affording each local authority sufficient flexibility and discretion in the application of development contributions within their own respective functional areas.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department issued statutory guidelines to planning authorities in January 2013 under section 28 of the 2000 Act on the implementation of development contribution schemes and to which planning authorities are required to have regard in the performance of their planning functions.

For example, authorities are encouraged to consider reduced or no charges in respect of renewable energy development which is not supplying electricity to the national grid. Authorities are also advised to ensure that their schemes distinguish proportionately between large and small-scale i.e. not to apply the same flat rate charge to particular forms of development irrespective of scale. This recommendation is reflected in most development contribution schemes, with some variation in approach applied by local authorities in this connection having regard to local circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Guidelines also recommended a standard methodology for all planning authorities to follow to ensure that the methodology used in the preparation of a development contribution scheme is clear and broadly consistent. It should be noted that local authorities are best placed to determine their development contribution schemes having regard to their own particular local needs. While it is expected that local authorities ensure that developers make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities in their functional areas, local authorities are advised to be mindful of the policies adopted by other authorities in their immediate area so as to avoid a major divergence in the level of contributions charged, and to take care to avoid setting contributions that are excessively high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800112#WROOO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":4244,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800112#WROOO02200"},{"type":"question","counter":4245,"qnumday":1559,"qnumall":"[19351\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800112#WROOO02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the Valuation Office has a policy on standardisation of rates applicable to solar farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4246,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that solar farms would appear to come within the ambit of Schedule 3 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, and would, therefore, appear to constitute &ldquo;relevant property&rdquo; for rating purposes.

The Authority noted that the results of the trials did not produce a clear recommendation for a secure voting method that is likely to meet the needs of most voters with sight loss. However, the Authority recommended that ballot paper templates be trialed at a future referendum where voters have a simple &lsquo;yes\/no&rsquo; choice, and that the results be monitored and evaluated.<\/p>  <p>  Regulations were subsequently made in 2016 requiring ballot paper templates to be available at future referendums in order to facilitate voters who are blind or vision impaired. Since the making of the regulations, there have been two referendums and the feedback from the blind and vision impaired community on the efficacy of the template has been generally positive. In order to ensure the availability of the referendum templates at all polling stations over the two referendums, 12,000 templates were provided at a cost of &euro;67,518. <\/p>  <p>  Encouraged by the positive feedback on the referendum ballot paper template, further Regulations were made in 2018 requiring a ballot paper template to be available at future Presidential Elections, including the October 2018 election. A total of 8,000 Presidential ballot paper templates were provided at a cost of &euro;56,365. <\/p>  <p>  Estimates, based on returns received from returning officers, indicate that some 1,000 templates were used at the May 2018 referendum and some 750 templates at the October 2018 polls. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, I established a Working Group on Voting Accessibility chaired by my Department with representation from the National Disability Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the National Council for the Blind, the Blind Legal Alliance and Pakflatt &ndash; the company that tendered successfully for the provision of ballot paper templates in Ireland.  I asked the Group to develop ballot paper templates that could be used at the 2019 European Parliament and Local Elections. I am pleased to say that the Working Group was successful in this endeavour, resulting in ballot paper templates now being available for the first time at the European Parliament and Local Elections scheduled for 24 May 2019. The template will also service requirements at any future D&aacute;il elections and I am currently preparing regulations that will require the availability of ballot paper templates at all future elections.<\/p>  <p>  The existing stock of referendum templates is being used in relation to the referendum and plebiscites being held on 24 May 2019. Therefore, there are no additional costs in 2019 in respect of templates used for these polls. The cost of providing templates in 2019 for the European Parliament, Local Elections and any future elections has yet to be finalised.<\/p>  <p>  The ballot paper template at the forthcoming elections consists of raised numbering and corresponding braille to assist the voter in identifying the openings on the template that correspond to the voter preference boxes for the candidates on the ballot paper to which it will be attached. It will operate in conjunction with a &lsquo;freephone - 1800&rsquo; number. Based on the interaction between the tactile features of the template and the information provided on the &lsquo;freephone&rsquo; number, the voter can mark the ballot paper with their voting preferences (1, 2, 3 etc.). The candidate information on the &lsquo;freephone&rsquo; number can be accessed as often as required in advance of polling day and again on polling day at the polling station with a mobile phone, if required.<\/p>  <p>  Another option open to voters with the relevant screen reading technology (eg on their phones, tablets or laptops) is to familiarise themselves with the candidates standing in their European Parliament constituency or local electoral area by accessing the relevant &lsquo;Notice of Poll&rsquo; or &lsquo;candidate details&rsquo; section on the relevant website. <\/p>  <p>  Detailed instructions on the use of the template have been provided to Returning Officers and Presiding Officers.

The objective of the SSF is to support local authorities in the provision of key enabling infrastructure on public lands, to get the sites ready for the delivery of affordable housing for both purchase and rent.  A maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 will be made available per affordable home. On this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes can be facilitated by this measure alone.<\/p>  <p>  On 11 December 2018, I approved in principle an initial 10 projects that were submitted under the first call of the SSF, with funding of &euro;43 million to be allocated.  These projects will have the potential to deliver approximately 1,400 affordable homes from 2020 onwards. The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible.  I issued a second call for proposals under the SSF on 9 April 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's query, &Oacute;&rsquo;Cualann Co-Housing Alliance is a co-operative housing alliance with Approved Housing Body Status.  The inaugural O'Cualann project in Poppintree, Ballymun, Dublin, involved Dublin City Council, AIB and industry professionals and comprised 49 A2 rated 2-bed, 3-bed and 4-bed homes with sales prices ranging from &euro;140,000 to &euro;220,000.  The development was in two phases; phase 1 comprised of 17 houses and is completed and the units are occupied and phase 2 comprises 32 houses, 11 houses of which were completed in August 2018.  My understanding is that in order for &Oacute; Cualann Co-Housing Alliance to be in a position to provide homes within this price range, Dublin City Council provided fully serviced sites at a nominal cost of &euro;1,000 per unit, as well as waiving development contributions and planning fees.  Taking the foregoing into account, the total investment by Dublin City Council approximates to &euro;58,000 per house. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, in terms of Cost Rental, two pilot projects are currently being progressed. Firstly, a development at the Enniskerry Road, Dublin, which will deliver 50 cost rental homes, is being delivered by the Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and two Approved Housing Bodies (Respond and T&uacute;ath). Planning permission for the Enniskerry Road development is currently in place. An application submitted by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for Serviced Sites Fund grant funding for this project has also been successful. Tenders for the project have been assessed and the contract is due to be awarded shortly, with construction expected to commence by the end of this month. <\/p>  <p>  A second project, in St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Emmet Road in Inchicore, is estimated to have the potential to accommodate circa. 470 homes in a high quality development.  The current tenure mix as agreed with my Department is 30% social and 70% cost rental.  Initial estimates of the St. Michael&rsquo;s project by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) indicated that rents of between 15-25% below market are achievable.  The European Investment Bank is also working on this project in terms of financial and advisory services. <\/p>  <p>  These projects will provide very valuable lessons for the development of a national cost rental approach in Ireland and will help to shape the contractual model and specifications for future larger-scale projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800113#WRPPP00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Register","counter":4292,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800113#WRPPP01000"},{"type":"question","counter":4293,"qnumday":1580,"qnumall":"[19768\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800113#WRPPP01100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will issue a report on responses received further to the consultation process to modernise the electoral registration process; when this report will be published; the next steps in the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4294,"content":"<p>A report in relation to the responses received on the consultation process to modernise the electoral registration process is currently being drafted.

An offer is deemed to be reasonable where the dwelling concerned would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the housing needs of the household and, except in an emergency, is located in an area of choice specified by the household. <\/p>  <p>  From engagement with the local authority sector, it has become apparent that the current 12-month sanction is not operating in a manner that sufficiently addresses the potential for households on the waiting list to turn down reasonable housing offers. The refusal of offers can have a serious impact on the efforts by local authorities to manage their social housing letting process effectively and efficiently, lengthening the period ultimately required to complete lettings or re-lettings and resulting in a loss of essential differential rent revenue for extended periods.<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons, I plan to amend the regulations to provide that a household that refuses two reasonable offers in any twelve-month period, other than an offer made under the Choice Based Letting procedure, will not receive any further offers from any local authority for a period of five years. The latter period will not be reckonable subsequently for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for another social housing tenancy. <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the overall level of demand for social housing, I am satisfied that the change proposed is a measured step.

The NPPR charge applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed charge was set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge and any late payment fees applicable.

If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014.  As the charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.  In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen; the legislation does not provide for further penalties to apply after this date.  Consequently the total five year liability due for property owners who have not discharged their NPPR charge is &euro;7,230.<\/p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted.

It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR charge liability from owners.  In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.

Where such fires result in the loss of property, particularly peoples family homes or livelihoods, this can be devastating. The priority of fire services in responding to all such incidents is the protection of life in local communities and among emergency responders. An important secondary objective is working with local communities to try to protect family homes and other property, where it is safe to do so. <\/p>  <p>  Considerable inter-agency efforts have been made to reduce the incidence of wildland fires, led by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, whose Department monitors conditions and issues wildland fire warning notices, That Department has led inter-agency reviews with a view to enhancing the mitigation of wildland\/gorse fires. It is imperative that communities and relevant bodies continue to work together to seek to prevent and control wildland fires. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the deliberate setting of wildfires can also occur.  I encourage people in communities affected by wildland fires to join in efforts to prevent such fires being started and to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in trying to establish and bring to justice anyone who recklessly and deliberately sets wildland fires, thereby threatening the lives, property and the environment of those in the local community and further afield. <\/p>  <p>  The emergency response to such wildfires is subject to well established arrangements where local authority fire services may, through the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) in my Department,  request the assistance of the Defence Forces.

This funding is made up of grant aid of &euro;21 million and a repayable loan of &euro;9 million, given that a repayable loan element was in the original RFT issued by Cork City Council in 2014 and subsequently agreed by Cork City Council during tender negotiations with the developer.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are in ongoing correspondence with Cork City Council  regarding the provision of additional public funding for the development of the Event Centre and  also met with Cork City Council officials in January and March to discuss all aspects around the public funding elements of the project.  <\/p>  <p>  High level meetings have taken place regarding legal and funding requirements. I have attended meetings on this project involving the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on a number of occasions to discuss outstanding matters.  Officials in my Department met with Cork City Council in January and March to discuss all aspects around the public funding elements of the project and continue to liaise with the City Council in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Cork City Council is considering a number of elements of the project; including planning matters, timelines, as well as certain legal and funding issues. All parties are eager for this project to progress and be delivered in accordance with the Public Financial Procedures and the Public Spending Code. <\/p>  <p>  The Cork Event Centre is a Government commitment and the development of a major new event centre in Cork city centre is very much in line with what the Government is seeking to achieve in terms of balanced regional development and sustainable urban development under Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800114#WRQQQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting","counter":4365,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800114#WRQQQ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":4366,"qnumday":1605,"qnumall":"[18626\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050800114#WRQQQ01700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding turf cutting; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":4367,"content":"<p>As set out in my reply to Question No. 227 of 27 February 2019 and as set out in the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, the site referred to in the Deputy's Question is one of the sites being examined as regards the potential for domestic turf cutting on the site in accordance with the provisions of article 6.3 of the EU Habitats Directive. <\/p>  <p>   For the smaller plot of land within the proposed domestic turf cutting area in the south of the site, the results of scientific investigations conclude that turf cutting there would not have an adverse impact on the (ecological) integrity of the special area of conservation site.
