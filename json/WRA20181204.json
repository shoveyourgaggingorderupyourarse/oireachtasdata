Any legislative proposals in this regard would have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit and ensure that it did not have unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion.<\/p><p>The legislation provides that the Central Bank can refuse to grant a licence to a moneylender if it is of the opinion that the cost of credit to be charged is excessive.  Since the Central Bank assumed responsibility for the licensed moneylending sector in 2003, it has not permitted an increase to the maximum APR charged in the sector.  During the Central Bank&rsquo;s engagements with new or potential applicants, it examines, on a case-by-case basis, if the proposed costs of credit are excessive and it has successfully challenged firms in this regard.  Nor has the Bank licensed any moneylender to provide the &lsquo;pay-day loan&rsquo; services that exist in other jurisdictions such as the UK and the Bank will continue to pursue this policy.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has stated its view publicly that the introduction of an interest rate ceiling may not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit, for example if the licensed moneylender chose instead to extend the duration of the loan.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would therefore have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit.  Lower interest rate ceilings could be ineffective and counterproductive in this regard and may result in excluding low income households that have repayment capacity from accessing such credit, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illegal Moneylenders","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[50638\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he is taking to tackle the problem of illegal moneylenders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>The Central Bank regulates the licensed moneylender sector.

I can confirm that the power to increase this cap has not been vested in the Central Bank and therefore whether the 1% per month interest limit for the credit union sector should be increased is a matter for the Minister for Finance, Government and the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the interest rate ceiling on Credit Union loans has been subject to recent discussion in a number of fora.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) - the statutory committee whose function is to advise the Minister for Finance in relation to matters relating to credit unions - published a policy paper on this issue in December 2017 following a survey of credit unions.  In its policy paper on the loan interest rate cap the CUAC recommended that credit unions should be permitted to charge an interest rate on loans greater than the present ceiling of 1% per month, and proposed that the cap be raised to 2% per month.  This change would provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and in so doing may create an opportunity for new product offerings. It is important to note that CUAC's recommendation to increase the loan interest rate ceiling would not mean that credit unions are required to raise their loan interest rates, rather they could apply their own interest rates within the parameters allowed.  The policy paper is available on my Department's website.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the CUAC Report Implementation Group - a group established to oversee and monitor the implementation of recommendations from the CUAC report - has also considered the issue of the increasing the interest rate cap as recommended in the CUAC policy paper.  This group is chaired by my Department and is made up of one member from each of the credit union representative bodies - the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers&rsquo; Association and the National Supervisors Forum - and a member from the Central Bank.  The Implementation Group is currently in the process of finalising its Final Report which will be published shortly.  Following publication of the Final Report, I will review the Implementation Group's recommendation on the loan interest cap, along with the CUAC recommendation already received, and consider if any legislative changes are required.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I should also note that the CUAC recommendation on the interest rate cap is aligned with a similar recommendation that has been put forward recently in the \"Interest Rate Restrictions on Credit for Low-income Borrowers\" report, compiled by the Centre for Co-operative Studies University College Cork on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF05300"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[50687\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the funding available for loans and credit insurance, respectively, by strategic banking Ireland; the number of applications received since its establishment in respect of each of the categories; the number and value of applications that have been approved; the funding and insurance provided; the timeline for applications to be dealt with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the SBCI.  The SBCI is Ireland&rsquo;s national promotional institution for SMEs.  The SBCI does not provide financing directly to SMEs, rather, it uses an on-lending model and works with both banks and non-bank finance providers to make lower-cost finance available to eligible enterprises. The SBCI currently has 3 bank and 3 non-bank on-lenders. <\/p>  <p>  The strategic mission of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs.  The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing activities, which involve the provision of guarantees.  To date, none of the SBCI&rsquo;s funding has been used to support a specific credit insurance product; rather, as I mentioned, it provides guarantees to and engages in the sharing of risk with its partner finance providers, as well as the State and European partners. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the figures sought by the Deputy, I am advised that the SBCI does not obtain details of the number of applications for loans made to its on-lending partners and does not receive loan applications directly from SMEs, due to its on-lending model. Instead, the SBCI only obtains information from its on-lending partners in respect of the number of loans to SMEs that have been sanctioned. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of March 2018, the total volume of SBCI supported lending activity through eight on-lending partners, including loans made under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee schemes, was &euro;972 million to over 24,000 SMEs supporting 129,300. <\/p>  <p>  The Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme are the SBCI&rsquo;s two major risk-sharing guarantee Schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, which has now concluded, a total of approximately &euro;145 million of loans were drawn down by over 4,200 SMES.  These loans were made available through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. SMEs applied directly to those banks for loan approval and these applications were subject to the banks&rsquo; normal credit assessment processes.<\/p>  <p>  Up to &euro;300 million of funding to SMEs and small MidCaps is currently available under the Brexit Loan Scheme.  There is a two-stage application process for this funding.  First, businesses must apply to the SBCI to confirm their eligibility for the Scheme.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges.  The SBCI has advised me that it deals with these eligibility applications within 24 hours.  Then, loans are subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures. The Scheme is available through the AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. <\/p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Brexit Loan Scheme on 28 March 2018 to 23 November 2018, the SBCI has received 307 applications.  Of these, 270 have been deemed eligible to proceed to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the Scheme.  In total, 54 SMEs have progressed to sanction at partner finance provider level to a total value of &euro;12,510,000.<\/p>  <p>  The SBCI also operates the Credit Guarantee Scheme on behalf of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. In the last two years, loans of &euro;28.7 million have been supported under the Scheme providing funding to 190 SMEs. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises&rdquo; applies to applications made to the SBCI&rsquo;s on-lenders that are regulated entities by the Central Bank of Ireland.  This Code requires the finance providers to set out their timelines for dealing with loan applications, which vary depending on the size of the loan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[50692\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400067#WRF05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year cost of the increases to the standard rate cut off point to &euro;50,000 over the next five years (details supplied).","asker":"1242","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the estimated full year cost of increasing the standard rate cut off point for all income tax bands by &euro;14,700 which would bring it to &euro;50,000 for a single person and &euro;100,000 for a couple in a single year, would be approximately &euro;2.3 billion. <\/p>  <p>  This estimated figure has been generated by the Revenue cost model by reference to projected 2019 incomes, calculated on the basis of actual data for the year 2016, the latest year for which returns are available, and adjusted for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

That is why, as part of Budget 2019, I secured &euro;10 million in additional funding to allow the Agency to roll out the next phase of its Regional Property Programme. This brings the Agency's total Exchequer allocation for property next year up to &euro;47m and means that the IDA will have further resources to continue investing in strategic sites, upgrading business parks and constructing buildings across the country. That should help to attract more overseas firms to regional locations and thereby create new employment opportunities. <\/p><p>Whilst the IDA is doing everything within its power to ensure its clients locate outside the country&rsquo;s principal urban areas, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to the regions is not without its challenges. Many overseas firms, for example, will only consider large cities where there is ready access to transport hubs. Companies also often want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises, which means they are more likely to decide to situate themselves in urban areas. <\/p><p>Despite those challenges, real progress is being made in increasing levels of FDI in the regions. In 2017, for example, 70% of all jobs created were outside Dublin, including 45% of all jobs created by IDA clients. Similarly, 65% of all Enterprise Ireland client employment is outside Dublin. This year, meanwhile, has seen a number of very high-profile investments in the regions, including in counties Longford, Sligo and Louth. We are working hard, across Government, to build on that progress and ensure further projects are secured for regional Ireland in the coming years. <\/p><p>I want to stress too that IDA Ireland does its utmost to encourage clients to locate in areas that are most in need of investment. While the final decision is always for the company in question itself to take, the Agency makes a particular effort to promote regional locations. This is reflected in site visit statistics for the first three quarters of 2018, where over half of the total number of 461 visits were to regional areas. A breakdown of site visits this year is set out in the table. <\/p><p>It should also be noted that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.

I myself regularly engage with the IDA - as well as businesses themselves - about the enterprise climate in the country, including with respect to infrastructural issues. I understand that the Agency&rsquo;s assessments of the housing market are based on a wide range of sources and a combination of indices, with the aim of forming the clearest possible picture of how Irish rents compare internationally. These information sources are continuously reviewed and contribute to briefings used by IDA staff. It should be remembered too that the overseas firms that the IDA targets to invest in Ireland &ndash; many of whom are large multinational companies with an existing presence here &ndash; form their own opinions on housing supply and other investment conditions here. <\/p>  <p>  The briefing documents in question highlight a number of indices regarding the Irish property market. They include a 2018 Residential Tenancies Board figure on average rents in Dublin City. Another index, which was sourced from the Nestpick 2017 Furnished Apartment Index, set out an estimate of the costs of renting small furnished apartments across County Dublin in 2017.  I understand that it was not suggested by the IDA that this Nestpick index was an authoritative figure for the entire Dublin property market. Similarly, I understands that the IDA has never advised its staff to underestimate average rents in Ireland to potential investors. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400068#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ticket Touting","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400068#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[50484\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400068#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when she plans to bring forward legislation to tackle the problem of ticket touting; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>At its meeting on 24th July 2018, the Government decided on a package of legislative measures dealing with the resale of tickets for entertainment and sporting events.

Figures show that employment continues to grow strongly with 66,700 jobs created in the year from Q3 2017 to Q3 2018. This brings total employment to 2,273,200. <\/p>  <p>  The number of people in employment has increased in six of the eight regions in the year from Q3 2017 to Q3 2018. The exception to this is the Mid-West (which has remained static) and the Border region.<\/p>  <p>  In the West Region, in the year to Q3 2018, an extra 5,100 people were in employment. In the same period, there were 1,100 fewer people unemployed in the Region. <\/p>  <p>  Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made regional development my top priority. Indeed, enterprise development and job creation in the regions of Ireland is a key policy priority of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) we committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 percent in each region by 2020 and to bring and\/or maintain unemployment levels in each  region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.   <\/p>  <p>  Since the launch of the RAPJ there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside Dublin entering employment in that period.<\/p>  <p>  That is over 63% - or 3 out of every 5 jobs created &ndash; for regions outside of Co. Dublin (Q1 2015 &ndash; Q3 2018). <\/p>  <p>  In the year from Q3 2017 &ndash; Q3 2018, just over half (51%) of the jobs created were outside of Co. Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The West has seen good progress under the RAPJ, with employment in the region increasing by 15.7% from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018. There are 28,400 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Live Register numbers have fallen in all three counties in the West Region in the past 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the West Region is currently at 6.6% (Q3 2018), which is slightly higher than the State average but is within one percentage point of the State average. <\/p>  <p>  The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the West of 7% and 5% respectively. Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in 2017, had 628 client companies in the West employing 3,057 people. This is an increase of 152 jobs from 2016. <\/p>  <p>  IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The West Region Action Plan for Jobs has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Midlands, working with public and private stakeholders. In April of this year, I met with the Chairs of all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees and other regional stakeholders, to start a process to Refresh and Refocus all Regional Plans, including the West Region Plan, to ensure their effectiveness, relevance and impact out to 2020, particularly in light of Brexit. This work is ongoing at present and the Plans are due to be completed by the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  On Monday, under the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), I announced an allocation of just over &euro;29 million in funding that will support regions throughout the country to deliver on their economic and enterprise development potential. <\/p>  <p>  21 projects from all over the country received funding. This is in addition to the &euro;30 million in funding under Call 1 of the REDF that I announced in December 2017 that also funded 21 projects. The REDF is being rolled out by my Department, through Enterprise Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Over the first and seconds calls under the REDF, the West Region secured funding of over &euro;7.1 million across four projects.<\/p>  <p>  Under Call 2 of the REDF I announced:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2.4 million for Galway City Innovation District to provide coworking space, private office space and event space for scaleup companies and a landing site for FDI companies.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2 million for the development of a market-focused Marine Innovation and Development Centre at Midc P&aacute;irc Na Mara.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;182,786 for the Burren Lowlands project that will create a focus point for the development of activities to create and attract additional jobs to this area.<\/p>  <p>  These three projects are in addition to the funding received by the BIA Innovator Campus under the first call, which will support food entrepreneurship in the West.<\/p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (NPF), as part of Project Ireland 2040, aims to guide the future development of Ireland over the next 20+ years, and to influence the spatial patterns of a projected 1 million increase in our population. The NPF and the 10-year National Development Plan have been developed in alignment with each other in order to explicitly link spatial planning policy and infrastructure capital investment. Taken together, will help unlock the potential in the regions. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is focused on unlocking the potential in the regions. Co-ordinated delivery of infrastructure, at the same time as enabling regional enterprise development under Project Ireland 2040, should help to better distribute our future anticipated population growth across the whole country &ndash; while also tackling congestion and quality of life issues. <\/p>  <p>  The next step in the delivery of the National Planning Framework involves the development of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) for each of three regions (Eastern-Midlands, Southern, North-Western). These will provide a statement of regional ambition and articulate the unique characteristics of each region, with a focus on the interaction between spatial policy and enterprise opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, and the enterprise development agencies, have been engaging pro-actively with each of the Regional Assemblies to ensure that national enterprise and innovation policies are reflected in the draft strategies. It is our view that the RSESs should have a focus on &lsquo;place-making&rsquo; to facilitate the creation of concentrated settlements, in which people can live and work in a vibrant environment, and public services can be efficiently provided as envisaged by the Ireland 2040 plan. We know that there is a strong interdependence between the planning and development of attractive places and where companies will choose to establish, invest and create jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400068#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arms Trade","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[50440\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the value of individual dual-use licences for exports to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates issued in 2017 and the first six months of 2018.","asker":"1259","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>Information on export licences issued by my Department during 2017 are contained in the annual report for 2017, which I published in August 2018, as required by the Control of Exports Act 2008.

A panel of independent international experts comprised of both technical and commercialisation experts was also formed to assess applications.<\/p>  <p>  Under Call 1, all the Expression of Interest (EOI) forms were screened for eligibility. Only eligible applications were put forward for assessment by the Advisory Board and the panel of experts. Assessment of these eligible applications was based on the selection criteria set out in the guidelines for this fund, but briefly they are: 1.) the strength of the disruptive technology dimension; 2.) economic and market impact of the proposal; 3.) the quality and efficiency of the collaboration; and 4.) the overall excellence of the proposed approach.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions on Expressions of Interest were made in September 2018 and were communicated to the lead partner of all collaborations. Only those applicants that met all of the eligibility criteria and met the minimum threshold of the Selection Criteria were invited to submit a full application. Projects that are deemed ineligible for this first call under the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (DTIF) may still be able to apply in subsequent calls. <\/p>  <p>  45 consortia were invited to submit a full application to be received by 12.00 noon on 5th November. Since that date, the panel of international experts has been assessing the detailed applications against the same selection criteria as set out above and interviewing each consortium that submitted a valid application.<\/p>  <p>  The DTIF Advisory Board has met in recent days to review the outcome of the international assessment of the projects and I will be provided with the recommendations of the Advisory Board in the near future.  I expect to make an announcement about the first tranche of projects to receive an offer of DTIF funding later in December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[50266\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps she is taking to assist companies in the Border counties to be prepared for Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on Friday 30 November last, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.   <\/p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland (ITI) works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships on account of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.<\/p>  <p>  ITI also offers vouchers which enable companies to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in the Border Regions are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 263 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. <\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, in Meath, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). Taking the first and second calls of the REDF together, the Border Region had seven successful projects with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region. <\/p>  <p>The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.      <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is also actively engaging with companies in the Border Region.  The Agency recently met with the Killybegs Harbour Group which is a mix of industries and companies and explained the suite of supports available.<\/p>  <p>  In November, EI ran a Spotlight on Skills Workshop in Carrickmacross, Monaghan. The aim of the Spotlight on Skills Workshops is to assist client companies to identify their critical skills needs, and to support the growth of their businesses. <\/p>  <p>  EI also recently supported the Enterprise Europe Network Meet the Buyer event focused on Engineering Companies in the Border Region. The event, organised out of Donegal Local Enterprise Office (LEO) office, took place in Combilift in Monaghan and was attended by a mix of EI, LEO and Invest NI Clients. <\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want business, particularly around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement Investigations","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[50499\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when she plans to publish an account of the investigative failures identified by a judge and the steps being taken to address them emanating from the trial of a person (details supplied); and the status of action points committed to in the report \"Measures to Enhance Ireland's Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework\" published in November 2017.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>The account of the investigative shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer was published today on the website of my Department.

Our most recent SME survey published earlier this year found that 44% of all businesses strongly impacted by Brexit have a plan in place &ndash; almost twice as many as a year previously. It is planned to rerun this survey early in the new year. <\/p><p>More recently, a survey of 2,400 Enterprise Ireland clients found that 85% of firms are taking Brexit-related actions.

This Forum meets regularly and provides a vehicle for discussion of enterprise, trade and investment policy implications arising from wider global challenges, with a specific focus on Brexit.<\/p><p>In terms of sectors and regions of concern, my Department has undertaken a wide range of studies into the possible impacts of Brexit and a number of these have highlighted the potential regional effects associated with the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.<\/p><p>Amongst a range of studies undertaken and funded by my Department, the Copenhagen Economics study &ldquo;Ireland and the impact of Brexit: Strategic implications for Ireland arising from changing EU-UK Trading Relations&rdquo;, published earlier this year, identified the most vulnerable sectors in respect of Brexit.<\/p><p>The study found that 5 sectors account for 90% of the possible economic impact. They are agri-food, pharma-chemicals, engineering and machinery, wholesale and retail and air transport. Around 80% of the employment in these sectors is outside the Dublin region. As noted in the study, Brexit will therefore be felt more in rural parts of the country where these sectors dominate, particularly agri-food. <\/p><p>From a regional perspective, the Regional Action Plan for Jobs is central to my Department&rsquo;s targeted approach to boosting regional employment. While progress has been very good, it is clear that we also have new challenges since the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process started, not least Brexit. In this context, I have asked the Implementation Committees in each region to lead a process to refresh and refocus their Plans to 2020 which will focus on building each region&rsquo;s own competitive advantage, develop areas that are already strong, examine vulnerabilities and take account of the challenges that Brexit presents.<\/p><p>For 2019, I am allocating an extra &euro;8 million to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, who work with firms to develop their supports for business. I have also allocated an additional &euro;5m to the Local Enterprise Offices for 2019 to increase their Brexit supports to businesses in every county. <\/p><p>The level of uptake of these supports shows that businesses are aware of the assistance on offer and are engaging with various initiatives and schemes that have been made available. For instance, the EI &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. To date, 2,962 Brexit Scorecards have been completed.  <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland has run eight Brexit advisory clinics throughout the country to date.  Approximately 590 people have attended these events and three more clinics are due to take place before the end of the year in Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick.<\/p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. 3,925<b><\/b>participants have taken part in these events.

However, overseas firms &ndash; who my Department and the IDA regularly engage with about issues that affect their capacity to invest here &ndash; understand how much of a priority the Government has placed on addressing this problem. They know that we are working hard to increase supply and that the overall national trend is now one of steady progress and improvement. <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains fully focused on doing everything it can to address the housing situation. That is why we published the &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan&rsquo;, which includes an array of measures to improve the availability of homes in this country. The primary objective is ensuring that people and families, across Ireland, have better access to quality and affordable housing. The work undertaken to improve housing also serves to reinforce our national infrastructure in terms of its capacity to accommodate further foreign direct investment (FDI).<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made on the action plan. As reflected in the November Monthly Housing Activity Report, construction and housing supply are improving. There have been steady increases in the number of planning permissions, commencement notices, registrations and the availability of new houses, all of which will help alleviate pressures on housing supply. The launch of the Land Development Agency will also help to achieve greater stability in the housing market.  <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, we should not forget that the States Ireland competes with for FDI often have difficulties of their own. Thankfully, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting mobile investment are well known in the global marketplace. Businesses continue to be attracted here because of our talented workforce, membership of the EU and pro-enterprise policy environment. These aspects of our value proposition remain strong and continue to position Ireland as a favoured location for FDI. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Funding","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[50519\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of the scoping of a future cycle of PRTLI that was undertaken by her Department working with the Department of Education and Skills; when this exercise will be completed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>The current Cycle 5 of the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions (PRTLI) was announced in 2010 and has involved exchequer expenditure of approx. &euro;277m with a further &euro;59m of private investment.  Cycle 5 projects have now been completed and my Department is addressing the remaining payments associated with these awards. In addition to supporting the provision of top-class research infrastructure (buildings, laboratories and cutting-edge equipment), PRTLI saw significant investment in human capital development, through Structured PhD\/Emergent Technology programmes across Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes (HEIs). <\/p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, the Government's strategy for research and innovation, includes an action to scope out and develop a successor to PRTLI to support new investment in research infrastructure, including buildings and equipment.  It also contains an action to increase the enrolment of PhD and research masters students. The scoping of a future cycle of PRTLI has been undertaken by my Department, working with the Department of Education and Skills (DES). <\/p>  <p>  While future cycles of PRTLI are referenced in the National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040, it is important to note that actions are already being taken by DBEI and DES to fund all of the key elements that had been encompassed by PRTLI including research buildings, equipment and structured PhD programmes.  These actions include:<\/p>  <p>  - DBEI, through Science Foundation Ireland, has allocated more than &euro;50m for research equipment across the higher education system since the start of 2016. SFI will announce shortly the results of its 2018 Research Infrastructure Call, providing significant additional investment for research equipment.<\/p>  <p>  - DBEI, again through Science Foundation Ireland, has commenced roll-out of a new &euro;100 million programmes of investment in PhDs and Research Masters through new Centres for Research Training (CRT). The annual budget for this programme will increase to &euro;15 million from 2019. The CRT programme will provide training for cohorts of Research Masters and PhD students with new cohorts of students enrolling each year for four years from 2019. It will provide training for 600 postgraduate students in areas of nationally and internationally identified future skills needs of digital, data and ICT. <\/p>  <p>  - The Department of Education and Skills also announced funding in the context of Budget 2018 and 2019 to address the need for physical space for research in the higher education sector.  This included Budget 2018 announcements of &euro;200m for public private partnerships in the Institute of Technology sector and &euro;257m for investment in the higher education sector generally, including for research. Budget 2019 then saw announcements of &euro;57 million to be invested in higher education initiatives in 2019 along with capital investment of &euro;150 million being allocated to the higher education, further education and training and research sectors. Project Ireland 2040 signals a significant commitment in capital investments in the region of &euro;2.8 billion by the Department of Education and Skills in higher education over the coming decade, this includes public private partnership investments and support for research.  <\/p>  <p>  The actions being taken by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills are addressing to a significant degree the requirements for increased investment in both physical infrastructure and human capital in higher education research as identified in Innovation 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Data","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[50502\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of regional IDA site visits in addition to vacant IDA properties nationwide in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>The Government is doing everything possible to ensure the best possible distribution of foreign direct investment (FDI) across the country. Progress is being made towards that goal. In 2017, for example, IDA Ireland secured 99 regional investments with 45% of all new jobs created outside Dublin. The last three years have also seen 30,000 new FDI jobs created outside Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  The availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA's ability to compete for mobile FDI and win new investment for regional Ireland. Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure job-rich investment but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing many difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is therefore an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that IDA Ireland owns 30 properties across the country. Of these, 13 are currently occupied by IDA clients with a further 17 properties available for prospective or existing investors.<\/p>  <p>  Excluding Dublin, there has been a total of 252 site visits across Ireland in the first three quarters of 2018. Such site visits remain an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that overseas firms consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland. This is in line with the priority that has been placed on investment outside of our main cities, with the Agency continuing to target an increase in investment of 30% to 40% in every region of the country by the end of its current strategy in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It should, however, be emphasised that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the firm concerned. It is also the case that some companies will only consider investing in urban areas, for a variety of commercial reasons. Site visit activity also does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400069#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[50512\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the additional jobs added in the 12 months to the third quarter of 2018 in County Donegal from the latest labour force survey.","asker":"1244","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available. <\/p><p>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the official source of estimates of employment in the State.

The PSSA also sets out the policy on public service pension increases as adopted by Government for the duration of that agreement to end-2020, whereby some public service pensions qualify to be increased on foot of those pay increases.  <\/p>  <p>  Due to the 2010 public service pay cuts and the &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; protections associated with those reductions, former public servants who retired before 1 March 2012 have their pensions based on higher &lsquo;pre-cut&rsquo; salary levels.  This has led to the situation whereby those who retired since 1 March 2012, on a like-for-like basis, generally receive lower pensions than their counterparts who retired before them.  <\/p>  <p>  Under Section 6.2 of the PSSA, a guiding principle of current pension increase policy is the need to adopt an equitable approach whereby those who retired since 1 March 2012 first &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; with their counterparts who retired before them on higher pension rates.  The policy out to end-2020 also provides that the benefit of the PSSA pay increases will be passed on to qualifying pre-March 2012 pensioners, but only where the pensions of those who retired since March 2012 with analogous retiring rank, pensionable service etc. have moved ahead of their pre-March 2012 retirees.  <\/p>  <p>  In effect, for pensions payable under &lsquo;pre-2013&rsquo; public service pension schemes including the Defence Forces (i.e. pre-Single Pension Scheme), current policy means a limited resumption of the pre-FEMPI non-statutory &lsquo;pay parity&rsquo; model, under which pension rates rose in line with pay increases. <\/p>  <p>  As regards military pensioners who retired since 1 March 2012, I am advised that, generally speaking, the benefit of the recent pay increases including the 1% from 1 January 2018 and 1% from 1 October 2018 under the PSSA has now been passed on (with arrears) to those concerned, including any associated dependants.  A small residual number of qualifying pensioners will get the benefit with their December 2018 monthly pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[50280\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the public events he attended by county since 1 May 2018 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>The following table contains details of the Defence related public events I attended in my capacity as Minister of State with Responsibility for Defence in the period 1 May to 29 November 2018.<table><tr><th>COUNTY<\/th><th>EVENT<\/th><th>DATE<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>IT Carlow Graduation in Carlow<\/td><td>1 November 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>HRH Prince Charles visit to Haulbowline Naval Base Cork<\/td><td>14 June 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Naval Service Commissioning<\/td><td>22 June 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>L&Eacute; James Joyce returning from the Med<\/td><td>27 October 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Arbour Hill Ceremony Dublin<\/td><td>9 May 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Veterans Day Collins Barracks<\/td><td>13 May 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Mass in Arbour Hill<\/td><td>24 June 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>UN60 Commemoration Dublin Castle<\/td><td>24 June 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Launch of Fuchsia ONE Appeal<\/td><td>27 June 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>National Day of Commemoration<\/td><td>8 July 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Unveiling of Commemorative stone Glasnevin Cemetary<\/td><td>27 July 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Wreath laying Glasnevin Cemetary<\/td><td>19 August 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Pope&rsquo;s Visit<\/td><td>25 August 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Pope&rsquo;s Visit<\/td><td>26 August 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin <\/td><td>DSM Presentation<\/td><td>4 September 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>UNDOF Review Cathal Brugha<\/td><td>19 September 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Prime Time RTE<\/td><td>2 October 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Defence Forces Annual Gala Concert NCH<\/td><td>20 October 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Air Corps Commissioning Baldonnel<\/td><td>2 November 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Inauguration of President<\/td><td>11 November 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Civil Defence Awarding of Drone Licences<\/td><td>24 November 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Irish Red Cross Ball<\/td><td>24 November 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>113 Bn Review Galway<\/td><td>26 October 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>Cadet Class Intake Curragh<\/td><td>24 September 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>UNIFIL REVIEW Dundalk<\/td><td>2 May 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>PDFORRA Conference <\/td><td>3 October 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>Opening of ONE Centre Athlone<\/td><td>17 October 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>ONE Annual Mass Wexford<\/td><td>27 May 2018<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[50336\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has the same power as the Garda Commissioner in terms of the organisation of work and working times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>Civil and military staff in the Department of Defence have worked closely together on examining issues arising for the Defence Forces related to the Working Time Directive.

Most recently, on 27 November, I updated the Government on progress on the necessary facilities and infrastructure for such checks and controls at Dublin Port, Rosslare Port and Dublin Airport.<\/p><p>Dedicated measures to get Ireland Brexit ready were announced in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Budget 2019 measures included the introduction of a new longer-term loan scheme of up to &euro;300 million, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business. This scheme will be jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This is in addition to announcements in previous budgets where over &euro;450 million was allocated in business supports, including Budget 2018&rsquo;s &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme for Business.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 also included an allocation of &euro;115 million for Brexit measures across a number of Departments. This includes a &euro;25 million allocation for essential customs requirements. There is also increased funding to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to enable them to continue to address the challenges posed by Brexit across a range of headings, including supports for our Enterprise Agencies and for our <i>&lsquo;<\/i>Global Ireland&rsquo; &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025 strategy. This strategy will support the opening of new markets for our businesses and a higher international profile. Increased funding to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has already provided for the opening of 13 new diplomatic missions as part of Global Ireland 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets. As well as addressing the challenge of Brexit, our trade and investment strategy<i><\/i>Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World has at its core our ongoing commitment to the EU and access to a Single Market of 27 Member States with 450 million people post Brexit, as well as access to a further 53 markets under EU Free Trade Agreements.<\/p><p>The funding provided to Departments in Budget 2019 includes a &euro;78m package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs related to Brexit. This package includes dedicated funds to support infrastructure and innovation, including: &euro;6 million in funding to progress an &euro;8m Food Innovation Hub in Teagasc Moorepark; &euro;13m in supports for food industry competitiveness and innovation; &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process of recruitment of additional staff to carry out the greatly increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit; and an initial provision of just over &euro;3m to address ICT hardware and software requirements.<\/p><p>Good long-term planning supported by investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure also has an important to play is ensuring the resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s economy in the face of Brexit. The National Development Plan (NDP) 2018 &ndash; 2027 comprises an investment programme of &euro;116 billion. Investments which will be particularly relevant to Brexit include the integration of transport, energy and communications networks; new resources for tourism development and promotion; and supporting Brexit-exposed firms to diversify to international markets. <\/p><p>The Government and state agencies are also working hard to fully exploit any opportunities from Brexit. This includes promoting Ireland as an English speaking member of the EU with unfettered access to the EU market, and as a preferred destination for inward investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD05900"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[50067\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD06000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount of funding and-or grant aid his Department has made to an association (details supplied) from 1 January 2008 to 2017 and to date in 2018; the purpose for which the funding and-or grant aid was released to the association; if the way in which the funding and-or grant aid is used is audited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has funded the Football Association of Ireland during the period 2017 to date through both the Emigrant Support Programme and the Reconciliation Fund.<\/p><p>The UK Welfare Officer programme was established in 2008 and was supported jointly by the Football Association of Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme (ESP). <\/p><p>The programme provided assistance, support, advice and counselling services to Irish players aged 16+ that moved to the UK to become involved in the UK professional football game. <\/p><p>To ensure ongoing quality control, and in addition to ongoing monitoring and evaluation of projects based on reporting by organisations and visits by Missions, the Department commissions a number of on-site, external audits each year.

A reduced fee is applied on applications for passports for minors in recognition of the fact that a minor&rsquo;s passport is valid for only five years. Most adult passports will be issued for a period of ten years.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked my staff to review the cost of the standard ten year adult Irish passport and to compare it to the cost of a similar passport in many other jurisdictions. I am satisfied that, at a cost of &euro;80, which breaks down to &euro;8 per year, the Irish passport fee compares favourably with the services offered elsewhere. For example, an adult would have to pay &euro;8.20 per year for a British passport, &euro;8.60 per year for a French passport, &euro;9.75 per year for an American passport and &euro;18.10 per year for an Australian passport.<\/p>  <p>  Based on 2017 application volumes, the Passport Service has calculated the potential annual cost of reducing the passport application fee to &euro;60 for applicants over 75 years of age to be just under half a million euros. Given that any shortfall in revenue would have to be met by the taxpayer, a decision to waive or reduce the application fee for any category of applicant would require careful consideration. It is important to ensure that the major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements which have taken place in recent years can be maintained and further developed. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the services provided by the Passport Service, I would like to draw attention to the well-advanced Passport Reform Programme, one element of which is the Online Passport Renewal Service which was launched on 30 March 2017. To date over 298,000 adults have renewed their passport using this online facility. <\/p>  <p>  The Online Passport Renewal Service has recently expanded to include the online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, to introduce a passport card for children and to expand the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. The service brings significant benefits for citizens with faster turnaround times of 10 working days for all online applications, excluding postage.  In addition, the cost of renewing a passport online is significantly cheaper than alternative methods, with fees for all online applications being reduced by &euro;5 across all application types.  The expanded service is now available to all adults and children who wish to renew their passport.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst the online service does not distinguish between applicants based on age, applicants can be assured that the online system will be the cheapest as well as the most efficient, secure and convenient way to apply to renew their passport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400070#WRD06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[50231\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of passport applications for persons (details supplied).","asker":"1268","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>All passport applications are subject to the provisions of the Passports Act 2008 as amended (&ldquo;the 2008 Act&rdquo;).

The conflict was sparked, more than seven years ago, by brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime. The conduct of the conflict, including the use of chemical weapons and medieval &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; tactics, is estimated to have cost the lives of over 400,000 people. It has led to a situation in which 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.<\/p><p>Sanctions are a tool which the international community may use to put political pressure on those who commit violence against their own people. Targeted EU sanctions are in place against people and entities that are complicit in the violent repression of the civilian population in Syria. The first person on this EU list is Bashar Al Assad, whose brutal pursuit of this conflict, neglecting all opportunities to seek a political solution, has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. There are numerous barriers to humanitarian access in Syria as a result of actions by the parties to the conflict, particularly the Assad regime.<\/p><p>Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the Assad regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation in Syria justifies these measures.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The EU&rsquo;s Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures state that &ldquo;Sanctions should be targeted in a way that has maximum impact on those whose behaviour we want to influence. Targeting should reduce to the maximum extent possible any adverse humanitarian effects or unintended consequences for persons not targeted &hellip;.&rdquo; Accordingly, the EU&rsquo;s Syria sanctions include specific exemptions for essential civilian needs and for humanitarian assistance. Ireland has been a consistent advocate for ensuring such exemptions are included. <\/p><p>In line with the EU strategy on Syria, the EU is maintaining its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters as long as the repression of civilians continues. To repeal these sanctions could be misconstrued as tacit acquiescence in the actions of the Assad regime and therefore serve to encourage a belief in impunity with regard to attacks on civilians, and disregard for the UN-led peace process. <\/p><p>The EU does however keep the impact of sanctions under constant review, and will consider options to mitigate any unintended consequences which can be documented as relating directly to the measures themselves, as distinct from the more general economic disruption caused by the conflict. The relevant working groups in Brussels propose options to address any unintended negative impacts where they are identified. Those who are working to deliver aid in the complex environment inside Syria constantly assess the impact of various factors, including sanctions, on their ability to deliver aid, and where relevant issues arise, officials from my Department raise these matters in discussions at EU level.<\/p><p>For example, in 2016 the EU amended the Syria sanctions regime to make it easier for NGOs operating in Syria to buy fuel. In 2017, EU Member States including Ireland consulted with NGOs to identify any further difficulties they were experiencing in carrying out humanitarian work in Syria that may have been linked to the sanctions. Based on the feedback of the NGOs, the European Commission published a Frequently Asked Questions document to clarify certain provisions of the sanctions identified as unclear by NGOs, as well as the humanitarian exemptions and derogations. In April of this year, EU Member States reviewed best practice guidelines on humanitarian exemptions, with a view to facilitating the work of NGOs responding to humanitarian crises, including the crisis in Syria. I welcome the ongoing work to implement the findings of previous reviews. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[50284\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the public events he attended by county since 1 May 2018 and to date in 2018;

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.<\/p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. More than 400,000 people have died and an estimated 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalisation Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place last week.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peace building. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.<\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Birth Certificates","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[50309\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding an application by a person (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>The application for Foreign Birth Registration to which the Deputy referred was approved on 24 October 2018.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is monitoring developments closely and remains committed to supporting the advancement of human rights in the region.  <\/p>  <p>  I wholly condemn any intimidation or violence against those seeking to defend their rights, and I would like to extend my sympathies to all those effected.  A free, fair, and open civil society space is essential for a democratic society that functions for all. <\/p>  <p>  Guatemala has made some advances in its political and social development over the past two decades, since the gradual cessation of armed conflict from 1996 onwards.  While overcoming the legacy of human rights crimes committed during the country&rsquo;s three decades of civil war remains a challenge, it is an essential element of Guatemala&rsquo;s development as a democratic society.

The relentless processes by which Palestinians are pressured from their homes and off the land, in order to make way for Israeli settlers, are a daily reminder of the urgency of bringing this occupation to an end. These processes include the impossibility of obtaining planning permission for permanent structures, demolitions, denial of fair access to water for farming and livestock, and a legal regime which leaves many ordinary civilians governed by Israeli military law, rather than being governed by laws and judges who represent the community being governed.<\/p>  <p>  We have on many occasions discussed specific cases here in the Oireachtas. These policies are in evidence across the Occupied Territories: in East Jerusalem, in communities such as Khan al Ahmar, across the West Bank, and on the Golan Heights. They constitute institutionalised injustice against the people under occupation. I made a statement specifically on the situation in Khan al Ahmar in May of this year, noting that this vulnerable Bedouin community, who have already been expelled once by Israel from their former homes in the Negev area, are again threatened unjustly with forced removal, and calling on the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.    <\/p>  <p>  As I have reported on many occasions, these concerns form a constant element in our dialogue with the Israeli authorities, whether at Ministerial level, or at diplomatic and official level. I stated the Government&rsquo;s views on settlements directly with Israeli authorities during my visits to Israel and Palestine in July 2017 and January and June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also pursues this issue in UN fora. At Israel&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council in January, Ireland raised the continued expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, and urged that Israel abide by its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population under military occupation. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of settlements also forms a major element in the concerns expressed by the European Union about Israeli policies, and Ireland inputs strongly into EU discussions on these matters. I and my EU colleagues have particularly highlighted our concerns about the village of Khan al Ahmar on a number of occasions.  <\/p>  <p>  The continuation of the settlement project is a major obstacle to peace negotiations, and undermines the credibility of Israel&rsquo;s commitment to a peaceful solution to the conflict. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft Landings","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE03300"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[50763\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400071#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if an aircraft (details supplied) was given a permit to land at Shannon Airport; if so, the reason therefor; the investigation that took place to determine whether its flights through Shannon Airport were linked to the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza in November 2018 in view of the role of the Israeli military and government against Palestinians, with the support of the United States of America; and the attempts made to inspect the aircraft on either date that it landed at the airport.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, made under the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1946, gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The landing permission for this aircraft was granted on 25 October and was subject to the strict conditions that apply to overflights and landings by any and all foreign military aircraft; namely that the aircraft is unarmed, carries no arms, ammunition or explosives, is not engaged in intelligence gathering, and that the flight in question does not form any part of military exercises or operations.

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption. There is no specific exemption from the requirement to pay LPT for pensioners or older persons under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), though such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions. <\/p>  <p>  The Inter-departmental Group considered the provision of deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship. Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) accordingly provides for  a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds.  These deferral arrangements also take account of mortgage interest payments made by the property owner. <\/p>  <p>  The property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person and his or her gross income must be below certain thresholds.  The thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple.  Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.<\/p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting. The Government is aware of the difficulties facing many individuals and families, and for this reason a wide variety of methods for payment of the LPT are available from which liable persons can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  A review of the LPT is currently being finalised that is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments. It includes an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax.

For Significant Institutions, a Joint Supervisory Team (JST), led by the ECB and consisting of both ECB and Central Bank supervisors directly supervise these firms. On-site inspections are one of the tools used in supervision. Such inspections are carried out in line with the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) supervisory processes, procedures, methodologies and manuals.

The reduction in the number of missions undertaken in Significant Institutions (those banks directly supervised by the ECB) since 2015 is connected with the continued evolution of the approach, and the application of a consistent, targeted engagement level across the SSM.

Members of the public and licensed moneylenders are encouraged to report any suspicions of illegal moneylending to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>As at 31 December 2014 there were 38 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. <\/p><p>As at 31 December 2015 there were 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. <\/p><p>As at 31 December 2016 there were 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. <\/p><p>As at 31 December 2017 there were 40 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. <\/p><p>As at 29 November 2018 there are 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s public register of moneylenders sets out the District Court districts in which each licensed moneylender is permitted to operate.  Currently, 28 moneylenders are permitted to operate in all districts. S.I. 172\/2013 (available on <i>www.irishstatutebook.ie<\/i>), sets out the up to date list of District Court districts and their related areas.<\/p><p>Each moneylender&rsquo;s licence (which can be found on the Central Bank&rsquo;s Register of Moneylenders, available at the following link: <i>) <\/i>includes details of the duration, maximum APR, maximum cost of credit and the collection charge (if any) of the loans which can be offered by a licensed moneylender.  Licensed moneylenders are prohibited from applying additional charges (other than a collection charge) to a moneylending agreement and are also prohibited from applying any additional charges in the event of a default in the payments due under the agreement (i.e., the total amount repayable by a consumer is limited to the amount specified in the moneylending agreement). <\/p><p>The Consumer Credit Act 1995, the legislation under which moneylenders are licensed, does not provide for an APR\/interest rate cap.  Nor does the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010.  Therefore, the Central Bank has no statutory power to impose a market wide cap on rates.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit and ensure that it did not have unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion.<\/p><p>The legislation provides that the Central Bank can refuse to grant a licence to a moneylender if it is of the opinion that the cost of credit to be charged is excessive.  Since the Central Bank assumed responsibility for the licensed moneylending sector in 2003, it has not permitted an increase to the maximum APR charged in the sector.  During the Central Bank&rsquo;s engagements with new or potential applicants, it examines, on a case-by-case basis, if the proposed costs of credit are excessive and it has successfully challenged firms in this regard.  Nor has the Bank licensed any moneylender to provide the &lsquo;pay-day loan&rsquo; services that exist in other jurisdictions such as the UK and the Bank will continue to pursue this policy.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has stated its view publicly that the introduction of an interest rate ceiling may not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit, for example if the licensed moneylender chose instead to extend the duration of the loan.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would therefore have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit.  Lower interest rate ceilings could be ineffective and counterproductive in this regard and may result in excluding low income households that have repayment capacity from accessing such credit, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illegal Moneylenders","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[50638\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he is taking to tackle the problem of illegal moneylenders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>The Central Bank regulates the licensed moneylender sector.

I can confirm that the power to increase this cap has not been vested in the Central Bank and therefore whether the 1% per month interest limit for the credit union sector should be increased is a matter for the Minister for Finance, Government and the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the interest rate ceiling on Credit Union loans has been subject to recent discussion in a number of fora.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) - the statutory committee whose function is to advise the Minister for Finance in relation to matters relating to credit unions - published a policy paper on this issue in December 2017 following a survey of credit unions.  In its policy paper on the loan interest rate cap the CUAC recommended that credit unions should be permitted to charge an interest rate on loans greater than the present ceiling of 1% per month, and proposed that the cap be raised to 2% per month.  This change would provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and in so doing may create an opportunity for new product offerings. It is important to note that CUAC's recommendation to increase the loan interest rate ceiling would not mean that credit unions are required to raise their loan interest rates, rather they could apply their own interest rates within the parameters allowed.  The policy paper is available on my Department's website.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the CUAC Report Implementation Group - a group established to oversee and monitor the implementation of recommendations from the CUAC report - has also considered the issue of the increasing the interest rate cap as recommended in the CUAC policy paper.  This group is chaired by my Department and is made up of one member from each of the credit union representative bodies - the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers&rsquo; Association and the National Supervisors Forum - and a member from the Central Bank.  The Implementation Group is currently in the process of finalising its Final Report which will be published shortly.  Following publication of the Final Report, I will review the Implementation Group's recommendation on the loan interest cap, along with the CUAC recommendation already received, and consider if any legislative changes are required.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I should also note that the CUAC recommendation on the interest rate cap is aligned with a similar recommendation that has been put forward recently in the \"Interest Rate Restrictions on Credit for Low-income Borrowers\" report, compiled by the Centre for Co-operative Studies University College Cork on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF05300"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[50687\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the funding available for loans and credit insurance, respectively, by strategic banking Ireland; the number of applications received since its establishment in respect of each of the categories; the number and value of applications that have been approved; the funding and insurance provided; the timeline for applications to be dealt with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the SBCI.  The SBCI is Ireland&rsquo;s national promotional institution for SMEs.  The SBCI does not provide financing directly to SMEs, rather, it uses an on-lending model and works with both banks and non-bank finance providers to make lower-cost finance available to eligible enterprises. The SBCI currently has 3 bank and 3 non-bank on-lenders. <\/p>  <p>  The strategic mission of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs.  The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing activities, which involve the provision of guarantees.  To date, none of the SBCI&rsquo;s funding has been used to support a specific credit insurance product; rather, as I mentioned, it provides guarantees to and engages in the sharing of risk with its partner finance providers, as well as the State and European partners. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the figures sought by the Deputy, I am advised that the SBCI does not obtain details of the number of applications for loans made to its on-lending partners and does not receive loan applications directly from SMEs, due to its on-lending model. Instead, the SBCI only obtains information from its on-lending partners in respect of the number of loans to SMEs that have been sanctioned. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of March 2018, the total volume of SBCI supported lending activity through eight on-lending partners, including loans made under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee schemes, was &euro;972 million to over 24,000 SMEs supporting 129,300. <\/p>  <p>  The Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme are the SBCI&rsquo;s two major risk-sharing guarantee Schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, which has now concluded, a total of approximately &euro;145 million of loans were drawn down by over 4,200 SMES.  These loans were made available through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. SMEs applied directly to those banks for loan approval and these applications were subject to the banks&rsquo; normal credit assessment processes.<\/p>  <p>  Up to &euro;300 million of funding to SMEs and small MidCaps is currently available under the Brexit Loan Scheme.  There is a two-stage application process for this funding.  First, businesses must apply to the SBCI to confirm their eligibility for the Scheme.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges.  The SBCI has advised me that it deals with these eligibility applications within 24 hours.  Then, loans are subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures. The Scheme is available through the AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. <\/p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Brexit Loan Scheme on 28 March 2018 to 23 November 2018, the SBCI has received 307 applications.  Of these, 270 have been deemed eligible to proceed to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the Scheme.  In total, 54 SMEs have progressed to sanction at partner finance provider level to a total value of &euro;12,510,000.<\/p>  <p>  The SBCI also operates the Credit Guarantee Scheme on behalf of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. In the last two years, loans of &euro;28.7 million have been supported under the Scheme providing funding to 190 SMEs. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises&rdquo; applies to applications made to the SBCI&rsquo;s on-lenders that are regulated entities by the Central Bank of Ireland.  This Code requires the finance providers to set out their timelines for dealing with loan applications, which vary depending on the size of the loan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[50692\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400072#WRF05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year cost of the increases to the standard rate cut off point to &euro;50,000 over the next five years (details supplied).","asker":"1242","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the estimated full year cost of increasing the standard rate cut off point for all income tax bands by &euro;14,700 which would bring it to &euro;50,000 for a single person and &euro;100,000 for a couple in a single year, would be approximately &euro;2.3 billion. <\/p>  <p>  This estimated figure has been generated by the Revenue cost model by reference to projected 2019 incomes, calculated on the basis of actual data for the year 2016, the latest year for which returns are available, and adjusted for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

The recent US tax reform sees that country asserting its global taxing rights and this should put an end to the type of arrangements some multinationals were previously able to use to avoid tax. <\/p>  <p>  We are already seeing evidence of US companies recognising a tax charge and paying tax in the US in respect of historic profits as a result of US tax reform. I believe the changes introduced, combined with the widespread implementation of the BEPS recommendations, will have a major impact on the ability of multinationals to engage in aggressive tax planning. <\/p>  <p>  The amendment in Finance Act 2014 was brought into effect for new companies incorporated after 1 January 2015.  To ensure that this change did not negatively impact on other related group companies who have real and substantial operations in Ireland, a transition period until end 2020 was provided to give these groups a reasonable timeframe to plan and re-organise their business structures to take account of this change. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that, as the so-called &lsquo;double Irish&rsquo; structure is not part of the Irish tax code, Revenue does not have a register of companies incorporated but not tax-resident in Ireland that may be used in that structure. Statistics regarding such companies, which may include companies used in a &lsquo;double Irish&rsquo; structure, are therefore not available. However I would again note that there is evidence that multi-lateral and US tax reform is proving successful in ensuring that profits in such companies are subject to tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400073#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400073#WRG01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Superannuation Schemes","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400073#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[50401\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400073#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of injury warrants paid in the past five years; if there are conditions attached to these injury warrants; the range of conditions that must be met before qualifying for a warrant; the reason injury warrants are refused; and the number of refusals issued in the past five years.","asker":"1248","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>The Civil Service Injury Warrants are a series of statutory instruments made under the Superannuation Acts.

(SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.

These include the end of the First World War, the delicate path we walk to mark the foundation of the State, and the role of women in society.

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2011 was &euro;27,814. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,318 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. <\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.<\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  On Monday 24th September, the Government welcomed the outcome of discussions between public service employers and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. <\/p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants at points 4 and 8 of their scale. <\/p>  <p>  These restorations for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. The Public Service Stability Agreement provides a range of protections and benefits to public servants who are covered by the agreement. If a union opts to withdraw from the agreement, they are choosing to forego these protections and benefits.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, school leadership is again supported with an additional release day for teaching principals in primary schools and a further four additional release days for teaching principals in schools with special classes. These additional release days - 18, 24, and 30 depending on the size of the school - will be effective from 1st September 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets, including &euro;0.4 million made available in Budget 2018 to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This funding provided an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018\/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also introduced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the current school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.<\/p>  <p>  On 26 November, 2018 the Minister for Education and Skills, Joe McHugh T.D., announced that the Minor Works Grant of &euro;29m will be paid to all primary schools throughout the country over the next number of days.  This follows a commitment under Project Ireland 2040 that the Minor Works Grant will be paid on an annual basis to all primary schools.  <\/p>  <p>  All primary schools receive a flat rate Minor Works Grant of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil and &euro;74 per special needs pupil attending a special school or special class. The grant is worth &euro;6,425 for a 50 pupil school and over &euro;11,000 for a 300 pupil school. <\/p>  <p>  While schools have discretion under the Minor Works Grant Scheme in relation to the nature of small scale works and improvements to be carried out to their school buildings, the Department advised all school authorities to use the grant in the first instance to prioritise fire safety prevention works.   <\/p>  <p>  While Budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small schools (i.e., schools with up to four classroom teachers), the staffing ratios of these schools have been improved since 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2015, improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher were introduced, along with the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and\/or language of instruction.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2016 announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule with this improvement implemented in the 2016\/17 school year. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools. Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  <\/p>  <p>  Improvements to the staffing schedule announced in Budget 2018 brings the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the most favourable level ever seen at primary level and these improvements were introduced in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including small schools that were affected by the Budget 2012 changes, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some primary schools are experiencing difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers. <\/p>  <p>  I recently published the teacher supply action plan, which contains actions under a number of headings: data collection and analysis; promotion of the teaching profession; initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher supply.

Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.<\/p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:<\/p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and<\/p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.<\/p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. <\/p><p>Accordingly, the legal requirement for local authorities to act as data controller for the purpose of community CCTV schemes has been in place since 2006.  The Deputy may further wish to be aware that under the 2005 Act, as amended, the relevant secondary legislation is not a matter for me as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Rather, the power to establish the criteria for community CCTV schemes is a matter for the Policing Authority, by order made with the approval of the Government. <\/p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November this year the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office issued a note (available on its website <i>www.dataprotection.ie<\/i>) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Office in its note confirmed that: &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In relation to the question of monitoring, as raised by the Deputy, the Data Protection Commission has explicitly confirmed that local authorities are not required, as a result of their role as data controller, to monitor CCTV live feeds on a continuous basis. <\/p><p>The Data Protection Commission is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies forlaw enforcement purposes.  We expect the findings from the CCTV module of this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. <\/p><p>My Department is also engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.<\/p><p>Finally, in relation to the question of funding: my Department does not provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake their legal responsibilities as data controllers. Local Authorities expenditure is funded from a variety of sources.<\/p><p>However the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department.  In total, funding of &euro;1 million is available each year for three years.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.<\/p><p>Funding provided by my Department under this grant aid scheme has been aimed at the capital cost of establishing community CCTV schemes which meet the statutory requirements.  Local authorities are not prohibited from applying for these grants and indeed a number of local authorities have been approved for funding under the current scheme. <\/p><p>There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved for grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further 4 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.<\/p><p>I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme. If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie<\/i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address <i>communitycctv@justice.ie<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400075#WRJ05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Equality","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400075#WRJ06100"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[50762\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400075#WRJ06200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps that have been taken or are planned to improve gender equality in the workplace, in particular steps covering more than just pay inequality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1275","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>Various commitments have been made in the Programme for a Partnership Government with a view to empowering women in the area of employment.

In the end, requests for amounts totalling &euro;125,000 (out of the &euro;150,000 available) were received from Muintir na T&iacute;re and paid out to 441 groups in respect of the full year 2017. <\/p>  <p>  A payment of between &euro;200-&euro;350 was made to each group in 2017 to offset the costs incurred by these local groups, where this spend could be supported with documentation.

The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians. This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect, with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians, where necessary. <\/p>  <p>  Progress is being made in relation to civilianisation. Since the beginning of 2017 approximately 330 new civilian posts have been sanctioned by the Policing Authority with the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The bulk of these were to address critical skills gaps and capacity issues with a proportion sanctioned to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 3 December, approximately 365 civilians have been recruited to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018.  Some of these civilian staff were recruited to backfill existing vacancies, some were to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline duties and others were to fill newly created civilian posts to fill skills gaps across the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  Work is also continuing on an overall redeployment plan and I am informed by Garda management that as of 3 December, almost 200 Garda&iacute; have been reassigned to operational duties and it is expected that the target for 2018 of 250 redeployments will be achieved by year end.  That is an additional 250 Garda&iacute; on the front-line in 2018 over and above those being recruited under the Government's accelerated recruitment programme.  Now that redeployments are happening, I expect that the momentum will increase and that 2019 will see greater numbers of sworn members moving from administrative work to the front-line. <\/p>  <p>  This is very much in line with the Report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland which recommends the return of Garda&iacute; to the front line to deliver visible policing.  Later this month, I will bring my substantive response to the Report and a High Level Implementation Plan to Government, for approval.  The twin issues of redeployment and  civilianisation will be prioritised in the High Level Implementation Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Third Interim Report of the Disclosures Tribunal suggested a series of obligations as the duty of police personnel.

Neither may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.<\/p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:<\/p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and<\/p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.<\/p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.<\/p><p>There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further 4 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the location of the CCTV schemes which have been approved for funding to date is as follows:<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>No. of Approved Schemes<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Deputy enquired in relation to the role of local authorities.  As set out above, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006, any proposed community CCTV scheme must have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller. <\/p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November this year the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office issued a note (available on its website <i>www.dataprotection.ie<\/i>) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Data Protection Commission confirmed that: &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The Data Protection Commissioner's Office is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies for law enforcement purposes.  We expect the findings from the CCTV module of this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. <\/p><p>My Department is also engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.<\/p><p>This is the case as I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of the grant aid scheme.  If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie<\/i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address <i>communitycctv@justice.ie.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400077#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gambling Legislation","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400077#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[50882\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400077#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the Gambling Control Bill 2018 review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":627,"content":"<p>I note this question relates to the current review of the General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill 2013.

That is why significant resources have been invested into this area, including through the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan which includes financing measures, new construction and rental sector improvements.  These steps will, first and foremost, ensure that people in Ireland are better able to buy and rent suitable homes.  They will also serve to reinforce our national infrastructure in terms of its capacity to accommodate further foreign direct investment.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, it is important to bear in mind that international investors take a long-term view on where they choose to establish a presence. Investors also use a wide range of criteria to inform such decisions.  Our traditional strengths are well known &ndash; including our talented workforce, membership of the EU and pro-enterprise policy environment &ndash; and these critical factors continue, as the healthy pipeline of investment here demonstrates, to make the country an attractive proposition to overseas firms. <\/p>  <p>  We should not forget either that many of the States that we compete with for investment have challenges of their own &ndash; including in housing &ndash; when it comes to attracting overseas firms.  So while we have infrastructural areas in this country that need further investment and improvement, we are not alone in facing that challenge. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is fully seized of current housing market conditions in Ireland and recognises that this is an important issue for investors.  The Agency&rsquo;s assessments of the housing market are based on a wide range of sources and a combination of indices, with the aim of forming the clearest possible picture of how Irish rents compare internationally.  These information sources are continuously reviewed and contribute to briefings used by IDA staff.  It should be remembered too that the overseas firms that the IDA targets to invest in Ireland &ndash; many of whom are large multinational companies with an existing presence here &ndash; form their own opinions on housing supply and other investment conditions here. <\/p>  <p>  The media piece in question refers to IDA briefing documents that highlight a number of indices regarding the Irish property market.  They include a 2018 Residential Tenancies Board figure on average rents in Dublin City.  Another index, which was sourced from the Nestpick 2017 Furnished Apartment Index, set out an estimate of the costs of renting small furnished apartments across County Dublin in 2017.

I am confident that the agencies under my remit have the supports available to enable companies to consolidate existing market share and build resilience by broadening their exports to other international markets.   <\/p>  <p>  Since the outcome of the 2016 referendum in the UK, my Department has been preparing for Brexit.  In 2017 for example, we outlined our approach to Brexit in the Report entitled &ldquo;Building Stronger Business&rdquo; which identified the anticipated impacts of Brexit on the enterprise sector.  Since then, my Department with its agencies has continued to work on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning, putting in place a range of supports to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by Brexit.  Our Enterprise Agencies are at the forefront of these efforts. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland, an agency of my Department, continues to focus on converting interest shown from companies into investing in Ireland in key sectors including financial services, bio-pharma, technology and business services.  It is making steady progress winning investments and is confident that we will see more Brexit related investments. <\/p>  <p>  As highlighted in a Copenhagen Economics study commissioned by my Department and published earlier this year, limited opportunities from Brexit may arise, mainly concentrated in the financial services sector and some other business services.  Financial Services is a key sector where Ireland has considerable strengths.  IDA Ireland is taking a targeted but realistic approach to pursuing these opportunities and this is being done in the context of upholding regulatory standards that apply in Ireland managed by the Central Bank.  IDA Ireland estimate that more than 40 companies have decided to either expand their existing operations or establish their first presence in Ireland as a consequence of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has an extensive range of supports to encourage clients to become more competitive, innovative and to diversify export markets and have put in place a suite of supports to assist companies.  These include initiatives such as the Brexit scorecard to help companies assess their Brexit exposure, a Be Prepared grant of up to &euro;5,000 to prepare a Brexit action plan, dedicated Brexit Advisory clinics organized countrywide and a Short Term loan facility of &euro;300m.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules aimed on further developing in-market expertise and networks, new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns.  These efforts are underpinned by the Eurozone Strategy launched by EI in 2017 to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Key to my Department's response to Brexit has been extensive consultation with stakeholders across all sectors of the economy.  Detailed research has been carried out to help the Government decide how to best respond to the challenges of Brexit.  Several important steps have already been taken to prepare our economy, including through a range of measures aimed at building resilience and providing new opportunities to business announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, in Budget 2019, we have introduced additional measures to assist businesses, complimenting existing Brexit supports.  These include the Future Growth Loan Scheme to provide longer-term lending to support capital investment by businesses; an additional &euro;5 million to the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to enhance the programme of supports which they provided at local level, including training in customs procedures for businesses; an additional &euro;8 million for the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies in their efforts to support businesses; an extra &euro;1 million in capital funding to InterTradeIreland to assist companies trading on an all Island basis and, a doubling of the Retail Online Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25 million to assist companies to build an online presence.    <\/p>  <p>  This Government is also focused on sustaining and creating new employment opportunities.  Building on the success of the Action Plan for Jobs, the recently launched Future Jobs programme represents the next phase of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.  The Future Jobs strategy sets out longer-term ambitions for the future of the economy, taking account of the challenges facing us, including Brexit.  We want the economy to sustainably grow in the years ahead and embrace new technologies.  It is designed to secure our enterprise base and secure Ireland&rsquo;s long-term economic prosperity.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that across a range of supports and initiatives, work of my Department and its agencies is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[50843\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to maximise business and innovation opportunities to enhance job creation through innovation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[50844\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to support business through innovation and maximisation of opportunities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 283 together.<\/p><p>My Department recognises that innovation is key to maintaining competitiveness for Ireland in global markets, and for providing jobs and sustaining growth across the whole of the economy, as well as embedding the foreign direct investment base in Ireland.  <\/p><p>In 2018, Ireland rose to 9th place in the European Innovation Scorecard.  We also retained our position in the Global Innovation Index, ranking 10th out of 126 countries.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, Innovation 2020, articulates Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to become a Global Innovation Leader, identifying priority themes, which have been revised to reflect the impact of technological change and digitisation.<\/p><p>A report published by my Department in October 2018,<i>&lsquo;<\/i>The Research and Development Budget (R&amp;amp;D) 2017 &ndash; 2018&rsquo; presents the latest available data on the Government Research and Development (R&amp;amp;D) Budget and on Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;amp;D expenditure across all sectors.  <\/p><p>It reports that Government Budget Allocations for R&amp;amp;D (GBARD) in 2017 was &euro;739.3m, an increase of 2.8% in expenditure over the previous year.  It also reports that a total of 36,087 personnel (full-time equivalents) were working in R&amp;amp;D in 2016.  Of these, 18,203 were working in the business sector, 1,891 in the higher education sector and 933 in the Government sector.<\/p><p>My Department, through its agencies Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Enterprise Ireland (EI) and IDA Ireland supports both business and higher education sectors RDI activities.  My Department is also making significant investments to develop the national ecosystem of research and technology centres.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic growth and prosperity depends on maintaining and indeed increasing investment across the broad science, technology and innovation spectrum.<\/p><p>My commitment to continuing support for innovation can be evidenced by the increase in my Department&rsquo;s 2019 innovation budget to &euro;368.95m &ndash; an increase of &euro;40.25m over 2018.  This will be spent over a range of initiatives and programmes that advance innovation and facilitate opportunities for Irish interests on EU and world markets.  SFI and EI R&amp;amp;D programmes account for over 80% of my Department&rsquo;s innovation budget.  SFI and EI will continue to leverage EU and private sector funding for research programmes, building on successes to date.<\/p><p>A specific innovation programme is Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), managed by EI, which enables public sector bodies to connect with innovative ideas and technology businesses, to provide innovative solutions for specific public-sector challenges and needs.  10 SBIR challenges have issued in 2018 with a further HSE suite of challenges expected before year end.<\/p><p>Of particular innovative relevance in the 2019 budget is the allocation of &euro;20m for Phase I of the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, which has a total fund of &euro;500m as set out in Project Ireland 2040.  This fund is about exploiting research to deliver new technologies and new solutions.  It will incentivise collaborations between companies, colleges and other public-sector bodies to deploy disruptive technology in Ireland, in ways that will create entirely new companies and even new sectors in due course.<\/p><p>The budget also includes an additional &euro;10m in 2019 as part of a &euro;100m dedicated PhD\/Masters training programme through SFI in areas aligned to enterprise needs. An additional &euro;5m in 2019 is specifically allocated for the renewal of six of SFI&rsquo;s world-leading research centres.  SFI engage in excellent research with industry and to date this has resulted in over 600 contracts with industry, &euro;150m of industry co-funding and &euro;170m of competitively won funding from Europe. <\/p><p>There is also assistance available from the European Union.  Horizon 2020 is the instrument that supports collaborative R&amp;amp;D in Europe.  Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovation capability and competitiveness, which in turn, will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation and increases in sales and exports.  My agencies provide support to their client companies in this application process.  Ireland has secured over &euro;630m research funding through the current Horizon 2020 programme and remains on course to achieve its ambitious target of &euro;1.25b in research funding by the conclusion of the programme.  <\/p><p>However, notwithstanding all these innovation supports, more needs to be done.  Technological change is already impacting several sectors, such as manufacturing, finance, retail and transport.  These changes will present both challenges and new opportunities - certain job roles will disappear or be redefined and brand-new job roles will appear requiring new and different skillsets.  Technological innovation is radically transforming our lives, and this will continue.<\/p><p>I am aware that we need to work now to position Ireland to prepare for and respond to these changes.  For Ireland to be at the frontier of technological developments we must both encourage and facilitate innovation across sectors and firms - by increasing investment in RD&amp;amp;I and promoting strong links between enterprise and the research community, both nationally and internationally. <\/p><p>To this end, my Department, along with the Department of the Taoiseach, is currently developing the Future Jobs Initiative, a new cross-Government strategy to guide the next phase of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.  The focus is on quality jobs, improving productivity and building a resilient and innovative economy.  Innovation and technological change is one of the five key pillars and this focus will have a positive impact on the innovation ecosystem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":695,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[50845\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM03800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she continues to encourage enterprise with a view to even greater job creation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":696,"content":"<p>Driving more enterprise creation by supporting the indigenous sector is a key focus of mine and I am working closely with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) and with Enterprise Ireland (EI) to achieve this.

A key objective of the initiative is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of having the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average.<\/p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period.  That is over 63% - or 3 out of every 5 jobs created &ndash; were for regions outside of Co. Dublin (Q1 2015 &ndash; Q3 2018).  In the year from Q3 2017 &ndash; Q3 2018, just over half (51%) of the jobs created were outside of Co. Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  In April of this year, I asked all the RAPJ committees and other regional stakeholders to start a process to Refresh and Refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020.  The Refresh and Refocus will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country and can be robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  All Regions have established a Project Delivery Team, which has met to examine initial proposals for each Region&rsquo;s Strategic Objectives and all Regions now have a working draft of their refreshed Plans.

I am especially pleased to see that of the 237 overseas investments made in 2017, a record number of 111 were from new companies investing in Ireland for the first time.  This reflects the health of the pipeline of foreign direct investment (FDI) here.  <\/p>  <p>  The Agency has maintained &ndash; if not bettered &ndash; its strong performance from 2017 into 2018.  Regions outside of Dublin have had some high-profile job announcements including 600 jobs in the Mid-West at Edwards Life Sciences and 400 new jobs promised for Dundalk by Chinese life sciences company Wuxi Biologics.  There were also two significant announcements in Longford in Avery Dennison and Red Seal Sups, bringing 300 jobs to the Midlands region. <\/p>  <p>  The global investment climate, we should remember, is becoming ever more competitive.  Our collective ability to continue winning new overseas investment for Ireland is therefore a testament to both the work of the IDA and the strength of our offering to multinational companies. <\/p>  <p>Enterprise Ireland supports approximately 5,000 companies and a total of 209,338 people are now employed in those companies.  Despite the challenges and uncertainty created by Brexit, there are also many opportunities and Irish companies have continued to win sales around the world that have supported strong job creation across all regions of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  19,332 new jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland backed companies in 2017, with 64% of these jobs created in regions outside of Dublin.  There was employment growth in every sector and every county.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice, guidance, financial assistance and soft supports such as training and mentoring to those wishing to start or grow their own business. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the LEOs supported 7,182 client companies employing 37,485 people.  They created 7,135 new jobs with a net increase of 3,760 jobs.  The LEOs provided mentoring to 8,393 clients in 2017 and 30,373 people took part in training provided by the LEOs.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also supports InterTrade Ireland (ITI), the cross-border trade and business development body.  Funding for ITI is jointly provided by my Department and our Northern Ireland counterpart, the Department for the Economy.  Through its innovation and trade initiatives, ITI helps small businesses in Ireland and Northern Ireland to explore new cross-border markets and develop new products, processes and services which help improve capability as well as driving competitiveness, growth and jobs.  With the launch of the Brexit Advisory Service in May 2017, InterTrade Ireland is also helping companies to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU through a range of supports and services.  ITI is a small organisation but with a big outreach; to date, the body has assisted over 39,000 companies, created or protected over 14,000 jobs and supported over &euro;1.2bn in additional business development value for small businesses across the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":701,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[50847\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans for the maximisation of job creation opportunities throughout the regions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":702,"content":"<p>Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made jobs and enterprise in the regions my top priority.<\/p>  <p>  We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.<\/p>  <p>  Strategic investments within the overarching national context (Project Ireland 2040), and actions focused on maximising the competitive advantages and potential of each of the regions are key to ensuring each region can contribute to, and participate in Ireland&rsquo;s future national growth, and sustain a higher standard of living.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published Q3 2018 CSO Labour Force Survey employment figures are overall very positive.

In 2017, for example, 45% of all jobs created were based outside of Dublin.  The Agency is working hard to increase that percentage further.<\/p>  <p>  I know the IDA and its staff are working, on a daily basis, to secure new investment and jobs for regional areas.  It is encouraging to note, for example, that in the first three quarters of 2018 there were 461 site visits and over half of these visits were to regional locations.  This helps show the ongoing efforts being made by the Agency to showcase regional sites to prospective investors. <\/p>  <p>  However, we must remember that the ultimate decision as to where to invest is always taken by the company itself.  I understand the focus placed on site visits and it is the case that they represent a useful tool by which the merits of regional locations can be showcased to investors.  At the same time, it must be borne in mind that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 also saw the Agency allocated an additional &euro;10m for the Regional Property Programme (RPP).  This will help ensure that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging more FDI to the regions.  The IDA plans to develop new buildings in regional locations including Carlow, Dundalk, Monaghan, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.<\/p>  <p>  19,332 new jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland backed companies in 2017, with 64% of these jobs created in regions outside of Dublin.  There was employment growth in every sector and every county. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, I allocated an extra &euro;8m to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, who work with firms at the coalface to develop their supports for business.  I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland to enhance our Global Footprint.  This will help companies to diversify into new markets as the UK leaves the EU.  &euro;2.75m will also be allocated to Enterprise Ireland to fund a support programme of Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters.<\/p>  <p>  I have also allocated &euro;1.8m to the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland over 3 years to expand marketing and development programmes to support Irish designers and makers to exhibit at international trade fairs, to develop partnerships with flagship retailers, and to develop e-commerce capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice, and guidance, financial assistance and soft supports such as training and mentoring to those wishing to start or grow their own business. <\/p>  <p>  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs have been allocated an additional &euro;5m for 2019 and this will allow them to focus resources on specific platforms: Building Locally &ndash; a proposal to establish a competitive fund to support high quality proposals in that context; Sustaining and Growing Existing Microenterprises &ndash; an additional resource with a focus on key clients with growth potential or in need of devising a plan to counteract the impacts of Brexit; Brexit and Customs implications\/impacts - training and awareness programmes to support firms throughout the country, in all regions, in the area of both Import and Export customs implications and procedures.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also supports InterTradeIreland (ITI), the cross-border trade and business development body. Funding for ITI is jointly provided by DBEI and our Northern Ireland counterpart, the Department for the Economy.  Through its innovation and trade initiatives, ITI helps small businesses in Ireland and Northern Ireland to explore new cross-border markets and develop new products, processes and services which help improve capability as well as driving competitiveness, growth and jobs.  With the launch of the Brexit Advisory Service in May 2017, InterTradeIreland is also helping companies to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU through a range of supports and services.  ITI is a small organisation but with a big outreach; to date, the body has assisted over 39,000 companies, created or protected over 14,000 jobs and supported over &euro;1.2bn in additional business development value for small businesses across the island. <\/p>  <p>  To support this important work, my Department will provide an additional &euro;1 million in capital funding to ITI in 2019.  This funding will enable the body to engage with more of the companies that are seeking its support through the Brexit Advisory Service, as well as meeting demand for existing programmes which are all designed to promote and support cross-border trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exports Growth","counter":706,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM04900"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[50850\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she remains satisfied that Irish products on world markets remain sufficiently attractive in view of the various international challenges; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[50851\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to encourage and expand markets for Irish goods overseas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 289 together.<\/p>  <p>  Competitiveness is key to success in international markets, to job growth and as a means of achieving sustainable improvements in living standards. Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus for Government, and as part of this work my Department, its agencies and the National Competitiveness Council are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to strengthen our international competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  In its 2017 Competitiveness Challenge Report, the Council has identified a range of threats to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, including the potential impact of Brexit, the concentration of our export markets and the range of products and services exported.<\/p>  <p>  At firm level, Enterprise Ireland (EI) actively supports firms to develop new products and services for new and existing markets.  EI&rsquo;s Strategy 2017-20 &ldquo;Build Scale-Expand Reach&rdquo; looks to increase the reach of its client company exports, with two-thirds of exports going beyond the UK.  To broaden the export footprint across the globe, the EI Strategy focuses on training and supports to enhance management capability, leadership and productivity, marketing\/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D, access to funding to help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Sustaining and growing jobs and diversifying the export base is a challenge when aligned with the key objective of reducing the overall dependence on the UK market as a percentage of overall exports.  Therefore, my Department has allocated additional funding in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to enable EI achieve its objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Extra staff has been placed in EI&rsquo;s overseas offices with sectoral knowledge and expertise such as in engineering, food, life sciences and construction. Also, in Budget 2019 I allocated an extra &euro;3 million to EI to help it to diversify our Global Footprint.  This will drive export growth to international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK. <\/p>  <p>  There is now a major focus on directing resources and expertise to the Eurozone markets where EI sees opportunities, targeting a 50% increase in exports by 2020.  A new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; communications campaign is targeting Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.<\/p>  <p>  There are also significant opportunities in various other international markets for quality Irish goods and services.  The future relative importance and forecasted growth rates of China, India, the South-East Asian countries, the Gulf States, Latin America and Africa combined with the scale of these markets means we will support Irish companies to continue to work to build exports in these markets.  In January of this year, EI launched its new Market Discovery Fund to help more Irish companies accelerate their market diversification efforts.<\/p>  <p>  A more diverse export base can reduce exposure to external demand shocks, exchange rate fluctuations and instability in export earnings and enhance growth and jobs.  I will continue to work with my Department and EI to ensure Irish-based exporters, particularly in exposed sectors such as traditional manufacturing and agri-food, will continue to be supported to scale and diversify sustainably and strategically. <\/p>  <p>  Innovation remains at the forefront of any business to ensure that they grow and expand to ensure they are at a level to compete on the EU and global markets effectively.  Innovation involves helping companies improve competitiveness by developing new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.  Innovation is an essential component in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in overseas markets.  EI has a suite of supports available to assist client companies innovate and develop their enterprise.  These supports help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable export growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Balance","counter":710,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05400"},{"type":"question","counter":711,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[50852\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which enterprise led by women continues to be supported by her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":712,"content":"<p>I am determined to see the numbers of businesses in Ireland led by women grow and for supports to continue to be delivered to businesswomen throughout Ireland.  The deputy can be assured that my Department has a strong focus on the provision of supports and programmes to assist women to lead businesses, whether they are established businesses or new businesses. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has to lead by example.  Through a concerted effort throughout departments and agencies, the participation by women on State boards has increased over the last few years to 41 per cent. Unfortunately, female representation on corporate boards is lagging far behind. Women currently make up just 18.1 percent of directors of Irish-registered ISEQ20 companies, which is significantly lower than the EU average of 26.2 percent for large publicly-listed companies.<\/p>  <p>  That is why the Better Balance for Better Business initiative was launched at an event in Government Buildings in July of this year.  The Government has brought together a team of expert leaders to examine and make recommendations as to why there are so few women in senior executive positions and at board level in Irish companies.  The review group will examine the gender mix at the governance and senior management levels in companies, as well as the issues that arise in connection with the appointment of directors and senior management.  Dr Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General of my Department, is one of the leaders on this group alongside Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland and Julie Sinnamon, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland.  The Better Balance for Better Business group will report back with actions for Government and business to increase the percentage of women on corporate boards and in senior management in leading Irish companies.  It will engage with companies to make the case for change and will report annually on its progress.<\/p>  <p>  Another method to encourage more businesses in Ireland to be led by women is to have businesses start with women at the helm. The 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Ireland data suggest a persistent gender divide in Ireland in the business startup rate in Ireland.  A gender divide is evident in most countries. GEM Ireland data suggests that if the rate of new business owners in Ireland for women was at the rate for men, an extra 8,000 women would have started a business in 2017. So clearly, we have an under-utilised resource, which is contributing and can contribute further to Ireland reaching its economic potential. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is leading the way in providing a variety of programmes through its agencies to increase the number of women starting businesses and assisting them at every stage, from potential business leaders to women growing their businesses.  My Department published the first National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement in 2014. Action 19 of the policy statement is to promote female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models, targeted events and awards, support for female entrepreneur networks and promotion of a dedicated area on corporate websites. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been at the forefront of examining the variance in the female to male ratio of start-ups and have put in place measures to address the imbalance.  The Competitive Start Fund (CSF) for Female Entrepreneurs aims to support early stage start-ups.  This programme is specifically for Female Entrepreneurs or female-led start-ups, active in the Manufacturing &amp;amp; Internationally Traded Services sectors including the following subsectors: Internet, Games, Apps, Mobile, SaaS, Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software, Lifesciences, Food, Cleantech and Industrial Products.  The establishment of this programme has resulted in a spill-over effect with increased female participation in other EI programmes.  In 2017, 42 of the 96 businesses in all CSFs were female led.  In 2012, just eight percent of the 97 High-Potential Start Ups (HPSUs) were female-led.  However, in 2017, 28 percent of the total 90 HPSUs were female led.<\/p>  <p>  As role modelling is particularly important to aspiring female businesswomen, Enterprise Ireland sponsors several key events: <\/p>  <p>  - Image Business Woman of the Year Awards,<\/p>  <p>  - Tatler Business Woman of the Year Awards and Conference, <\/p>  <p>  - Network Ireland Awards and Conference, and<\/p>  <p>  - Inspirefest, Silicon Republic.      <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and Network Ireland have run &lsquo;Fuelling Ambition&rsquo; roadshows across Ireland. &lsquo;Lead and Succeed&rsquo; was the theme of this year&rsquo;s roadshow which aims to encourage, support and drive the ambition of female entrepreneurs nationally by showcasing thriving Irish business women and entrepreneurs.  The roadshow incorporated an Elevator Pitch competition and locations visited included Waterford, Kilkenny, Roscommon and Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also partners with key providers in providing training and capability development for early stage and establishes entrepreneurs.  It developed a series of female accelerator programmes in partnership with knowledge providers.  These included: <\/p>  <p>  - Going for Growth with Paula Fitzsimons,  <\/p>  <p>  - DCU Ryan Academy Female Propeller Programme,<\/p>  <p>  - NDRC Female Founders Programme, and<\/p>  <p>  - CIT Female Exxcel Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks.  An important aspect of the networking programme is the promotion of successful female entrepreneurs as role models and the use of mentoring and networking opportunities which aims to build confidence of newly emerging female entrepreneurs and women operating established businesses.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen progress in the numbers of women availing of many of the Services provided by the LEOs.  For example, in 2017, 57% of participants attending core training programme, such as Start Your Own Business, were female.<\/p>  <p>  From these actions and supports, it is evident that my Department has a strong focus on supporting female led enterprises.  I want to see the numbers of these businesses increase for the betterment of the business environment and for society in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Knowledge Development Box","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05700"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[50853\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which the knowledge development box continues to be an asset in securing investment in jobs here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>Both Enterprise 2025 - Ireland's National Enterprise Policy, and Innovation 2020 - Ireland's national strategy for research and development, science and technology emphasise that increasing our people's standard of living requires Ireland to have a strong, innovative and internationally competitive enterprise base which grows employment, sales and exports.  A key factor in achieving this is to ensure we have a coherent innovation ecosystem which is responsive to emerging opportunities and leads to the creation and application of knowledge.  An internationally competitive research system that acts as a magnet and catalyst for talent and industry will also help the development of a world renowned pool of talent in Ireland&rsquo;s public research system and in industry. In the context of an intensely competitive international environment, this helps Ireland remain attractive to investment from both domestic and foreign owned growth businesses. <\/p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box (KDB), introduced in Budget 2016 forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering to continue to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and to support Irish owned companies to innovate and to compete effectively on international markets.  The relief was adapted by the introduction of a new certification scheme via the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Act 2017, which eases the qualification process for smaller companies.<\/p>  <p>  The KDB provides an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax on profits from certain qualifying assets that are earned by a company, chargeable to corporation tax in the State, to the extent that the assets relate to Research and Development (R&amp;D) undertaken by that company.

These include R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres \/ knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding.  Taken together, these provide a competitive proposition for business investment. <\/p>  <p>  As a key part of Ireland's competitive offering as a location of choice from which to do business, the KDB has helped secure investment since its introduction in 2016 and continues to stimulate further investment in R&amp;D activities by both Irish and foreign owned enterprises resulting in a more resilient and sustainable economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM06000"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[50858\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400078#WRM06100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the additional jobs added in the 12 months to the third quarter of 2018 in counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath from the latest labour force survey.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":718,"content":"<p>The data requested by the Deputy is collected by the Central Statistics Office, which is under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p><p>In this regard the Department of an Taoiseach have informed me that the exact information requested by the Deputy is not available. <\/p><p>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the official source of estimates of employment in the State.

This is a result both of out-of-cycle smears and increased uptake generally. This has impacted turnaround times for results of smear tests. Between May and October this year and when compared to the same period in the previous year, CervicalCheck recorded an increase of over 75,000 smear tests being carried out. <\/p>  <p>  This has led to a backlog in the laboratories that carry out the analysis of each smear sample slide. It is unfortunate and regrettable that results are currently being reported on average around 20 weeks of the test being taken. In a small number of cases this may take longer. The HSE has apologised to patients affected and are doing everything possible to improve this situation as a priority. <\/p>  <p>  Smear test samples must be sent to the laboratory and transferred onto slides within six weeks of the smear test date.  After six weeks, the sample is deemed expired and cannot be processed. There is no requirement for cytology to be undertaken within a certain amount of time, once the sample has been transferred to a slide.The HSE has advised that the majority of smear test samples are now transferred to slides within the six week timeframe. By way of comparison, from April to October 2018 the rate of expired samples and vials was 0.29%. This compares with 0.25% for the same period in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  There may be a small number of cases where the vial used to contain the sample expires before the laboratory has an opportunity to carry out the analysis of the sample and in some cases a sample may be insufficient. Although every effort is made to avoid these situations from happening, it is inevitable that cervical screening programmes will sometimes encounter these issues. In such cases, a woman and her GP are advised, by letter from CervicalCheck, of the need for a repeat test three months after the previous test. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400082#WRQ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":949,"content":"<p>Question No. 379 answered with Question No. 377.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":950,"content":"<p>Question No. 380 answered with Question No. 378.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":952,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[50470\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400082#WRQ05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated wait time for the result of a smear test for a person (details supplied).

The goal is to develop a contractual framework that has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion, disease prevention and for the structured care of chronic conditions, enabling general practitioners to better meet the needs of patients.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and HSE recommenced engagement with the Irish Medical Organisation in early October on a package of measures comprising service improvements and contractual modernisation and reform.  In line with the long-established approach to such processes, and by agreement of the parties concerned, I am not in a position to give further details at this stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400083#WRR05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services Provision","counter":1009,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400083#WRR05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1010,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[50651\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400083#WRR05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if new abortion services will be rolled out in terms of operational access in view of the existing access issues in the health service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1275","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1011,"content":"<p>I have referred this question to the HSE as it is a service matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400083#WRR05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oireachtas Joint Committee Recommendations","counter":1012,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400083#WRR05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1013,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[50652\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400083#WRR06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to develop a new framework of free birth control and more effective sexual health relationship education; if this framework will be put in place as part of the roll out of new abortion services in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1275","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1014,"content":"<p>The Minister established a group, under the chairmanship of the Chief Medical Officer, to consider the issues raised by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution in their ancillary recommendations, including access to contraception.

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the community drugs schemes, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are three indications for the treatment of multiple sclerosis going through the reimbursement process. All had applications made in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE completed a health technology assessment on 29 August 2018 for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). They recommended that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. <\/p>  <p>  On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed their assessment for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) be reimbursed for this indication.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is the statutory decision-making body for medicine reimbursement. It will make the final decision on whether Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) will be reimbursed for each of these indications, taking into consideration the statutory criteria in the 2013 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has also commissioned a HTA of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\/Cannabidiol, THC\/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS) who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy. A full pharmacoeconomic assessment is currently underway by the NCPE. <\/p>  <p>  The challenge of securing affordable access to innovate medicines is not unique to Ireland.  Over the past two years, I and officials have been engaging with a number of voluntary EU forums including the Roundtable meetings with EU Health Ministers and the pharmaceutical industry, High Level Pharmaceutical Policy Meetings and the Valletta Technical Committee in  an effort to identifying solutions to issues of medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.<\/p>  <p>  On the 22 June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy to work with Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with  other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for  patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p>  <p>  The Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy will have an important role to play in securing faster access to innovative medicines and provide important platforms in which to strengthen the policy mix and deliver on the shared objective of securing access to high cost, innovative treatments at affordable prices. The patient is at the centre of this collaborative international approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Data","counter":1101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1102,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[50856\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status and breakdown of services offered at Summerhill primary health facility; and the projected opening date of same","asker":"1291","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1103,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of healthcare infrastructure projects and healthcare services, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Diseases","counter":1104,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1105,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[50857\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address the concerns raised by persons with Lyme disease in terms of diagnosis, patient services and general care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1106,"content":"<p>Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called <i>Borrelia burgdorferi<\/i>. The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. Lyme Disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe. Lyme disease was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The notifiable entity is the more severe neurological form of Lyme disease: Lyme neuroborreliosis. The best protection against Lyme disease is to prevent tick bites when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October.  <\/p><p>Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination. The infection is confirmed by a standard two-staged set of blood tests. A 2016 survey reported that all laboratories offering this testing in Ireland are appropriately accredited and are testing in accordance with best international practice.  Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination which may be carried out by a General Practitioner.  <\/p><p>Lyme disease may be treated by infectious disease specialists or by general internal medicine available in all acute hospitals.  Medical training programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level in Ireland provides specialist training in infectious diseases, including Lyme disease. Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  <\/p><p>The Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland (IDSI) has recently expressed concern that the use of tests that are not validated as clinical diagnostic tests to diagnose Lyme infection can result in the over-diagnosis of Lyme disease and often of other infections.  IDSI is particularly concerned that vulnerable individuals with non-specific, chronic symptoms are being encouraged to access non-accredited diagnostics related to tick-borne infections offered by commercial laboratories overseas, often at considerable personal expense. Use of such unvalidated, exploratory diagnostics can result in public misinformation, undue anxiety to individuals and their families, and unnecessary personal financial burden. Additionally, in the worst cases, there is the potential for misdirected referral, inappropriate treatment and missed opportunities for formal medical assessment to out-rule significant alternative pathology as explanation for the chronic symptoms. These are concerns that I, as Minister, share.<\/p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have cautioned physicians of the serious risks associated with inappropriate prolonged intravenous antibiotics for what is described as &lsquo;chronic Lyme disease&rsquo;, stating:<\/p><p>&ldquo;<i>Patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease have been prescribed various treatments for which there is often <\/i><b><i>no evidence of effectiveness<\/i><\/b><i>, including extended courses of antibiotics (lasting months to years)........ At least five randomized, placebo-controlled studies have shown that prolonged courses of IV antibiotics in particular do not substantially improve long-term outcome for patients with a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease and can result in serious harm, including death&rdquo;<\/i>.<\/p><p>The IDSI endorses the Infectious Diseases Society of America Treatment Guidelines. It has been argued by various parties that there are two sets of US guidelines for the treatment of Lyme and that it is reasonable for a physician to choose either: those of the IDSA or those of ILADS (International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society). However, an independent review of the ILADS guidelines, instigated by the Chief Executive of the Health Protection Agency, UK and chaired by Professor Brian Duerden CBE, Inspector of Microbiology and Infection Control, Department of Health, England found that they are poorly constructed and do not provide a scientifically sound evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and care of patients with Lyme Borreliosis. This independent review also concluded that:<\/p><p><i>- &ldquo;There is potential for harm from use of ILADS guidelines. Patients with other serious conditions who receive a misdiagnosis of Lyme through ILADS guideline risk losing opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of their illness.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- Patients receiving prolonged antibiotic treatment are at risk of organ damage from adverse effects of the drugs as well as risk of secondary infections such as Clostridium difficile enterocolitis, multi-resistant Gram&ndash;positive or Gram-negative bacterial infections and fungal infections. Patients receiving prolonged treatment with parenteral antibiotics have additional infection-related and other risks associated with long-term intravascular access devices.<\/i><\/p><p><i>Other potential harms to patients associated with misdiagnosis include psychological damage through fixation on an unsubstantiated diagnosis of Lyme disease and financial hardship from recommendations and provision of repeated and prolonged courses of oral or parenteral antibiotics&rdquo;.<\/i><\/p><p>Given the risks entailed by the models of diagnosis and treatment outlined, and in the absence of robust scientific testing and evidence to demonstrate their efficacy, it would be inappropriate for either the Government or myself as Minister to endorse such methods. Given that appropriate treatment is available in Ireland, it is unnecessary (and, potentially, unsafe) to seek treatment for Lyme disease abroad. <\/p><p>A Lyme Disease Sub-Committee was established by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). This aims to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to produce a report which identifies the best strategies for the prevention of this disease in Ireland.  The HPSC delayed the publication of its Report in order to incorporate the findings of an extensive systematic review of the evidence on Lyme Disease by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK. This was published earlier this year and the HPSC&rsquo;s own report is now due to be published early in the New Year. In considering the NICE report, the Subcommittee focused solely on the evidence and recommendations contained in the report that related to its remit (specifically in relation to awareness-raising - diagnostics and clinical management aspects fell outside the remit of the Subcommittee). I have been advised that the report of the subcommittee will be recommending the formation of a group of clinicians to review evidence regarding the diagnostics and clinical management of Lyme disease in Ireland as part of its report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":1107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1108,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[50875\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400085#WRT02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress of the Farrelly commission of investigation; if staff giving evidence to the commission who are employed by section 38 and 39 organisations will have their jobs protected; if the costs associated with their absences from work are covered by the HSE; if a reply will issue to queries raised in this regard through correspondence he received on 19 November 2018; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the refusal of the HSE to address this issue will result in key witnesses not being able to attend and give evidence at future hearings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1109,"content":"<p>The work of the Farrelly Commission of Investigation is ongoing.

The SBCI used the &euro;25 million to leverage the Scheme, funding an interest subsidy and guaranteeing first losses.<\/p><p>SBCI did not provide funding but, along with the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs, administered by the European Investment Fund), provided the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.

In such cases, it is also possible for townlands to be deemed eligible as &quot;areas of specific constraint&quot;.  In Ireland's case, we have agreed an approach with the EU Commission to identifying such areas by reference to criteria pertaining to areas of specific environmental importance, townlands facing structural issues relating to farm size and farm fragmentation, and townlands facing constraints relating to the level of permanent grassland cover and field size.  The townland in question did not, however, satisfy any of the thresholds in this regard.<\/p><p>In many cases where townlands are not eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme, there may be no direct financial impact on a farmer's 2019 scheme payment.

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have no function in these commercial decisions.  However, there are on-going consultations between my Department, other Government Departments and agencies, and public and private aviation stakeholders in order to continue to plan for and mitigate the risks associated with Brexit.  It is also important that the aviation industry, including airports, takes steps to prepare and where possible to reduce their exposure and to limit reliance on any one particular destination or service.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that its approach to preparing for Brexit is aimed at minimising the impact it could have on our trade, our economy and seeking an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU. <\/p>  <p>  The full implications of Brexit will only become clear once the future EU-UK relationship has been decided.  However, the Draft Political Declaration setting out the Framework for the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK published recently foresees a comprehensive partnership between the EU and the UK, including across a range of areas of importance to Ireland, including air transport.  The European Commission&rsquo;s Contingency Plan, published on 13 November, outlines plans to propose measures to ensure that disruption to air travel between the UK and the EU will be minimised in the event of a disorderly UK exit from the EU, subject to reciprocity.<\/p>  <p>  Government also supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services more generally through funding for cooperative marketing activity.  Cooperative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote the destination more widely.  Funding of &euro;1 million was made available to Tourism Ireland annually in 2016, 2017 and 2018 for cooperative marketing.  This funding, supported by contributions from regional tourism stakeholders (Airports and Ports) was matched by air and sea carriers and resulted in total overseas marketing expenditure of &euro;2.6 million in 2016 and &euro;2.4 million in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  An increased budget allocation for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January-April and October-December periods for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.  I would encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services, including Shannon Airport with regard to alternative European hub connections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400092#WRAA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Policy","counter":1555,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400092#WRAA04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1556,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[50657\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400092#WRAA04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the steps he will take to achieve a more balanced distribution of visitor numbers to the mid-west and to County Clare (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1275","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1557,"content":"<p>My Department's role in relation to tourism lies primarily in the area of developing national tourism policy, while the tourism agencies have operational responsibility for the implementation of this policy.

The upper age ECCE requirement is that the child must not reach 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year. <\/p>  <p>  This new measure will address the previous situation with regard to multiple entry points whereby there was a broad fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash;(between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child)&ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children. The situation where there was more than one entry point created a perception of inequality to some parents when they considered the variance in the number of weeks of ECCE provision, dependant on their entry point. <\/p>  <p>  The number of entry points reverted to one at the beginning of September 2018. One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help to streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. It also makes it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.<\/p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September of the programme year as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in the following September and continue for a further year from September of the next programme year. Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at age 4 rather than 5 years. These parents may therefore choose to avail of 1 year of ECCE only. However, it is important to note that this is a parental choice and that the overall policy change has ensured that two programme years are available to all children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400093#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1590,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400093#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1591,"qnumday":606,"qnumall":"[50277\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400093#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the public events she attended by county since 1 May 2018 and to date in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1592,"content":"<p>The public events I have attended since the 1st May 2018 are outlined in the following table.<table><tr><th>2018<\/th><th>Event<\/th><th>County<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>02-May<\/td><td>Attending Launch of Gay Games Paris 2018 <\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>04-May<\/td><td>Attending opening of Tallaght Primary Care Centre<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>04-May<\/td><td>Opening of Bishop Galvin &amp;amp; Shanahan School<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>09-May<\/td><td>Attending D&oacute;chas Women's Centre Event<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>09-May<\/td><td>Addressing Children's Rights Alliance AGM<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10-May<\/td><td>Visiting Smyly Trust Services<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12-May<\/td><td>Attending Tallafest 2018 Launch Event<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14-May<\/td><td>Launch of In-School &amp;amp; Pre-School Therapy Project<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14-May<\/td><td>Public Meeting with Minister Donohoe<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17-May<\/td><td>Public meeting re 8th Amendment Referendum<\/td><td>Tipperary<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18-May<\/td><td>Screening of The 34th<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>22-May<\/td><td>ECO-UNESCO Young Environmentalist Awards<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>28-May<\/td><td>Open Early Years Open Policy Debate (Early Childhood Care and Education Over-Age Exemptions)<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>28-May<\/td><td>Launching BeLonG To's Annual Report<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>29-May<\/td><td>Press Conference re Illegal Adoptions<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>31-May<\/td><td>Attending Launch of South Dublin County Council's new LGBTQ+ Staff Network<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>01-Jun<\/td><td>Visiting St Joseph's Special School<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>06-Jun<\/td><td>Attending Dublin Honours Magdalene Supper<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>07-Jun<\/td><td>Opening Early Years Strategy Open Policy Debate (Early Years Strategy)<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>08-Jun<\/td><td>Visiting to Ballyroan Boys National School<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21-Jun<\/td><td>Gay Community News 30th Celebration<\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21-Jun<\/td><td>Dinner in honour of H.E.

This involves working closely with very vulnerable and marginalised young people. There are challenges with recruitment and retention in the area of special care, that are not unique to this jurisdiction. <\/p>  <p>   I am aware that a national recruitment campaign for social care workers was organised by Tusla in 2017 which provided an extensive recruitment panel and talent pool from which newly funded and vacant positions were filled.  I am also aware that due to the challenges in filling posts in the special care area, Tusla has employed agency workers, as a temporary measure, to ensure continuity of care. <\/p>  <p>   Tusla has been engaged in a programme to enhance the capacity and quality of care and therapeutic supports in its special care units.

This is a 27 per cent (&euro;62 million) increase on 2018 and reflects the scale of the Government's ambition and policy commitments to continue to support a diverse range of initiatives aimed at strengthening rural economies and communities.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 sees the beginning of the process of investment under the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF).  This provides unprecedented opportunities to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland.  Importantly, the first projects to be supported under the Fund will begin in 2019 and an allocation of &euro;55 million has been made available for this purpose. I announced the first round of category 1 RRDF funding allocations on 23 November 2018 and will make further announcements early in 2019.<\/p><p>Additional funding of &euro;3.3million was secured for Library Development, bringing the total to &euro;7.2million for 2019, while funding for the Walks Programme will double to &euro;4million. An extra &euro;2.4million of supports will be provided for measures under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan.<\/p><p>I also welcome the increased funding provided for communities in the West and in border areas through the Western Development Commission and the PEACE Programme respectively. <\/p><p>The Revised Estimates will be published in December and will set out the definitive allocations for the coming year. <\/p><p>I am very pleased that increased investment to support rural and community development throughout this country is at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s plans in 2019.

My Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors &ndash; it does not provide and has not provided for funding for CE supervisor pensions.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A number of Departments, including my own Department, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.<\/p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400095#WRDD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wage Subsidy Scheme","counter":1754,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400095#WRDD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1755,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[50427\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400095#WRDD04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of employers in receipt of the wage subsidy scheme under strand 1, 2 and 3; the number of employers that have participated in the scheme since it was introduced; the number of persons with a disability who are engaged with the scheme; and the number of persons with a disability who have engaged in the scheme since its introduction.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1756,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[50428\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400095#WRDD04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the amount spent on the wage subsidy scheme for each of the years since its introduction.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1757,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[50429\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400095#WRDD05000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of inspections of premises carried out in which the wage subsidy scheme is being paid in respect of a person with a disability in each of the years since its introduction.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1758,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[50430\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400095#WRDD05100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of employers that have been disqualified from the wage subsidy scheme since its introduction.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1759,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[50433\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400095#WRDD05200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when her Department last reviewed the wage subsidy scheme, the employability service and the reasonable accommodation fund.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1760,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 662 to 665, inclusive, and 668 together.<\/p><p>The objective of the wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is to increase the likelihood of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market by making available a financial subsidy to private sector employers.

The preparation of a draft Initial Assessment (under Art. 8 of the MSFD) including proposals for Good Environmental Status (Art. 9) and for draft Environmental Targets (Art.10) is underpinned by a suite of monitoring measures to measure the maritime environment against these targets (Art. 11).

To date, 24 hubs have been opened, providing accommodation for over 550 families.  My Department is working closely with the DRHE and other local authorities to deliver further facilities nationally as soon as possible as minimising the use of hotels and self-accommodation is critically dependant on the delivery of additional family hubs.  The location of the hubs will be a matter for individual local authorities and is dependent on the availability of suitable sites or properties.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that families experiencing homelessness receive the supports that they require. Rebuilding Ireland includes a programme of actions across the State Sector with involvement from a range of Government Departments and Agencies.  In 2017, I established the Homelessness Inter-Agency Group to ensure a coordinated response to the State&rsquo;s response to homelessness. The Group includes representation from all of the Government Departments and Agencies involved in the delivery of homeless services, including Tusla, the HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  <\/p>  <p>  All family hubs are operated in accordance with service level agreements\/contracts between the local authorities and service providers.  In the Dublin area, the DRHE has put in place service level agreements\/contracts with a range of service providers for 20 family hubs.  These agreements\/contracts provide that families accessing family hub accommodation are supported in identifying and securing independent tenancies, including through the use of the HAP Placefinder service, within a six month period.  <\/p>  <p>  The expansion of the family hub programme will facilitate the provision of greater supports to families experiencing homelessness and facilitate more expeditious exits from homelessness into independent tenancies.  It is accepted that in some cases, due to the accommodation requirements or preferences of some families, it may not be possible to facilitate their exit from the hub within a six-month period.   As such, I have no plans to introduce regulations in this regard at this time.<\/p>  <p>   In relation to the duration of time spent in emergency accommodation, the quarterly performance reports prepared by the local authorities include information on the duration of time spent by individuals in emergency accommodation but do not include a breakdown for families.

Progress to date on the objectives in that strategy include the recognition of landscape in law in an amendment to the Planning and Development Acts.  The Planning and Development Acts 2000 (as amended) therefore now specify that development plans shall contain objectives for the encouragement of the management of features of the landscape, such as traditional field boundaries, important for the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network and essential for the migration, dispersal and genetic exchange of wild species. <\/p>  <p>  Further to the objective in the National Landscape Strategy to increase public awareness, the Heritage Council now provides a range of supports to organisations engaged in landscape partnerships and community projects such as the Wicklow Mountains Uplands Council, Burrenbeo and the Irish Uplands Forum. The Council has also recently engaged an uplands co-ordinator to provide support to community-based heritage projects nationally across a range of areas as well as promoting the significance of High Nature Value Farming through results based schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to legislation I would like to note that my Department's forthcoming Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill contains provisions which will give me express powers to assist and promote research and public awareness in a number of fields, including in relation to landscapes.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to say that I recently launched the public consultation phase of a new Heritage plan, Heritage Ireland 2030.  Heritage Ireland 2030 is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a revitalised and refreshed National Heritage plan.  It will provide a coherent national heritage policy, recognising its importance to local communities and global visitors alike. Community engagement will lie at the heart of Heritage Ireland 2030, reflecting the values, visions and concerns of our citizens, communities, farmers tourists and businesses. The on-going priority and associated resourcing of the National Landscape Strategy will be further determined in the context of that plan.  The consultation is open until 28 February 2019 and I hope and expect that all of those with an interest in caring for and managing our heritage will make a submission.
