Over 2,200 submissions were received from members of the public, stakeholders and elected representatives. Five common themes emerged as follows: - walking &amp;amp; cycling; access, gates &amp;amp; roads; public transport; movement within the park and public consultation. The recommendations contained within the report were to be advanced in three phases, over the next seven years. With regard to Phase 1 (years 0-2), the following proposals have been activated by my department as set out within the report.<\/p>  <p>  A programme of improvements to walking and cycling infrastructure commenced in 2021 with the instillation of over 2.5km of re-laid footpaths along the North road which greatly improved the quality and alignment of the footpath surface. Dropped kerbs were installed at strategic points along the route to ensure universal access for all.  A series of small local footpath upgrades have also taken place. <\/p>  <p>  The design and plans for the 4.5km permanent one directional cycle lanes along Chesterfield Avenue, linking Castleknock to the city, are currently being developed with the National Transport Authority &amp;amp; Dublin City Council. In the interim, the tender has been awarded for the supply and installation of traffic lane separators for the entire length of Chesterfield Avenue, on both sides of the road. Works on site are due to commence in February 2022.  Over 8km of temporary cones will be removed and these new durable and strong dividers will ensure a safer experience for both cyclists and vehicles using Chesterfield Avenue. In addition, over 40 new bike stands have been installed throughout the Park with an additional 70 planned for 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW is currently preparing a 3-year programme of pedestrian and cycle improvements including provision of bike parking infrastructure throughout the Park.<\/p>  <p>  Further to the recommendations in the Transport and Mobility Options Report, the implementation of the 9-month pilot study of cul-de-sacs on the North Road &amp;amp; Upper Glen Road will commence on Monday 28 February 2022. The North Road will be temporarily closed from 21 February to facilitate enabling works including the instillation of bollards, new road markings, signage etc and will reopen on 28 February as a one-way system, in the City direction only. Likewise, on the Upper Glen Road, enabling works will commence from February 21 to facilitate the installation of bollards, signage and line marking in advance of the pilot cul-de-sacs commencing on the 28 February 2022. Access will not be impacted to those institutions in close proximity to these pilot studies routes.<\/p>  <p>  Traffic data collection points were installed throughout the Phoenix Park in late 2021 and will record vehicular and cycle data over the next 6 months.<\/p>  <p>  Under the theme 'Movement within the Park', the OPW and An Garda Siochana have been actively refining plans for the introduction of a 30kmph speed limit in the Park from 28 February 2022.  A robust operations and communications plan will be put in place in advance of the reduction of speed limit from 50kph to 30kph. This measure should see a marked difference in driver behaviour making the Park a safer place for those using it for recreational purposes. An Garda Siochana will monitor compliance with the new speed limit and will take appropriate action when necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Long-stay commuter parking, as well as high levels of illegal parking within and around the perimeter of the Park were identified as a major issue in the Study. As a result. one of the key recommendations of the Study was the development of a Parking Strategy to examine ways in which we can address parking demand and traffic volumes at key attractions such as the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre and Dublin Zoo, but also promote the switch to sustainable modes of travel to access the Park, which is a key aspiration of the Transport and Mobility Options Study.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the Parking Strategy will primarily be focused on measures related to visitor parking including bike parking, and in light of the aims and objectives of the Transport and Mobility Options Study, emphasis will be on providing for those visitors who have no other option than to use a car to visit the Park. The Strategy will also address the needs of those with mobility issues and their parking requirements. The Strategy will however, also be required to address issues such as long stay commuter parking and illegal parking within the Park.<\/p>  <p>  Given that recommendations for the Phoenix Park could impact the surrounding areas and communities, a secondary study area encompassing residential areas surrounding the Park will also be considered when assessing the impacts of proposed options that might be developed as part of the overall Parking Strategy for the Park.<\/p>  <p>  I can also advise that the National Transport Authority is currently trialling bus options for the Park and they do hope to have recommendations in early 2022 for the best options available to serve the Phoenix Park and surrounding areas. <\/p>  <p>  The OPW has initiated a review of the legislation pertaining to the bye-laws of the Phoenix Park with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and other relevant Government departments, with regard to the regulation of traffic and parking within the Phoenix Park.<\/p>  <p>  I&rsquo;d like to emphasise that I personally have met with the relevant public representatives on a number of occasions at key stages in the process over the last eighteen months with a view to listening and understanding the concerns of constituents with regard to transport and mobility issues in, and around the Park. My officials have also made detailed presentations to Local Area Committees of both Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council to brief local Councillors on the details of the report as it went to consultation. They also met them again last October to brief them on the recommendations for implementation contained in the final report produced following the public consultation process. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed communications plan is currently being finalised to provide the public with notice of the proposed changes to speed limit within the Park along with the commencement of pilot studies on 28th February. This will include provision of signage throughout the Park, messaging through digital and traditional communications platform along with direct engagement with internal and external park stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  The OPW is committed to continuing engagement with the public on all of these issues and assures all stakeholders that the conservation and presentation of the Phoenix Park to international best practice while accommodating access for all is paramount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[1969\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that adequate measures have been taken in respect of public expenditure and reform to withstand the ongoing impact of Covid-19; if supports for vulnerable sectors will continue in the face of rising Covid-19 infections and the impact this has on several areas of the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>Significant direct expenditure supports have been put in place by Government since early 2020 to respond to the impacts of Covid-19.

This funding has supported the delivery of key public services while addressing the challenges of Covid-19 and has provided for critical income and employment supports to our workers and businesses, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). <\/p>  <p>  Key measures have been extended as necessary since the beginning of the pandemic in order to continue essential support, most recently in response to the impact of the Omicron wave where a number of further measures were agreed by Government including for the EWSS and PUP schemes and measures for particularly impacted sectors.  <\/p>  <p>  The careful phased withdrawal of Covid-19 supports is essential both to support society and the economy to recover from the impact of Covid-19, and to return our public finances to a sustainable position. In this context, with the phased withdrawal of supports, it will be important to target measures at those sectors of the economy most affected by the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Of the &euro;7 billion available for Covid-19 related measures in 2022, &euro;3.1 billion has already been allocated to Departments, including for projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, while &euro;3.9 billion remains held in reserve. This contingency reserve provides Government with the flexibility to respond to the pandemic during 2022 and will be allocated as needed during the year to specific expenditure measures that can be most effective at that particular time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[2480\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the Office of Public Works engagement to protect the Glendruid Dolmen in Brennanstown, D&uacute;n Laoghaire; and if efforts will be made to ensure continued public access to this important historical site.","asker":"1481","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>Glendruid Dolmen in Brennanstown is in the Guardianship of the State.

While it is a historic landscape of international significance enjoyed by millions of people on a yearly basis, it is also home to a number of important institutions including St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Garda Headquarters and Aras an Uachtarain, all of which require 24 hour access. Further, it occupies a strategic position within the greater Dublin area, as the main road of the Park, Chesterfield Avenue, is a major artery linking the Castleknock\/Blanchardstown area to the city, which is also regularly utilised by emergency services over the 24 hour period. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Irish National War Memorial Gardens (INWMG) and the Irish Museum of Modern Art (Royal Hospital, Kilmainham) (IMMA), these parks and gardens are solely utilised for recreational, commemorative and cultural purposes with no requirement for 24-hour access. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish National War Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge occupy an area of about eight hectares on the southern banks of the River Liffey, almost opposite the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park and approximately three kilometres from the centre of Dublin. The gardens commemorate the 49,400 soldiers who lost their lives in the WWI and some 450,000 people visit these exquisite and tranquil gardens on an annual basis.<\/p>  <p>  Works on the iconic Royal Hospital commenced in 1680 to accommodate &lsquo;the aged and maimed officers and soldiers&rsquo; from the Irish armies and was largely completed and occupied by 1687. The baroque gardens and surrounding grounds have been recreated to offer the public opportunities to appreciate culture, biodiversity and designed landscapes, while providing the setting for the Royal Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Both the INWMG and IMMA are culturally sensitive locations with historic buildings and fragile landscapes, which are enjoyed by nearly one million recreational visitors on an annual basis, during daylight hours. It is important to note that similar locations throughout Ireland managed by Local Authorities such as Malahide Castle grounds, closes every evening from 4pm to 9pm depending on the season. Likewise areas within the Phoenix Park such as the Peoples Gardens operate similar opening hours to Malahide Castle, INWMG and IMMA.<\/p>  <p>  While the grounds of the INWMG are open via a right of way along the Liffey, the park gates are open  from Monday to Saturday from 7.30am to 4pm\/ 9pm depending on the season and from 9.30am on Sundays.<\/p>  <p>  The grounds of IMMA are open to the public, Monday to Saturday from 8.00am to 6.30pm and on Sundays from 11.00am. They are closed on Good Friday and 24 December to 26 December.<\/p>  <p>  The opening and closing times for both the INWMG and IMMA should not be considered in the same light as the Phoenix Park, given their distinct differences in scale and functions. Further, both INWMG and IMMA were designed to be utilised during daylight hours and would pose a serious risks to the public&rsquo;s safety should they be opened during the hours of darkness. In addition, neither park has sufficient public lighting nor staff in order to maintain the appropriate levels of security that would be required to protect the public, monuments and buildings etc.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the OPW has no plans to alter the general opening times of the Irish National War Memorial Gardens or the grounds of the Irish Museum of Modern Art at present, but will keep the opening times under review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[2594\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000074#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the capital expenditure allocated for infrastructure projects for County Cork for 2022; the projects for which this funding will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I am responsible for setting the overall capital allocations across Departments and for monitoring monthly expenditure at Departmental level.

Management and delivery of investment projects and public services within allocation\u00a0is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The update of the Public Spending Code in 2019 combined with lessons learned from domestic projects and international best practice highlighted the need for more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects, particularly in the areas of planned delivery, costings and risk. This is to ensure that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.<\/p>  <p>  In order to achieve this, my Department has introduced two key reforms: <\/p>  <p>  - The introduction of an External Assurance Process (EAP) to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages. The EAP for major public capital projects (projects which cost in excess of &euro;100m) will focus on issues such as cost, risk and ability to deliver, at two key points in the project lifecycle, Decision Gate 1 (Approval in Principle) and Decision Gate 2 (Pre-Tender Approval). <\/p>  <p>  - A new Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) has been established to further strengthen project management. As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the MPAG in advance of the decision to proceed. The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  - While there was an impact on building activity earlier last year due to Covid restrictions, activity in the sector ramped up significantly when restrictions were lifted in April. <\/p>  <p>  - Capital expenditure drawdown can be lumpy in any year for any number of reasons such as delays in planning, delays in completion or even weather conditions.\u00a0 As such, capital carryover is in place to assist Departments with the management of their capital spend across years to alleviate pressures and delays caused by timing issues and the impact of unexpected occurrences. This procedure is also designed to promote value-for-money in the use of capital funding, in particular by mitigating any incentive on the part of public bodies or Departments to spend any remaining capital allocation at end-year in an accelerated manner rather than surrender it to the Exchequer. <\/p>  <p>  - I firmly believe that the capital carryover facility, as legislated for under Section 91 of the Finance Act, 2004 is the most appropriate provision to assist Departments in managing their capital allocations. A maximum of 10% of the original capital allocation is permitted to be carried over into the following year, which allows for the capital funding to be drawn down in a considered and deliberate manner that maximises public benefit. \u00a0This facility only applies to capital expenditure and not current expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000075#WRC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000075#WRC05200"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[2357\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000075#WRC05300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on the report of the Independent Body Examining Additional Working Hours; if the Government is accepting the recommendations; the estimated full-year cost of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>Chapter 4 of Building Momentum - A new public service agreement, 2021-2022 provides that the parties to the Agreement recognise and accept that certain measures introduced under the Public Service Stability Agreements, including the &ldquo;Haddington Road Agreement&rdquo; are considered outstanding matters to be resolved as part of this Agreement.<\/p><p>In this context Section 4.2 of the Agreement provided for the establishment of an independent body to assess issues arising in addressing the Haddington Road Hours and to make appropriate recommendations to be applied equitably across all affected grades, groups, categories and sectors.<\/p><p>An Independent Hours Body chaired by Kieran Mulvey, former head of the Workplace\u00a0Relations Commission, and comprising\u00a0of employer, trade union representatives and independent members\u00a0was established last\u00a0April.

This comprised almost &euro;77.6 billion in current spending and over &euro;9.9 billion in capital expenditure. This level of expenditure is nearly &euro;2.3 billion or 2.6% higher than expenditure in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The total gross amount allocated to Ministerial Vote Groups for 2021 was &euro;88.9 billion.

The REV also included provision for &euro;5.4 billion in contingency funding to respond to the impacts of Covid-19, which was held in reserve rather than allocated at Departmental level in order to allow Government flexibility to respond as needed over the year. This unallocated funding brought the overall Government Expenditure Ceiling for 2021 to &euro;87.8 billion. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  During 2021, as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to impact following the resurgence of the virus at the end of 2020, additional funding for key response measures was allocated to Departments through Further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates. These additional allocations totalled &euro;6&frac12;\u00a0billion and were met through using in full the contingency funding that had been set aside and providing additional funding of &euro;1.1 billion which increased the Government Expenditure Ceiling to the end year total of &euro;88.9 billion.

This is to ensure that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The revised NDP pledges to restructure the oversight and implementation of capital projects to strengthen scrutiny of major public investment proposals and to drive improved project performance and value for money.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the majority of public investment projects are delivered on budget and on time and there is a high level of professionalism across the sectors. However, having recognised the higher risk profile of larger projects, new procedures have been introduced in order to improve project outturns, avoid cost overruns and avoid scheduled delays.<\/p>  <p>  In November, my Department put in place an External Assurance Process (EAP) to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages.\u00a0This will involve independent expert reviews at two key stages in the project lifecycle under the Public Spending Code (Approval in principal and prior to tender).\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the EAP is to improve value for money and support funding departments and Government with expert insight relating to project risks, delivery feasibility, and robustness of costings, governance and procurement. The EAP for major public capital projects (projects which cost in excess of &euro;100m) will focus on issues such as cost, risk and ability to deliver.<\/p>  <p>  To support the External Assurance Process a new Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) has been established to further strengthen project management. As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the\u00a0Advisory Group\u00a0in advance of the decision to proceed. The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that timelines associated with Public Spending Code compliance are a fraction of the time required for compliance with the range of statutory requirements such as planning, environmental impact assessment, habitats directive and appropriate assessment.

There is also a need to look even further, beyond the challenges that have been brought upon by the impact of the pandemic, to ensure a long term shift towards a more sustainable tourism ecosystem.<\/p>  <p>  Late last year I brought a report to Government, developed by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group under the aegis of my Department, which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices ahead of the development of a new national tourism policy. The successful implementation of the actions in this interim action plan will ensure that sustainability is taken into account in policy development, business planning by the tourism agencies and industry as well as in destination management and promotional activity. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I secured a record level of funding for tourism. This funding will support measures to help address short-term survival-related concerns and also enable recovery across the tourism sector as we reopen to international tourism and begin to transition to a more sustainable future. In addition this funding will also allow the tourism agencies to deliver on their commitments in the sustainable tourism interim action plan. <\/p>  <p>  For example, this year F&aacute;ilte Ireland will develop and roll out a suite of supports and workshops to help tourism businesses to implement sustainability best practice and use the benefits of sustainability for their business. F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also initiate the development of carbon calculators which will allow tourists and tourism businesses to evaluate the impact of their carbon footprint on the environment. Tourism Ireland will create new sales and marketing opportunities for those sustainable tourism businesses that want to grow their international business. Measures such as these will shine a light on areas and destinations at home that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism.<\/p>  <p>  In line with our Programme for Government commitments, officials within my Department have taken initial steps towards the development of a new national tourism policy which will mainstream sustainability. It is clear that the traditional model of tourism is changing and the development of this new policy will set out a path for the coming years and beyond which will support a sustainable recovery, not only from an environmental but also social and economic viewpoints.<\/p>  <p>  To successfully deliver on sustainable tourism we need to provide high quality environments and experiences which drive improved visitor satisfaction levels with a greater regional spread of tourism visitation and value. I look forward to this transition for the tourism industry and for our destinations with better access to information and tools for visitors to practice responsible tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000077#WRE04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadcasting Sector","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000077#WRE04900"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[2437\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000077#WRE05000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when the new watchdog Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will be established and begin its necessary work; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[2506\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000077#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of preparing the regulatory capacity, structures and expertise of the media commission ahead of its planned establishment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 198 together.<\/p>  <p>The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will, when enacted, formally dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and establish a new regulator,\u00a0Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, which will be responsible for overseeing the regulation of broadcasting and video on-demand services and the new regulatory framework for online safety set out in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  All provisions of the Bill are subject to a commencement order.

This initiative was put in place in order to increase the number of qualified persons with Irish language skills in the context of the requirements arising from the status of Irish as an official and working language of the EU and also from the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003. <\/p><p>The fund, which is administered by the Department in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), provides funding for a range of specialised third-level Irish language courses in areas such as translation, interpretation, IT and law. Currently there are 12 courses, provided by various institutions, in operation. These programmes have had a major input into increasing the translation capacity of EU institutions, thus ending of the derogation on the Irish language&rsquo;s status in the EU.<\/p><p><b>Aistritheoir&iacute; &Oacute;ga<\/b><\/p><p>The fourth Aistritheoir&iacute; &Oacute;ga competition for secondary schools has taken place in conjunction with the European Commission.

Under these programmes, successful applicants spend a year in U.S. and Canadian universities working as Foreign Language Teaching Assistants (FLTAs) and teach Irish language and culture. Students also have an opportunity to visit the Gaeltacht to learn Irish language and culture from native speakers. My Department also funds numerous universities in Europe in order to support the teaching of Irish.<\/p><p><b>Technological and Digital Initiatives<\/b><\/p><p>My\u00a0Department provides funding for a range of initiatives for the promotion of Irish in the field of technology. A Digital Strategy for Irish is currently\u00a0being prepared which addresses gaps such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology, machine translation and\u00a0sharing of translation resources such as translation memories - all vitally important in the provision of public services.

In the pursuit of that objective, we are committed to a Sport for All approach aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023, which includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.<\/p>  <p>  That plan contains a specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. It further commits that this new fund will apply the Sport for all&rsquo; ethos.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in other funding streams provided by my Department.\u00a0 For example, Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  One of the key aims of the national sports policy is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport support entirely by 2027. The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor, ISM, report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years. Unfortunately, while the ISM report for the first quarter of 2021 showed that the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest ISM figures for quarter 3 showed that the gender gap was beginning to re-emerge as Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. In quarter 3 of 2021, male sport participation had returned to pre-pandemic levels, at 48%, while female participation was 38%, 7% behind the level measured in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The emerging gradient is a cause for focus, concern and ongoing monitoring. It is now crucial that we move to ensure that the gap is narrowed and closed. To this end, many governing bodies will begin to deliver women in sport in dormant accounts funding programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have disproportionately been impacted by the pandemic, including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities. <\/p>  <p>  These targeted activities form part of a winter initiative for sport to kickstart participation following the reduction in restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to emphasise the important contribution that Sport Ireland makes in this area. Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its Participation Plan 2021-2024 &ndash; Increasing Participation in Changing Ireland. The Participation Plan outlines how Sport Ireland will continue to help people get active by removing barriers to participation in sport and physical activity in the coming years. The Sport Ireland Participation Plan actions will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies, strategic partners, clubs, communities and individuals.<\/p>  <p>  The Sport Ireland Participation Plan is built on, and guided by, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 (NSP) and the Sport Ireland Strategy 2018-2022.

This investment will greatly benefit the artists in this area and help address the deficit in artist workspaces in Dublin City.<\/p><p>The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 provides\u00a0capital grants for arts and culture centres and is administered by my Department.\u00a0 The schemes focus on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. In line with the Government's action on climate change, projects that reduce an organisation's carbon footprint that will make a real and positive impact on the environment, are prioritised, as are projects that provide additional capacity for artists and artistic production. The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is constructed of a number of funding steams one of which is Stream C which is aimed at upgrading visual artists' workspaces and was run by Visual Artists Ireland (VAI) on behalf of my Department.<\/p><p>The Arts Council operates many current funding schemes and initiatives for the particular support of visual arts, including the Visual Artists Workspace Scheme, to support artists&rsquo; and provide the best possible working environment for visual artists.<\/p><p>The \u00a0Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my Department to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.\u00a0 Under its Creative Communities initiative, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022.\u00a0 These strategies were developed by local authorities, including their Arts Offices, following extensive local public consultation.\u00a0 They are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area thereby empowering creatives and artists to live and work in their local communities.<\/p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme has also explored community and collaborative place-making initiatives that might serve as a catalyst for change and opportunity for further investment.\u00a0 With Programme funding during 2021, for example, the Irish Architecture Foundation worked with a network of 46 community organisations - Community Organization and Residents Network (CORN) - across the South West Inner City to reimagine a future for Marshalsea Barracks that once loomed large in Dublin 8 community life and local history.<\/p><p>In response to Covid 19 the\u00a0Outdoor Public Space Scheme was introduced by\u00a0my Department \u00a0to help local authorities open up and create public spaces and facilities dedicated to the arts, culture and festivals. The scheme was developed in consultation with the County and City Management Association and with input from F&aacute;ilte Ireland. Each local authority can apply for up to &euro;250,000 under the scheme. To\u00a0date, 18 local authorities have been awarded funding of more than &euro;4.4 million under this scheme.\u00a0 Under the scheme,\u00a0local authorities are encouraged to prioritise place-making projects that support cultural endeavour and enable safe social activity. <\/p><p>Under the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme, a total of 88 grants of up to &euro;25,000 each have been awarded to venues, performance facilities and private sector classes throughout the country for Covid adaptation improvements, including ventilation. These grants have been paid out by my Department last month.<\/p><p>The issues raised by the Deputies were discussed during the consultation process for the Report of the Night-Time Economy which I launched last year.\u00a0 Planning was a key discussion point for the Taskforce and they recommended the<b><\/b>development of specific best practice guidance to assist local authorities in including appropriate, locally-tailored provisions to plan effectively for the Night-Time Economy, which includes cultural spaces, in a multi-use urban context.\u00a0 I will also be hosting a high-level workshop with Minister O&rsquo;Brien and Minister of State Burke this year with the night-time economy sector and key stakeholders to discuss possible solutions and ideas in this area and I look forward to the outcome of those discussions.\u00a0 There are many other recommendations which will work towards finding solutions to the issues raised including a number of Arts Council led actions to facilitate more use of publicly-owned cultural buildings and heritage sites for events and to create a viable model for the development of sustainable creative co-operatives looking at national and international best practice.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department does not provide funding to organisations to purchase land or buildings.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) was launched in 2018 to support more compact and sustainable development.\u00a0 The Department for Housing, Planning, and Local Government has responsibility for its implementation.

In recognition of the importance of the Night-Time Economy, I published and launched the Report of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce last September which contains 36 recommendations\/actions in the area of regulation, licensing, planning, transport, safety and increasing the diversity of activities as part of the night-time offering.   I am working with colleagues across Government and stakeholders to drive the implementation of the various actions in this Report and work is well underway to implement the actions in the Report.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the reopening of the night-time economy and particularly the nightclub sector, in its decision of 19 October 2021, Government agreed that the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector could reopen with a full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the COVID-19 pass.  Nightclubs were permitted to open at 100% capacity but those attending were required to have an electronic ticket, acquired at least one hour in advance, for contact tracing purposes. <\/p>  <p>  At that time, I said that my Department would carry out a review in three weeks to assess how the post 22 October measures had worked on the ground and also to consider whether there were other measures that sectors could take to assist with the public health goals. However, as the Deputy will be aware, approximately three weeks later, the epidemiological situation had deteriorated and unfortunately the Government had to make the difficult decision to impose new restrictions which brought in a midnight closing time for all pubs, restaurants and nightclubs.  Subsequent decisions, based on public health advice, have meant the effective closure of the nightclub sector. <\/p>  <p>Throughout this challenging period, my officials and I and colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Health and the Department of An Taoiseach have continued to engage with the various sectors that operate in the night-time economy to address some of the challenges faced and plan for the next phase of reopening.  My Department recently met with the sector on Thursday 13th   January.  Nightclubs will be able to re-open as soon as public health circumstances permit. In making decisions, Government is always conscious of following public health advice and any decisions made to in relation to re-opening the nightclubs will be decided on the current public health advice. I will continue to work with these sectors as we move through the different stages of recovery from this incredibly challenging period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000079#WRG04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000079#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[2518\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000079#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if extra funding for an institution (details supplied) in County Carlow to offset losses in recent years due to the pandemic will be provided for; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>Primary support for the arts, including organisations such as that referred to by the Deputy,\u00a0is delivered by the Arts Council.\u00a0 In 2021, the Government allocated a record allocation of &euro;130m to the Arts Council.

of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to an issue (details supplied) in relation to the introduction of anti-dumping duties on iron and steel fasteners imported from China.","asker":"1514","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>Under the EU Treaties, competence for International Trade Policy, known as the Common Commercial Policy, and including Trade Defence, is vested in the European Commission under Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  In exercising this competence, there are a variety of supporting Committees and Working Parties through which the Member States and the Commission engage, including on Trade Defence measures.<\/p>  <p>  An \"anti-dumping\" investigation allows the Commission to determine whether goods being imported into the EU are being sold below the price charged in the domestic market of the producing country, i.e. being dumped on the EU market to the detriment of EU producers. During the investigation process, the Commission endeavours to engage with all stakeholders including exporters, importers and user interests to gain a broad understanding of the supply chains of the product(s) concerned and the, on occasion, competing interests of producers and<\/p>  <p>   users in order to reach a balanced outcome that defends Union producers from unfair competition while ensuring that users and importers can continue to source goods from a wide variety of producers, including other third country producers.<\/p>  <p>  \"Definitive\" anti-dumping investigations, such as in the case identified by the Deputy, are dealt with by the Trade Defence Instruments Committee, which is convened by the European Commission. Voting on definitive measures is conducted by way of Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) and the imposition of measures requires a qualified majority in favour of the proposal. To reach the qualified majority threshold, 55% of EU Member States (15) representing at least 65% of the total EU population must vote in favour of a measure. In this regard, however, I must emphasise that all aspects of the consultations within the Trade Defence Instruments Committee, including the votes of individual Member States, are confidential.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, as part of its role in assessing Commission trade defence investigations proposals, engages with domestic producers, local importers and users, where identified, with the aim of assessing both the impact of dumping on the Irish market including the impact the proposed trade defence measures may have on users and importers of the product in question. <\/p>  <p>  Decisions regarding Ireland&rsquo;s position on specific trade issues are considered through a prism of a number of policy considerations with a balanced position sought as they relate to issues of trade policy, such as Union producer, user and consumer interests. Furthermore, while Ireland continues to support an open, rules-based trading environment, at the same time, we also need to ensure that agreed multilateral trade-rules are applied uniformly, with full transparency to ensure that wider EU commercial interests are protected, and that EU industry is not unfairly disadvantaged as a result of third country trade practices that distort the EU market.  Equally, measures must be proportionate in rebalancing the market and be deployed carefully and on a strong evidential basis. In this regard, I am confident that this approach allows for a methodical and comprehensive assessment of the facts of a case while taking into account the interests of users and importers and the general interests of the Union.<\/p>  <p>  Specific to the case in question, the Trade Defence team in my Department has received representations from several interested parties. The representations provided information such as the status of Irish manufacturing of the product, concerns regarding the inflationary impact of proposed trade defence measures, the lack of alternative sources of supply and the impact COVID-19 has had on the ability of Irish and European importers to source material elsewhere. So, I wish to assure the Deputy, that these inputs have been included as part of my Department's overall assessment of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal. Moreover, Member States have been asked to submit their opinion on the case to the Trade Defence Committee by the 19th January with the final outcome of the Trade Defence Committee&rsquo;s assessment to be published in the Official Journal of the EU.  While I must reiterate that individual Member State positions are confidential, my Department fully understands the interests that several importers have brought to our attention and the implications for them of a positive decision by the EU's Trade Defence Instruments Committee. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to advise that a separate Commission investigation - but related to the trade defence case in question &ndash; may be conducted to assess whether market conditions in the Union at present permit the suspension of measures for a period of up to 9 months should a decision be taken that definitive duties be imposed. The suspension of measures is permitted in cases where current market conditions do not reflect the market conditions in place during the Commission's \"investigation period\". Supply-chain issues and higher pricing as a result of COVID-19 having a negative impact on the availability of a range of products in the EU market is well understood by my Department. Therefore, if such an investigation is conducted by the Commission which results in a recommendation to suspend the imposition of measures - were such definitive measures carried - the Trade Defence team will assess the recommendation based on the Commission's report and the information received from industry to date.  In this regard, my Department's Trade Policy Unit is happy to remain engaged with industry representatives and are contactable at trade@enterprise.gov.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000081#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000081#WRJ01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Obligation","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000081#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[2689\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000081#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will provide a schedule of the amount of Public Service Obligation levy collected since it was introduced to date under the headings of domestic customers, small commercial customers and medium and large customers; the way in which this levy is redistributed when collected; if he is satisfied that all funds are used for their intended purposes when allocated; and the way in which he ensures compliance with same.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy is charged to all electricity final customers in Ireland\u00a0and is collected from customers by electricity suppliers.\u00a0 The PSO levy\u00a0is a vital policy support for the development of renewable electricity and to enable Ireland reach national and EU renewable energy and climate targets.

The electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European Union regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, including the matters raised by the Deputy, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas.In line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014. Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. Each such company has its own different approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base.<\/p><p>The policy\u00a0position of successive Governments,\u00a0has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices and to support competition to drive down prices. Data from approved price comparison sites shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers.In terms of supports for small business owners, the supports\u00a0 - focussed more towards SME&rsquo;s - are the following:<\/p><p>- Support Scheme for Energy Audits. It supports SMEs with a &euro;2,000 voucher towards the costs of a professional energy audit.<\/p><p>- The Communities Energy Grant (CEG) Scheme.

Secured properties remain in the ownership and control of their registered owners, or appointed receivers where applicable. These parties are responsible for all matters relating to the management of secured properties, including engagement with State agencies who may have an interest in the property. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that its debtors and receivers have engaged with the OPW on numerous occasions regarding properties which were secured to NAMA. In some cases, this engagement resulted in secured assets being leased or sold to the OPW by the debtor\/receiver however, NAMA, as mortgage holder, was not directly involved in any engagement between the parties. Under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA is unable to divulge confidential information regarding NAMA debtors or their assets, or transactions in which they are involved. It is therefore not possible to identify the particular assets which were leased or sold to the OPW as to do so would identify the owners as NAMA debtors.

This includes various statutory Codes of Conduct issued and amended by the Central Bank, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2013, Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Regulations 2016, and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that, within the remit of its responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers, its approach to debt resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that regulated entities have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) sets out the requirements that regulated firms must comply with when dealing with consumers in order to ensure a similar level of protection for consumers, regardless of the type of financial services provider. The Code specifies that regulated firms must, at all times, act &lsquo;honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market&rsquo; and that they do not &lsquo;exert undue pressure or undue influence on a customer&rsquo; <\/p>  <p>  In relation to a mortgage loan which is secured on a primary residence, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2013 (the CCMA) provides a strong consumer protection framework, requiring relevant firms to ensure that borrowers who are in arrears or pre-arrears\u00a0are treated in a transparent and fair manner.  <\/p>  <p>  Where an Alternative Repayment Arrangement (ARA) is offered to the borrower, the regulated entity must inform the borrower of the reasons why the ARA offered is considered appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances. Where the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed, in line with Provision 40 of the CCMA, any change to the ARA must be appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Where the entity does not offer an ARA, for example where it is concluded that the mortgage is not sustainable and an ARA is unlikely to be appropriate, the entity must provide the reasons on paper or another durable medium to the borrower, as well as other relevant information including other options available to the borrower and an estimate of associated costs or charges where known and, where not known, a list of the associated costs or charges.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the Consumer Protection Code apply when the loan is not a\u00a0loan which falls within the scope of the CCMA. The Code requires that regulated entities have in place written procedures for the handling of arrears. Where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to mutually agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Specified information in relation to arrears must be made available to personal consumers, including general information to encourage the consumer to deal with arrears and stating the benefits of dealing with arrears.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If the debtor is not happy with the service they receive from a credit servicing firm or any other regulated entity, they have the right to complain to that firm. The firm will handle the complaint in accordance with its complaints handling process. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 also includes rules that firms must follow when they handle the complaint. If the complaint is not resolved to the consumer&rsquo;s satisfaction, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, where they are an &lsquo;eligible consumer&rsquo; covered by that Scheme.

This expenditure, to fund temporary measures to address the impact of the pandemic, has been dealt with separately from expenditure on the delivery of core programmes and infrastructure and the careful phased withdrawal of this spending is essential both to support society and the economy to recover from the impact of Covid-19 and to return our public finances to a sustainable position. <\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;30 billion in direct expenditure supports has been made available across 2020 and 2021 and Budget 2022 outlined provision for up to &euro;7 billion in Covid-19 related spending, with &euro;3.1 billion of this already allocated to continue support measures. A further &euro;3.9 billion is held in reserve to allow Government flexibility to respond to continued impacts of the pandemic during 2022, targeting supports at where they can have the greatest impact. <\/p>  <p>  Along with the funding provision for Covid-19, significant increases in core expenditure have also been provided for 2022, in line with the sustainable level of increased expenditure set out under the agreed medium term expenditure strategy to 2025. \u00a0Core current expenditure in 2022 is projected to grow by &euro;3.1 billion, about 4.6%, relative to the core expenditure position set out for 2021 in Expenditure Report 2022, while the Expenditure Report outlined growth of &euro;1.1 billion or 11.7% in core capital expenditure allocations. Ensuring value for money from this expenditure is an ongoing priority of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the budgetary process, including an enhanced focus across Government on issues of performance and national well-being. This will build on a range of reforms introduced in recent years to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework and ensure that expenditure is managed in an efficient, effective and strategic way. This ongoing work includes the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework, the Spending Review process, Performance Budgeting and Equality Budgeting and the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Managing expenditure within their respective allocations is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister, particularly given the level of funding being provided, and careful monitoring of spending against profile and of progress on programmes and projects will continue to be required.

These include:<\/p><p>- ongoing work by the Commercial Skills Academy in the Office of Government Procurement<\/p><p>- the establishment of the Public Infrastructure Network (the InfraNet) for those involved in capital project delivery;<\/p><p>- expansion of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES);\u00a0<\/p><p>- a range of reforms in the planning area including the establishment of a new Division of the High Court dealing with planning and environmental issues and\u00a0<\/p><p>- the commissioning of the Supporting Excellence report through the EU Structural Reform Support Programme to review the capability of the public service to deliver the capital programme. On foot of one of the recommendations in that report, my Department convened an Action Team comprising of internal\/external experts to tailor and set out a roadmap for implementation of the proposed solutions in more detail.\u00a0The Supporting Excellence Action Team published their report alongside the National Development Plan 2021-30.\u00a0The Action Team&rsquo;s report includes 34 specific actions aimed at supporting excellence in boosting capability in individual sectors; from the centre, and improving co-ordination and guidance to support excellence on a system wide basis.

As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the MPAG in advance of the decision to proceed. The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland.  <\/blockquote>  <p>These reforms, alongside ongoing engagement with the construction sector regarding capacity and innovation, will help ensure the effective delivery of Project Ireland 2040 on time and on budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000082#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":469,"content":"<p>Question No. 189 answered with Question No. 188.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000082#WRK04800"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[2855\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000082#WRK04900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which he is satisfied that the action taken by his Department to date remains sufficient to protect Ireland from the double impact of Brexit and Covid-19;

More detailed technical guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the Policy Unit of the Office of Government Procurement (OGP)<\/p>  <p>  To create a level playing field for all businesses across Europe, EU law sets out minimum harmonised public procurement rules. These rules govern the way public authorities and certain utility operators purchase goods, works and services. The rules are set out in three principal EU Directives which are transposed into national legislation and apply to tenders for public contracts whose monetary value exceeds certain thresholds. For tenders of lower value, national rules apply, which must also respect the general principles of EU law.<\/p>  <p>  All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).\u00a0 The CWMF is a structure that has been developed to deliver the Government&rsquo;s objectives in relation to public sector construction procurement reform. It consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts, generic template documents and procedures that cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their procurement requirements.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the CWMF commenced in March 2019 and is ongoing. The focus of the review is on improving the delivery of construction projects in terms of quality, timely delivery and cost outcomes. The Review process involves extensive engagement both with industry and public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues including the deployment of digital technologies, enhanced risk management and information management for public bodies, contractors and consultants.<\/p>  <p>  To mitigate the impact of the necessary public health measures on the delivery of projects under the NDP, a series of COVID-19 notes were published during the period March 2020 to July 2021.\u00a0 These included guidance notes, supplemental agreements for site closures and ex-gratia scheme, and a COVID-19 Mandatory Closure clause in Public Works Contracts.<\/p>  <p>  Engagement with the insurance sector and construction industry stakeholders has also taken place on issues relating to cost increases on Professional Indemnity Insurance premiums and the reduction in cover available.\u00a0 Amendments to CWMF documents and additional guidance will be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Significant increases in construction material costs is impacting live tenders and contracts. Interim measures to address the impact of the cost increases on Public Works Projects have been introduced. Procurement guidance for &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders was published in November 2021. Interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts were published in January 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Together these reform processes will lead to meaningful policy change and will assist in delivering better value for money for the taxpayer in the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The NPPPF also supports contracting authorities when awarding contracts for goods and services, including the Office of Government Procurement, four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and private entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body,\u00a0 and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My officials are\u00a0currently finalising a review of the Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Service which were last updated in 2019 to take account of new developments in the area of procurement and clarification of some aspects of the Guidelines. In addition, an updated Brexit Information Note was published in July 2021 and an updated COVID Information Note was published in September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Work has been undertaken by the OGP to ensure that the opportunity to compete in public procurement is accessible by all businesses, including SMEs. Specifically, the OGP has developed a suite of policy measures aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities (implemented through Circular 10\/2014: Initiatives to assist SMEs in public procurement). These include:<\/p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial\u00a0capacity\u00a0criterion (turnover requirements limited to\u00a0twice the\u00a0contract value);<\/p>  <p>  - Contracting authorities are encouraged to divide\u00a0public contracts\u00a0into lots;<\/p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia\u00a0bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs\u00a0to\u00a0participate in procurement procedures where\u00a0they would\u00a0not have\u00a0the\u00a0relevant capability or scale;<\/p>  <p>  - Proportionate insurance levels; and<\/p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.<\/p>  <p>  The SME Advisory Group meets quarterly and ensures that the voice of Irish SMEs (through the industry representative bodies ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF)\u00a0is heard by Government. Furthermore, the OGP operates the Tender Advisory Service, an informal service provided free of charge, to facilitate suppliers to raise concerns in relation to live tender processes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to proactively review the National Public Procurement Policy Framework periodically, update as appropriate and communicate changes to relevant\u00a0stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000082#WRK05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":479,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000083#WRL00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000083#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[1443\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000083#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the measures being taken by her Department to support the promotion of the Irish language in national and local systems of administration; if her Department retains data on the number of complaints or communications made to her Department by persons who were unable to access national or local systems of administration through the medium of the Irish language; the details of same if such data is retained; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>The rights of all citizens to access State services through the medium of Irish are covered by the Official Languages Acts 2003 to 2021. <\/p><p>The 2021 Act is a strengthening of the Official Languages Act 2003 and it is widely recognised that it will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the quality of services in Irish provided to the public by State bodies.<\/p><p>The main provisions of this Act include: <\/p><p>- A target of 20% of new recruits to the public service being  competent in Irish by the end of 2030,<\/p><p>- Confirmation that a deadline will be set by which all public services will be available in Irish in the Gaeltacht,<\/p><p>- A commitment that all public offices in the Gaeltacht will operate through the medium of Irish, <\/p><p>- A provision placing an obligation on public bodies to make marketing material available in Irish,<\/p><p>- A provision to ensure that communications with a public body on social media are answered in the same official language.<\/p><p>Officials of my Department have already commenced work to give effect to the provisions of the new Act and to work towards the development of a National Plan for the Provision of Public Services in Irish. <\/p><p>Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to complaints by persons who are unable to access national or local systems of administration through the medium of Irish, I can confirm that this is a matter for the Office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, established under the 2003 Act.<\/p><p>The primary functions of the Office are to monitor compliance by public bodies with the provisions of the Act and to take appropriate measures to ensure such compliance.

In the pursuit of that objective, we are committed to a Sport for All approach aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027, and will be essential to achieve the target of 60% of the population participating in sport and physical activity.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023, which includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board including an Innovation Fund to promote innovative collaborative projects aimed at increasing sustainable participation in sport, an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund, and a youth-centred stakeholder forum to guide the adoption of the strategic framework recommended in the Children&rsquo;s Sport Participation and Physical Activity Study 2018. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in other funding streams provided by my Department.\u00a0 For example, Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  One of the key aims of the national sports policy is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport support entirely by 2027. The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor, ISM, report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years. Unfortunately, while the ISM report for the first quarter of 2021 showed that the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest ISM figures for quarter 3 showed that the gender gap was beginning to re-emerge as Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. In quarter 3 of 2021, male sport participation had returned to pre-pandemic levels, at 48%, while female participation was 38%, 7% behind the level measured in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The emerging gradient is a cause for focus, concern and ongoing monitoring. It is now crucial that we move to ensure that the gap is narrowed and closed. To this end, many governing bodies will begin to deliver women in sport in dormant accounts funding programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have disproportionately been impacted by the pandemic, including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities. <\/p>  <p>  These targeted activities form part of a winter initiative for sport to kickstart participation following the reduction in restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its\u00a0Participation Plan 2021-2024\u00a0&ndash;\u00a0Increasing Participation in Changing Ireland. The Participation Plan outlines how Sport Ireland will continue to help people get active by removing barriers to participation in sport and physical activity in the coming years. The Sport Ireland Participation Plan actions will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies, strategic partners, clubs, communities and individuals. <\/p>  <p>  The Sport Ireland Participation Plan is built on, and guided by, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 (NSP) and the Sport Ireland Strategy 2018-2022. The Participation Plan takes into consideration Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013&ndash;2025 and the National Physical Activity Plan as well as global and national developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000083#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[2505\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000083#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her strategy to promote participation in creative life amongst older members of communities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my department to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. \u00a0Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.<\/p>  <p>  Under its Creative Communities initiative, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022. \u00a0These strategies were developed following extensive local public consultation, and are unique to each local authority reflecting the strategic priorities identified by the local community - including in relation to older people.\u00a0 These community-led strategies (which can encompass creative engagement with older people) has delivered nearly &euro;13.5 million investment to local authorities in four years including, for example, over &euro;870,000 in funding to local authorities in Carlow and Kilkenny.<\/p>  <p>  During 2020, the adverse impacts of the pandemic on the wellbeing of older people became particularly apparent.

From 11 January 2021 until schools reopened on 12 April 2021, all students, including students who are due to sit the Junior Cycle state examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools.<\/p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context.<\/p>  <p>  The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools in 2020 and 2021, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.<\/p>  <p>  My Department put a series of measures in place to assist schools in mitigating the impact of the school closures.\u00a0 During the period of school closure, schools were required to implement a plan of action to enable continuity of learning for all pupils.\u00a0 This involved teachers, including special education teachers, providing remote teaching and learning to all pupils in their class or on their caseload.<\/p>  <p>  In September of 2021, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published revised arrangements for the completion of Classroom Based Assessments for students in 3rd year in 2021\/2022 (cohort of students 2019 &ndash; 2022). These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 and 2020\/21 school year. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice in and reducing the number of Classroom-Based Assessments. The revised arrangements also remove the requirement for an Assessment Task to be completed.<\/p>  <p>  The adjustments were arrived at through consultation between my Department and the\u00a0NCCA and key stakeholders.\u00a0These revised arrangements are available here: ncca.ie\/en\/resources\/revised-arrangements-for-the-completion-of-classroom-based-assessments-cbas-in-school-year-20212022-1\/ <\/p>  <p>  Junior Cycle papers are structured to reflect the learning outcomes based approach to the design of the subject specifications. This means that the elements are used to integrate the strands of the specifications resulting in assessments that require students to apply knowledge and skills acquired rather than examinations that depend on knowledge recall only.\u00a0Candidates are required to answer all questions and no choice is provided. Questions are not of equal length or marks. Making any changes to the format of the papers would undermine the approach taken by teachers in developing units of learning that mediate the curriculum specifications.<\/p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools. The assessment arrangements also provide progression opportunities for students who intend to pursue paths outside of school after Junior Cycle, such as those who may enter apprenticeships.<\/p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission will issue further details regarding the 2022 examinations. All aspects of the examinations will be conducted in accordance with the prevailing Public Health advice.<\/p>  <p>  It is planned that the Junior Cycle Music practical performance test and the Home Economics practical test will take place during school time as normal.<\/p>  <p>  By way of further information, my Department has provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context.

OMCs must set annual service charge schemes to cover the costs of maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas under its controls and the provision of common services to unit owners. The OMC must establish a sinking fund, and OMCs can also develop house rules for the operation and maintenance of their multi-unit development.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to annual service charges, it is a matter for each individual OMC to determine the amount of the service charge on an annual basis. Section 18 of the Act requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units in the development, including insurance, waste management and security services. The Act sets out clearly that the service charge must be calculated on a transparent basis, and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to meetings, Section 17 (1) (b) of the Act requires the OMC to hold a meeting at least once a year where they are obliged to present annual report.

These obligations are in addition to any other obligation or duty such a company would have under legislation such as, the Companies Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Section 24 of the Act contains provisions for the resolution of disputes relating to multi-unit developments. It provides that a person, including any member of an OMC, may apply to the Circuit Court for an Order to enforce any rights conferred or obligations imposed by the Act. The Court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation. The Act also contains provisions which encourage the resolution of disputes that may arise between parties by means of mediation rather than recourse to court proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, statutory provisions governing the regulation of companies, including those concerning the memorandum and articles of association, the appointment and responsibilities of directors and requirements for submitting annual financial returns, are set out in the Companies Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000086#WRO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":678,"content":"<p>Question No. 263 answered with Question No. 262.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":679,"content":"<p>Question No. 264 answered with Question No. 262.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":680,"content":"<p>Question No. 265 answered with Question No. 262.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":681,"content":"<p>Question No. 266 answered with Question No. 262.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equality Issues","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000086#WRO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[2873\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000086#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which she can ensure a fair and even balance between the right to freedom of expression and the rejection of xenophobia; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":684,"content":"<p>The right to freedom of expression is a fundamental right, enshrined in our Constitution and in the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>Though fundamental, this right is not absolute and can be limited or restricted by law for compelling reasons, including protecting other fundamental human rights.

Additionally, increased budget allocations have been secured this year in order to address such heinous and unacceptable behaviour.<\/p><p>As you may be aware, I am currently leading work on a new whole of government strategy to combat domestic, sexual, gender-based violence. This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in our society for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p><p>The Strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out. The Deputy may be interested to know that Safe Ireland is one of two NGOs (the other is the National Women's Council of Ireland) that my Department has partnered with to provide expert support in relation to the development of the Strategy. This included examining how progress on actions is identified and reported, analysis of progress to date and of possible priority issues to be addressed, how drafting of actions should be approached, expert advice on moving to an outcome-focused framework, expert advice on the development of a prevention focused Strategy and support for wider public consultation. The process has been supported by external consultants, overseen and directed by an executive group consisting of the Department of Justice, the NWCI, and Safe Ireland.<\/p><p>The new Strategy will be structured around the four pillars or goals of the Istanbul Convention which are <\/p><p>- Prevention<\/p><p>- Protection<\/p><p>- Prosecution<\/p><p>- Co-ordinated Policies<\/p><p>Under each of these high level objectives there will be a number of specific aims listed but the Strategy and aims will be high level in tone and content. <\/p><p>A detailed action plan setting out how each of these aims will be achieved, who is responsible for them and the timeframe for delivery is currently being drafted with the sector so that it is targeted, ambitious and deliverable.<\/p><p>In the coming weeks, I will be inviting feedback through a focused consultation process on the final draft to ensure the Strategy is correctly emphasising the areas that people feel need the most attention. <\/p><p>I expect to bring the finalised strategy to Government in March, and I will oversee the implementation of the strategy. <\/p><p>Last year, on foot of the audit, it was agreed that the Department of Justice will continue to have lead policy responsibility for DSGBV.<\/p><p>My Department will also assume responsibility for services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, in addition to policy responsibility.<\/p><p>A detailed plan for how this will work is in preparation and will be brought to Government for decision.<\/p><p>Also this year, I will be introducing legislation to strengthen the law in a number of areas.<\/p><p>The new Garda Powers Bill will provide a clear and transparent statutory basis for the existing police powers of search, arrest and detention.<\/p><p>The Digital Recordings Bill provides for the necessary modern technology in the investigation of serious crime<\/p><p>Before Easter, I will publish a Bill which will include new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation.<\/p><p>The act of stalking itself is already covered by existing law, but I will propose the following changes to make the law clearer and stronger:<\/p><p>Explicitly reference stalking as a criminal offence;<\/p><p>- Make it clear that stalking includes watching or following a victim, even where they are not aware of being watched or followed;<\/p><p>- Make it clear that impersonating the victim, and then communicating with a third party, is illegal;<\/p><p>- Update the law to ensure that it covers all forms of modern communications.<\/p><p>- I will also consider introducing a provision to allow a victim, in very serious cases, apply to the court for an order to prevent the alleged perpetrator from communicating with them in advance of a trial. <\/p><p>While choking and non-fatal strangulation are already illegal, creating a new, standalone offence should encourage victims to come forward and report what has happened to them.<\/p><p>It has been shown that this crime can be an indication of future, lethal violence and is a risk factor for homicides against women in the home.<\/p><p>In the Summer, I will publish a new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender.<\/p><p>Before the end of September, I will publish a new Sexual Offences Bill, which will introduce important changes including:<\/p><p>Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims<\/p><p>Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public<\/p><p>Legal representation for victims<\/p><p>I will also seek to enact the Sex Offenders Bill within months to strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community.<\/p><p>Within the coming weeks, I will sign an order to bring into operation legislation which provides for pre-trial hearings, which will significantly improve the trial process for victims of sexual offences.<\/p><p>This is an area of work I have prioritised since becoming Minister for Justice, but I know much more needs to be done, and I'm determined to do much more.

for serious diet-related noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, and certain forms of cancer. It&rsquo;s health consequences range from increased risk of premature death to serious chronic conditions that reduce the overall quality of life. <\/p><p>In Ireland 23% of the adult population are obese with 37% being overweight. In addition, 1 in 5 children are categorised as overweight or obese. <\/p><p>Obesity is a complex and multi-faceted problem, and the Department of Health&rsquo;s Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP) recognises this and that it needs a multi-pronged solution, with every sector of society playing its part.  An important strand of the OPAP relates to communications. Step 4 of the OPAP is to Implement a strategic and sustained communications strategy that empowers individuals, communities and service providers to become obesity aware and equipped to change, with a particular focus on families with children in the early years.  Action under this heading has included the funding for the START public health childhood obesity campaign (www.safefood.net\/start) and the currently running Healthy Ireland Let&rsquo;s Get Set campaign (www.gov.ie\/letsgetset ), which encourages us all to set a healthy routine<\/p><p>The Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan, which is a Government of Ireland initiative, requires us to empower people to better look after their own health and wellbeing, to help prevent ill-health and to keep themselves well.  Our goal through Healthy Ireland is to inspire and support behavioural change and to engage citizens in bringing this change about.<\/p><p>Operation Transformation encourages the Irish public to get active and get healthy. Over the course of the 8-week show it gives the nation the tools they need to get moving, eat healthily and improve overall wellbeing.<\/p><p>Healthy Ireland sponsored Operation Transformation in 2021 as part of the Government &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; resilience campaign and as part of its obligations under Step 4 of the OPAP. Whilst the sponsorship does not confer editorial control it does allow Healthy Ireland work with the producers and recommend or weave in themes and messages on health topics, which are not confined to healthy eating and physical activity. <\/p><p>The Department of Health commissioned an independent quantitative market research exercise to provide some metrics, based on people&rsquo;s responses in the immediate aftermath of the series.  This confirmed, among other findings, that almost three quarters of respondents who watched the show said that they had made one or more positive lifestyle changes as a result of watching the show, including one third who replied that they were eating healthier food.  Importantly, the vast majority of those said that they were likely to continue with the health behaviour changes that they had made.  Also, with 63% of viewers stating that they have made the changes with their household or family, this demonstrates that the impact is much wider that just the one viewer but rather the entire household.  <\/p><p>In 2021, an average of 469,000 viewers watched Operation Transformation each week, and sponsorship of this flagship RTE programme creates an enormous opportunity for Healthy Ireland to promote trusted information and resources on how to enjoy good physical and mental health.<\/p><p>In the current series we have seen the leaders start their journey to adopt healthy habits, under the supervision of a GP, a clinical psychologist, a nutritionist and a personal trainer. Linkages to the HSE&rsquo;s Quit (smoking) Programme, opening the conversation around grief and menopause are all important messages that are being delivered as part of the series. There has also been a big focus on community, with a piece showcasing the &ldquo;Men on the Move&rdquo; programme. <\/p><p>The &ldquo;Ireland Lights Up&rdquo; initiative has also returned with the launch being included from Croke Park. At present over 700 GAA clubs have signed up and opened their clubs to allow communities to come together and walk in safe environment. This is particularly important on the dark January nights in rural areas, where there often are not any areas that are lit up to allow for safe exercise for the individuals and the community.

To adapt and improve accessibility, Mental Health Services and many of its funded NGO partners, successfully fast-tracked new digital health options including innovative online, text and phone supports. Telehealth services are now fully established and are provided as part of a blended service delivery, the majority of which are available seven days per week, with some providing 24-hour support. 7-day telehealth services include YourMentalHealth.ie, the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis textline 50808 and NGO partners&rsquo; online supports (details of each can be found on yourmentalhealth.ie).<\/p><p>The HSE recently partnered with SilverCloud, on the national roll out of\u00a0digital cognitive behavioural therapy  (links.uk.defend.egress.com\/Warning?crId=615f0e0d8018f31fc6b588b9&amp;amp;Domain=health.gov.ie&amp;amp;Base64Url=eNo9ykEKgDAMBdETpQGX3ibi15SmpZhArm83up15GjF9Z87MraijVHDC7EAdN3eMECOFWCiH4pFZ4bRiW59knOSwawmb_NXfFY1uLxS6JQ4%3D)\u00a0(CBT)\u00a0to address depression and anxiety in Ireland in an effort to make mental health support more widely available. Referrals can be made from Primary Care Psychology, the National Counselling Service, Jigsaw and GPs across Ireland, enabling individuals, including young people to access essential supports within 24 hours of referral.<\/p><p>Last year I launched the Talking Therapies Model of Care, which is delivered by trained therapists. Talking Therapy helps people to better understand their feelings and behaviour in order to make positive changes and improve their lives. In Ireland, we currently offer a range of talking therapies to people experiencing mental health difficulties, in primary care, specialist services and through HSE partner organisations.<\/p><p>Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) continues to be available to adults with medical cards. In December, I announced a significant reduction of over 19% among children and young people under 18 waiting more than 12 months to be seen by Primary Care Psychology following an allocation of &euro;4 million last August to address such lists through targeted initiatives. Work continues on the development of a sustainable Primary Care Psychology Service.<\/p><p>For young people specifically, the HSE continues to work with\u00a0<b>SpunOut.ie<\/b>to provide engaging online mental health content and signposting. Jigsaw also has developed other offerings to support young people, notably through its\u00a0Live Chat\u00a0service.<\/p><p>Dedicated funding was allocated to respond to the challenges of Covid-19, including &euro;2.2 million in 2020, &euro;15 million in 2021 and a further &euro;10 million as part of the Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead Plan. As part of this &euro;10 million a number of initiatives have been identified and are being progressed by HSE Mental Health Services and NGO partners. These include enhanced signposting and access to existing mental health services, increased channels for signposting, increased provision for service delivery, psychosocial response planning at Community Healthcare Organisation level, and initiatives for children and young people of school age, at third level and in non-education settings.<\/p><p>An additional once off &euro;10 million was announced on Budget Day to further support the mental health sector. \u00a0A significant amount of the funding will be used to improve the experiences of people using HSE mental health inpatient units, day centres, community mental health teams and community residences in every community across the country.\u00a0 Almost &euro;3 million will be made available to the community and voluntary sector, including &euro;1 million to NGO partner MyMind.\u00a0 Through this funding, MyMind will\u00a0continue to deliver\u00a0free of charge counselling sessions, in over 15 languages, to clients impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0Up to 16,500 counselling and psychotherapy sessions will be provided, via video or telephone call to individuals. Since 2020, with funding from the Slaintecare Integration Fund, MyMind has delivered over 21,000 appointments.<\/p><p>As part of this funding, Mental Health Ireland will manage a grant scheme on behalf of the Department, providing grants of between &euro;10,000-&euro;30,000 for the development and implementation of locally-led actions from community and voluntary agencies promoting mental health and wellbeing in the context of\u00a0Sharing the Vision\u00a0and\u00a0Connecting for Life.<\/p><p>In addition, the HSE is delivering whole population mental health and well-being services in response to Covid-19 based on the HSE Psychosocial Framework, which is reflective of best international practice. Launched in January 2021, the framework provides a clear plan to build on existing psychosocial supports to the public and healthcare workers, with a co-ordinated, consistent and collaborative approach to mental health services. Supports are provided across five key levels, from mental health promotion to specialist services, during and beyond Covid.<\/p><p>The Government has invested &euro;7 million in the Keep Well campaign to support initiatives with a range of partners, including &lsquo;Keeping In Contact&rsquo; and the Community Call programme aimed at people who might be experiencing isolation and offering befriending services.<\/p><p>More generally but significantly, all aspects of mental health services continue to be improved and developed, through implementation of the national mental health policy Sharing the Vision (StV). The policy aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030.<\/p><p>A negative mental health outcome from the pandemic is not inevitable, if we respond in a cohesive manner.

Over time, some of this work may transition to the local community optometrists, similar to the Sligo model of post-cataract care.<br \/><br \/>- Advance efforts to transfer the care of children aged 8+ years to the care of local private optometrists; a project team was established in late 2019 \/ early 2020 to progress this initiative but it was necessary to pause the project as the HSE concentrated its resources on response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The HSE are committed to bringing the project to conclusion over a 6-to-9-month time frame in 2022. <br \/><br \/>- Creating a new role of Consultant Medical Ophthalmologist, subject to the availability of resources.<br \/><br \/>- Successful recruitment of 1.0 WTE Consultant Medical Ophthalmologist per CHO 6, 7 and 9 to oversee clinical governance in the areas. There is a panel in place to recruit additional Consultant Medical Ophthalmologists to other CHOs and this will be rolled out in line with funding approval.<br \/><br \/>The Department fully supports the development of community services to expand and integrate the provision of eye care in local communities.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000088#WRQ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":814,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000088#WRQ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[2844\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012000088#WRQ04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the implementation of the recommendations of the national youth mental health task force, in particular the youth mental health pathfinder project; if a pathfinder team is now in place; if so, the progress to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":816,"content":"<p>The proposal to establish a cross-governmental youth mental health Pathfinder unit, with participation from the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, received Ministerial approval during the previous Government.

It is the third largest agri-food sector, accounting for 6.3% of the output value of the agri-food sector and generated exports of &euro;893 million in 2020;\u00a0with 2021 figures to end of October at &euro;765 million.\u00a0<\/p><p>The average\u00a0price paid for pigs in Ireland has fallen in recent months, in line with trends across the EU.\u00a0The 2021 average price was 8.71% lower than that of 2020. <\/p><p>The first week of 2022 (w\/e 9<sup>th<\/sup>January) saw the average grade E pig price come in at 142.72 &euro;\/100kg,\u00a0 8.14% lower than the same week last year. However, this is still well above the EU average price of 132.15&euro;\/100kg.<\/p><p>My Department continues to support the Irish pigmeat sector and facilitate its development by prioritising market access, both through maintaining existing markets and pursuing access to new ones.<\/p><p>My colleague, Minister of State\u00a0Martin Heydon chairs the Pig Roundtable, which was established in early 2021, and the next meeting of which will take place next week.
