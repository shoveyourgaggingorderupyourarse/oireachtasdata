I am particularly concerned regarding the humanitarian needs of the population, which are acute.\u00a0Due to the severe lack of access to basic goods, services, medicines and medical equipment, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country is extremely worrying.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the call for international solidarity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. I fully support the calls by the UN Secretary-General and by the EU High Representative Josep Borrell for sanctions regimes to be applied in such a way as not to hinder the provision of essential equipment and supplies to fight COVID-19 and limit its spread. It is important that humanitarian exemptions provided for under UN and EU sanctions regimes are fully availed of and applied in an appropriate and timely manner in light of the current emergency. Through the use of these exemptions, Ireland, as an EU Member State, will play its part to ensure that sanctions do not impede efforts in the global response to COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  We also join the UNSG in urging countries with unilateral sanctions regimes to ensure that these sanctions do not in any way hinder the fight against COVID-19 or impede humanitarian assistance from reaching the most vulnerable.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At this time of global crisis, I believe that a strong multilateral response is essential. In order to contain and fight the virus, nations must work together and enhance international cooperation. For this reason, Ireland is encouraging a UN system-wide response, and we have significantly increased our financial support by quadrupling funding to the World Health Organisation for 2020. We have allocated over &euro;115 million to the global COVID-19 response, and have pledged an additional &euro;18 million in support to GAVI for the 2021-25 period. Ireland is also proud to contribute to the European Union&rsquo;s global response to COVID-19, which has mobilised almost &euro;36 billion to date.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased that Ireland participated in the International Donors Conference in solidarity with Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the midst of COVID-19 that took place on 26 May, co-hosted by Spain and the EU and convened in collaboration with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Ireland pledged &euro;1 million in 2020 to the UNHCR and IOM Regional Response Plan for Venezuelan migrants and refugees.<\/p>  <p>  As I said in my statement that I issued on the occasion of the Solidarity Conference, it is more important than ever for us to demonstrate the values of solidarity and our shared humanity. We know that the impact of this crisis will not fall equally, but will disproportionately impact those already suffering from humanitarian crises, including in situations of displacement, conflict or natural disaster.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the correspondence which the Deputy mentions, this was received by my Department, along with subsequent other linked correspondence, regarding the situation in Venezuela, and a composite reply issued on 9 June.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation in the country closely and engage with my EU colleagues and other key interlocutors on this important issue.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":46,"content":"<p>Question No. 16 answered with Question No. 12.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[13522\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the recent infringement by Poland on LGBTQ rights and attempts to classify LGBT as an ideology.","asker":"1525","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>I am concerned regarding developments relating to LGBTI+ rights in Poland.

It would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland, or by the international community more generally.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will not give up on the Two State solution as long as that is the objective of the parties themselves, but annexation would without doubt threaten that prospect, and seriously undermine efforts to find a negotiated solution that respects the legitimate positions of both parties.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As I stated publicly on 23 April: \"I think it important, as a friend and partner of Israel, to be very clear about the gravity of any such step.\u00a0Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter, whenever and wherever it occurs, in Europe&rsquo;s neighbourhood or globally. This is a fundamental principle in the relations of States and the rule of law in the modern world. No one State can set it aside at will.\"\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have in the past made my views on this clear to Israeli leaders, including during my most recent visit to Israel in December 2019, and my officials continue to convey our views to the Israeli authorities. I have also raised this issue in discussions with US representatives, and underlined my serious concerns about possible annexation.<\/p>  <p>  I, and senior officials in my Department, have also highlighted the issue with a large number of EU Member States, to encourage a clear and united position. When this was discussed at the 15 May video conference meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, there was broad agreement that the EU and its Member States should convey these concerns directly to the new Israeli Government.\u00a0That outreach is ongoing. I welcome the very clear statements that have been made on this matter by EU High Representative \/ Vice President Josep Borrell, who has said that any annexation could not pass unchallenged. Annexation would inevitably have negative consequences for the EU-Israel relationship.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also taken opportunities to raise this issue at the UN, including in Ireland&rsquo;s statements to the UN Security Council on 23 April 2020, and the Human Rights Council on 15 June 2020.

No two conflicts are the same and each needs to be approached with an understanding of root causes and contributory factors.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the mandate of the Security Council as the principal organ charged with the maintenance of international peace and security, I would highlight three overarching principles that will guide our approach to the Council's work. <\/p>  <p>  The first is building peace, including championing the UN's role in peacekeeping, reinforcing the link between peacekeeping and peace-building, and further developing cooperation on peace and security between the UN and regional organisations, including the African Union. We need to ensure that peace is inclusive and fully involves civil society, particularly women and young people.<\/p>  <p>  The second is preventing conflict.

The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).\u00a0 The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.

Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the objective of getting assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus.<\/p><p>In the context of the compelling need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.  The key conditions of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash;<\/p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,<\/p><p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and <\/p><p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, but extended recently to 1 April 2020.<\/p><p>The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  The wage subsidy per employee is calculated based on the net pay reported for January and February 2020. It follows that the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after that date, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, he or she does not meet the eligibility criteria with the employer as he or she would not have been on the employer&rsquo;s payroll at that date. There are no plans at the present moment to revisit the core criteria. <\/p><p>The Deputies will be aware that the Government decided on 5 June 2020 to extend the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) until the end of August.The intention is to continue to monitor the scheme closely in the coming period.<\/p><p>The new Programme for Government contains a commitment that a July Jobs Initiative will be brought forward which will, among other things, &quot;set out a pathway for the future implementation of the Temporary Wage Subsidy&quot;.  The matter raised by the Deputies will be one of the many factors that will be taken into account as part of that exercise.<\/p><p>In relation to other direct support measures, I would draw the Deputies' attention to a recent publication by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which outlines the key financial supports and resources that are being made available to help all businesses and sectors impacted by Covid-19.

I presume that the Deputy is referring to the 2012 set of UN Guiding Principles on Foreign Debt and Human Rights, endorsed by resolution (A\/HRC\/RES\/20\/10) obliging governments (lenders and borrowers) to ensure the primacy of human rights when they make lending and borrowing decisions.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity that the Deputy&rsquo;s question affords me to clarify the richness of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with International Financial Institutions. While the role of the IMF is probably most often perceived through a fiscal and monetary lens that\u00a0is accordingly associated with economic policy, our international development policy is also an important driver and compass in our engagement with the Institution. Our current whole-of-Government international development strategy, A Better World, is grounded and informed by the overarching principles in the UN&rsquo;s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Echoing the priorities articulated in our international development strategy, Ireland&rsquo;s IMF engagement advocates the promotion and protection of human rights and prioritises gender equality.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the IMF's primary mission is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system. It focuses on achieving sustainable growth and a stable macroeconomic environment, which in themselves are supportive of human rights, while encouraging member Governments and other Agencies to work together towards designing development strategies that take human rights into account. Broadly speaking, many of the Fund&rsquo;s activities &ndash; reducing macroeconomic imbalances and structural bottlenecks; eliminating obstacles to international payments; and preventing financial crises - contribute directly or indirectly to reducing poverty and fostering human rights. However, the IMF recognises that while growth, macroeconomic stability, and a well-functioning international monetary system can contribute to an environment that supports poverty reduction, they cannot, by themselves, eliminate poverty or protect human rights.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund has also acknowledged that it must be aware of any adverse effects of the corrective policy actions required as part of individual IMF programmes. Although the costs of adjustment are inevitable with any programme of financial support, the IMF insists that they need not to fall disproportionately on the poor nor compromise human rights. In some cases, the Fund encourages Governments to introduce appropriate social protection measures to help alleviate adverse social consequences during periods of adjustment. With regard to gender specifically, the IMF has increasingly recognised this as a macro-critical issue, noting that reducing gender gaps can have important economic benefits. Gender informs the Fund&rsquo;s country work both in terms of surveillance and the structural reform commitments required by IMF-supported programmes which aim to promote gender equality. Gender issues are also an integral part of capacity development through technical assistance and training.<\/p>  <p>  The IMF has a system of checks and balances to ensure accountability, ranging from internal and external audits, risk management, and evaluations of its policies and operations. The Fund is also accountable to all 189 member countries through the Board of Governors and the Board of Executive Directors on which all members are represented. The IMF recognises the benefits of a transparent and wide engagement with civil society groups to gather broader perspectives about the impact of the Fund&rsquo;s work and improve policy advice and analysis and has worked to increase dialogue with CSOs. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to assure the Deputy that a commitment to human rights shall remain central to Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with the IMF. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[13635\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB06300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has considered the recommendation of a group (details supplied) which states that the IMF should only be permitted to impose one condition on borrowers, the full repayment within the agreed upon time limit, thus separating the IMF lending and policy advice functions; his views on the recommendation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>As the Minister for Finance is Ireland&rsquo;s Governor to the IMF, I propose to respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s question. I presume that the Recommendations that Deputy Shortall is referring to are those contained in the &ldquo;Unhealthy conditions: IMF loan conditionality and its impact on health financing&rdquo; report published by Eurodad (the European Network on Debt and Development), which\u00a0is a network of 50 civil society organisations (CSOs)\u00a0from 20 European countries. This report outlined an interesting analysis of the impact of certain loan conditionality with a particular focus on health financing. It is timely that the Deputy raises this Report given the imperative for significantly ramping up the requirement for global healthcare financing against a backdrop of severe economic pressures.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0As a recent graduate of a thankfully successful IMF programme ourselves, I can assure the Deputy we are very conscious of the perils of counter-productive conditionality attendant to sovereign financing. \u00a0However, the objective of conditionality is not to penalise those who access IMF financing but rather to create conditions of sustainability and resilience. As I have recently noted, Ireland's reforms and reorientation after the financial crisis has left us in a far better position\u00a0to deal with the range of impacts of the current pandemic crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The IMF's primary mission is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system. This is achieved via:<\/p>  <p>  - Surveillance - monitoring member country policies as well as national, regional, and global economic and financial developments;<\/p>  <p>  - Policy advice - promoting policies designed to foster economic stability, reduce vulnerability to economic and financial crises, and raise living standards;<\/p>  <p>  - Capacity development - providing\u00a0technical assistance and training to help member countries build better economic institutions; and<\/p>  <p>  - Financial assistance - providing loans to member countries that are experiencing actual or potential balance-of-payments problems.<\/p>  <p>  IMF financial assistance is usually provided within the context of individual country adjustment programmes which include a set of corrective policy actions designed to overcome the problems that led the country to seek financial aid. These policy adjustments are an integral part of IMF lending and essential in order to restore sound financial and economic fundamentals and build resilience, thereby avoiding repeated crises and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Fund&rsquo;s members. Commitments to undertake certain policy actions as part of an IMF-supported programme are formulated and agreed in close collaboration with the requesting country&rsquo;s Government. The over-arching goal is always to restore or maintain balance-of-payments viability and macroeconomic stability without resorting to measures that are destructive or harmful to national or international prosperity. These measures are also required to safeguard IMF resources by ensuring that the country&rsquo;s balance of payments will be strong enough to permit it to repay the loan so that these funds can be made available to other member countries in need.<\/p>  <p>  The conditionality of IMF programmes is broadly assessed by the Fund&rsquo;s Executive Board and staff in periodic Reviews of Program Design and Conditionality. The most recent Review in 2018 examined the performance of Fund-supported programmes ongoing between September 2011 and end-2017 and concluded that conditionality was generally well-tailored to country needs and programme objectives. However, the Fund did acknowledge the need for IMF-supported programmes to work in concert with national reform plans; to improve two-way communication with the broader public to support buy-in; and to take institutional and political capacity to deliver programme objectives on a realistic timetable into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the financial assistance provided by the IMF is flexible and responsive. This has been aptly demonstrated over the last few months in the Fund&rsquo;s rapid and comprehensive response to the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. The IMF has played a significant role in providing vital emergency assistance to help members to deal with the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, over 100 of the Fund&rsquo;s 189 members have requested emergency assistance. Of these, 70 requests for emergency financing have been approved for a total of US$ 24.4 billion. Much of this assistance was delivered through emergency financing instruments which focus on providing a fast-disbursement and limited-conditionality emergency response <\/p>  <p>  Indeed, the Deputy will note that the increased use of these flexible instruments with low conditionality is in line with the thrust of the Eurodad Recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB06500"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[12708\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB06600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the due date for inheritance tax 2020 will be deferred from 31 October 2020 in cases in which the inheritance consists of property in order to afford persons time to dispose of the properties in question which was held up due to the Covid-19 crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>The standard rate of Capital Acquisitions Tax is 33%. There are three tax-free thresholds depending on the relationship between the disponer and the beneficiary, with CAT applying on the amount inherited or gifted over the thresholds, as follows:<\/p><p><b>Group A<\/b>threshold (&euro;335,000) - Applies where the beneficiary is a child (including certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.

The balance of gifts or inheritance above the threshold is taxable.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the date on which capital acquisitions tax (CAT) is payable is determined by the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; on which the market value of the property included in a gift or an inheritance must be established. Where this date is between 1 January and 31 August, CAT is payable by 31 October in the same year. Where this date is between 1 September and 31 December, CAT is payable by 31 October in the following year.<\/p><p>Section 30 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 contains the rules for determining the valuation date. The valuation date depends on the circumstances particular to a case and is not a fixed date in relation to all gifts and inheritances. In the case of a gift, the valuation date is generally the date on which the property is given to a beneficiary. In the case of an inheritance, however, it can be earlier as it is the date on which the executors of the will become entitled to retain the property for the benefit of a beneficiary. Generally, this is the date on which probate or administration is granted.<\/p><p>Where the benefit consists of property, it may well be the case that CAT is payable before a beneficiary has received the property due to a delay in completing the administration of an estate. Equally, where a beneficiary has actually received the property, CAT may be payable before a beneficiary has had the opportunity to sell that property and pay the tax liability. Outside of the current COVID-19 circumstances, the length of the conveyancing process is such that it is often the case that a CAT liability arises before a property can be sold to pay that liability. To provide for such situations, taxpayers have a statutory entitlement to payment by instalments in certain circumstances.\u00a0 Monthly instalment payments for up to five years may be allowed subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8%. However, Revenue has discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments over a longer period in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship. <\/p><p>In such circumstances, Revenue also has discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. Revenue will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the gift or inheritance involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB06800"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[12722\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000055#WRB06900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether persons that have received lump sum compensation payments due to medical negligence and are in possession of a tax exemption certificate having paid a 1% Government levy at the outset of investing with a financial institution, should face a further 1% levy should they choose to switch their investment to another institution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1485","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that section 189 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 exempts permanently incapacitated individuals from income tax, pay related social insurance (PRSI), universal social charge and capital gains tax on the income arising and gains accruing from the investment of certain compensation payments.\u00a0 This may be the tax exemption to which the Deputy refers.\u00a0 This exemption does not extend to any other type of charge or levy.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that a stamp duty levy of 1% on certain life assurance premiums paid by Irish policyholders is payable by a life assurance company under section 124B Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.

In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.\u00a0 Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":126,"content":"<p>Question No. 43 answered with Question No. 26.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Compliance","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[12929\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of an appeal by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>I previously dealt with this issue in my reply to Parliamentary Question Dail Question No. 78 (Ref: 10965-20) answered on the 16th June 2020.<\/p><p>Revenue has reconfirmed to me that no interest has been charged in respect of the period that the cheque payment in question remained uncashed. <\/p><p>However, an interest charge remained in respect of the late payment of the liability and it is in this context that Revenue contacted the deceased person&rsquo;s family representatives seeking supporting documentation in respect of the appeal against this charge.<\/p><p>Revenue has confirmed that the required documentation has now been received and the interest on late payment charge has been waived.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[12946\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on matters raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied) in respect of hire purchase insurance claims; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I cannot direct insurers as to the particulars of settlement offers they should either make or accept in settling claims, including for hire purchase insurance claims, as that is a decision for them considering the merits and specifics of each individual case.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to understand the nature of such Hire Purchase insurance claims, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland (the representative body for insurance providers in this country).\u00a0 In their reply, Insurance Ireland stated that when a vehicle is written off due to an accident or is stolen and not recovered the insurance company will make a settlement based on the value of the car (referred to as total loss settlement). \u00a0However, if the car is under finance, there may be a difference between the value of the car at the time of the loss and the total amount of finance owed under the finance agreement (often this is impacted by the depreciation of the car and interest rate attached to the credit facility amongst other factors). \u00a0They confirmed that the insured loss is the value of the car at the time of the loss not the total amount of finance (including any deposit paid for the car), and that it is very likely that the cost of finance outstanding on a car will be considerably in excess of the value of the car.\u00a0 They mentioned that this is particularly the case when there is also a requirement for a final payment included in the finance contract.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland also noted that there are insurance products available, which are referred to as GAP (Guaranteed Asset Price) or RTI (Return to Invoice) insurance, which compensate the customer for the gap between the value of the car at the time of the loss and the cost to replace the car. \u00a0However, they noted that this cover does not tend to be sold as part of a traditional motor policy, instead they are sold by the finance providers (in many instances these will be vehicle manufacturers and retailers). Therefore, Insurance Ireland advises that consumers review the finance documentation they received when they purchased the finance for the car with a view to understanding if they were offered GAP cover and if the potential risks associated with same was explained to them at the time of purchasing the finance.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, it is worth recalling that the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code was introduced in 2006 and revised in 2012.\u00a0 It requires firms to act honestly fairly and professionally in the best interest of consumers, and to act with due care and diligence.\u00a0 The Code contains specific requirements in respect of the handing of claims, such as requiring firms to have certain procedures in place as well as requirements around the provision of information to consumers on claims.\u00a0 While the Central Bank of Ireland does not adjudicate on individual consumer complaints, the Code sets out how a regulated entity must engage with a consumer on complaints, which includes complaints around the handing of insurance claims.<\/p>  <p>  In situations where a person is not satisfied with the actions of an insurance provider in terms of the settlement of a claim, it is advisable that that person make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.\u00a0 The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes, which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. \u00a0The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie\u00a0or by telephone at 01-5677000. \u00a0Investigations by the FSPO are free of charge to the complainant.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, Insurance Ireland also operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance, which can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[12994\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000056#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address concerns raised by a person (details supplied) in relation to their mortgage application and the subsequent knock-on effects of being placed on the temporary wage subsidy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>As you will be aware both officials and myself have engaged and will continue to engage extensively with the Banking and Payments Federation (BPFI) and the banks directly in relation to supports for personal and business customers affected by the COVID-19 crisis.

There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore as Minister for Finance I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding.

As of 18 June 551,800 employees have received a subsidy since the start of the Scheme, 232,400 employees received a subsidy in the previous week and an estimated 410,000 employees were being supported by the Scheme having received a subsidy in their most recent pay period.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst I completely acknowledge the seriousness of the issue you have raised and its impact on those affected, what I cannot do is mandate how temporary payments received under the Wage Subsidy Scheme are treated in lending sustainability evaluations by regulators and lenders.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The banking crisis we faced over ten years ago was fuelled by unsustainable lending. There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore as Minister for Finance I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding.

In view of this, I and my officials have been engaging with the insurance industry through Insurance Ireland in regards to forbearance measures particularly for business customers.\u00a0 In addition, the Deputy will be aware that at a meeting on 17 April with Insurance Ireland, I called on insurers to be pro-active and generous in relation to their treatment of motor insurance customers during this period. In this regard, I pointed out that a combination of the very profitable part of this market over the last 12 months and what is likely to be a significant reduction in claims for this period due to the travel restrictions that are in place, provided a strong case for premium refunds, thus providing some financial relief to their customers.<\/p>  <p>  On 24 April, Insurance Ireland announced that a number of their members (Allianz, AXA, FBD, RSA and Zurich) had signed up to commitments on premium reliefs for motor customers.\u00a0 In addition, Liberty Insurance wrote to me directly informing me of discounts that they would apply to their customers. \u00a0It is important to note that each insurer has a different mix of customers and different claims experience and that the financial supports, such as refunds or discounts, applied by each insurance company will reflect their own individual claims experience to date. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the response by the insurance industry to date, Insurance Ireland wrote to me on 25 May in respect of this and other commitments made by the insurance sector. \u00a0In relation to motor insurance refunds, they outlined that six general insurance companies had, in May 2020, announced refunds in premiums to Irish motor insurance customers totalling &euro;54.5 million. \u00a0I welcome the announcements as they are a step in the right direction.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that some have expressed disappointment over the level and manner of refunds and\/or discounts. \u00a0In this regard, it would appear that insurers have applied a flat rate across all policyholders rather than looking at the situation in a more granular fashion. \u00a0For instance, a strong case can be made that those who have been cocooning deserved a larger refund, due to their cars being off the road altogether. \u00a0However, the methodology of the premium relief process is a matter outside of my control and it is important to note that each insurance company will make their own decisions as to the level and manner of financial supports, including whether to issue refunds and\/or discounts based on their own particular circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would also stress the need for other insurers operating in the Irish motor insurance market who have not yet made such premium relief announcements to do so, as there is a need by all players in the market to take a longer-term perspective in relation to their customers.\u00a0 I believe customers will remember and favour those companies in the future that have made steps towards meeting their needs at this difficult time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[13355\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 89, 91, 107, 131 and 142 of 16 June 2020, if he will consider reducing the VAT on yoga services to the permissible 12% under the requirements of the EU VAT directive in order to assist yoga studios nationwide post-Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[13644\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason gyms are paying a 9% VAT rate while yoga studios pay a 13.5% rate; the supports he will put in place to help yoga studios reopen in view of the reduction in class sizes that will be necessary to maintain physical distancing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":177,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 77 together.<\/p>  <p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

However I am not in a position to adjudicate as it is very much a matter for the insurer based on the merits and specifics of each case.<\/p>  <p>  For instance, on a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.\u00a0 For example, in relation to commercial vehicle insurance, factors may include those such as the age and type of vehicle, how and where it is used, the claims record, the number of drivers, and the storage and use of the vehicle. Insurers also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and do not all use the same combination of rating factors, so as a result prices vary across the market.\u00a0 While I cannot comment on the specific case referenced in the details supplied, a number of these factors may be influencing the reasons why the terms may change upon renewal. As I have consistently stated, it is my view that it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies in order to achieve a lower price where possible.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes in her question, the forbearance agreement entered into by the relevant insurers is voluntary. \u00a0As a result, neither I, nor the Central Bank, can enforce any of its provisions nor adjudicate on elements of it. \u00a0Nonetheless, I expect insurers to act in line with the principles of the agreement. Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, I asked Insurance Ireland to put in place a mechanism which provides proof of delivery.\u00a0 My Department received the first &ldquo;Activity Report&rdquo; on this issue from Insurance Ireland on 25 May. \u00a0This Report shows that in the period 23 March to 4 May, Insurance Ireland members processed 4,093 forbearance requests for business customers worth a total of &euro;5,242,349. \u00a0My officials have sought more detailed information from Insurance Ireland on the nature of the forbearance being offered, as I want to be certain that they are adhering to the spirit of the commitment they entered into. \u00a0It should also be noted that my Department is in regular touch with the Alliance for Insurance Reform on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that if a consumer has a problem with the service provided by their insurance provider, it is advisable that that they make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.\u00a0 The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).\u00a0 The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wage Subsidy Scheme","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[13365\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the calculation of average net weekly pay for the purposes of the temporary wage subsidy scheme may cause an underpayment to some persons that are usually paid monthly (details supplied); if adjustments are planned to rectify the underpayment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.\u00a0 Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the objective of getting assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The amount of subsidy payable to eligible employees is based on their &lsquo;average revenue net weekly pay&rsquo; (ARNWP) for January and February 2020, as returned by the employer to Revenue through the real-time PAYE system.

A repayment of contributions is only permitted in highly limited circumstances, for example due to ill-health, and as such, this would be subject to income tax. <\/p><p>The policy rationale underpinning\u00a0this is that the State provides generous tax relief on both pension contributions and\u00a0fund growth to ensure that people have sufficient savings to fund their regular costs and expenses during their retirement. However, on actual drawdown a pension is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal tax rate. In the event of any early encashment of a pension fund the\u00a0tax relief received must be clawed back. It should also be noted that any refund of pension contributions is governed by the terms of the specific scheme or product.<\/p><p>As is the case with all matters of policy, while they are monitored on a continuous basis, I do not have any plan at this time to revise these pension arrangements.<\/p><p>It is important to point out that a very significant and comprehensive package of measures has already been put in place to assist those who have suffered a loss of income arising from the COVID-19 crisis.

Information in respect of these trends is captured in the annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) produced\u00a0by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).The most recent 2018 SILC data indicates that the median household disposable income was &euro;42,183, while the mean household disposable income was &euro;50,640. <\/p><p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s query concerning the percentage of households that have higher incomes and assets compared to 2005, I am advised by the CSO that SILC data cannot precisely identify the income of the same cohort of households as in 2005. I am further advised by the CSO that information on asset holdings contained in the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCF)\u00a0does not pre-date 2013. Therefore it is not possible to identify the assets held by households in 2005 and compare those to household assets held in 2018.<\/p><p>With regards to the poverty indicators that the Deputy has requested, these are also available through the published SILC data. SILC produces three metrics for measuring poverty. Those &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of poverty, are\u00a0identified as those living below 60% of median equivalised disposable income. In this instance, the equivalised disposable income refers to the total disposable income of each household divided by the equivalised household size. This may also be referred to as relative poverty. <\/p><p>On the other hand, the measurement for &lsquo;enforced deprivation&rsquo; refers to households that are considered to be deprived because they cannot afford two or more of the eleven goods and services which are considered to be the\u00a0norm for other people in society. This is a measurement for absolute poverty. <\/p><p>Furthermore, the &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; rate measures those who are both &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of poverty and experiencing &lsquo;enforced deprivation'. The data for 2005, 2010, and 2015 as requested\u00a0are provided in the table below. \u00a0The &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of poverty rate and the &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; rate both declined from 2005 to 2010, while the &lsquo;deprivation rate&rsquo; increased in that time period.

The current restrictions, which have not changed since the impact of Covid-19, comprise\u00a0an LTI limit of\u00a03.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income;\u00a0in respect of the\u00a0LTV limit, for first time primary dwelling borrowers it\u00a0is 90% of the value of the residential property and\u00a080% for second and subsequent buyers (for buy to let mortgage borrowers the LTV limit is\u00a070%). <\/p>  <p>  However, the macro-prudential mortgage lending framework also provides a certain\u00a0allowance or discretion to\u00a0lender\u00a0to\u00a0exceed these LTI\u00a0and LTV limits.\u00a0For example, in any one calendar year, lenders can give an LTV allowance to:<\/p>  <p>  - Up to 5% of the\u00a0value of mortgages to first time primary dwelling buyers<\/p>  <p>  - Up to 20% of the\u00a0value of mortgages to second and subsequent primary dwelling buyers<\/p>  <p>  - Up to 10% of the\u00a0value of mortgages to buy-to-let buyers.<\/p>  <p>  In addition,\u00a0the mortgage lending measures\u00a0provide that borrowers who are currently in negative equity and want to move home by purchasing another property are exempt from the LTV limits.<\/p>  <p>  However, the utilisation and allocation of these exemption allowances is solely a matter for individual lenders, having regard to the lender&rsquo;s own credit policies and based on an evaluation of each specific borrower.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, subject to compliance with this macro prudential residential mortgage lending framework, and also to compliance with all the other relevant legal and regulatory requirements governing the provision of mortgage credit to consumers including the relevant provisions of the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016\u00a0and the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012\u00a0&lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; obligations, it remains a matter for each mortgage lender to set its own mortgage lending policies and to make its own mortgage lending decisions in individual cases and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard.\u00a0 Nevertheless, it should also be noted that the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, my Department maintains close contact with the Central Bank and\u00a0Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland\u00a0as the lending industry works\u00a0to address the\u00a0difficulties the COVID-19 situation is causing for both borrowers and lenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wage Subsidy Scheme","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD04500"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[13624\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a temporary wage subsidy scheme application by a person (details supplied) will be re-examined due to an error.","asker":"1560","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is a fully automated solution that is dependent on timely payroll data being provided by employers to Revenue through the real-time PAYE reporting system in accordance with legislative obligations.

I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst I have no legal authority to compel an insurer to pay a claim as this forms part of a contract between the insurer and the policyholder, I believe that as a general rule insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.\u00a0 I believe that they should \u00a0engage with those businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. The Deputy should note however that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank have any role in adjudicating on such matters.\u00a0 If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or litigation.<\/p>  <p>  The above said however, my officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much-needed certainty for business policyholders. On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on 27 March and indicated amongst other things that<\/p>  <p>  (i)  insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage; and,<\/p>  <p>  (ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on 3 April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close. \u00a0Following on from this correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on 17 April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the Central Bank wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. This included the Bank&rsquo;s belief that while most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. The Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of meeting again with\u00a0industry, my officials are in regular contact with Insurance Ireland on the above matters and are keeping me updated on developments. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is also worth noting I have also held two meetings with the Alliance of Insurance Reform, the latest meeting which took place on 17 June.\u00a0 These meetings were very useful as I was able to hear first-hand the issues faced by businesses in relation to insurance. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to be as pro-active as it can be on these insurance issues and will continue to liaise with the Central Bank and Insurance Ireland, as well as the Alliance for Insurance Reform on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":215,"content":"<p>Question No. 77 answered with Question No. 61.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD05200"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[13652\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of persons, earners and tax units who are self-employed and PAYE workers for each of the years 2016 to 2019 by the economic and industrial sector they were employed, income brackets (details supplied), the amount of tax paid in each earning and tax category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[13654\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000057#WRD05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the average pre-tax and after-tax incomes of tax units earning above &euro;100,000 annually; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 80 together.<\/p><p>Regarding Question 13652\/20, I am advised by Revenue that the available information on income distribution is published at link: <i><\/i>.

Full details can be found on the IUA website. <\/p><p>A total of 683 students have yet to complete the initial registration process for Calculated Grades.

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: <\/p><p>For the 2020\/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. <\/p><p>The means test arrangements of the Student Grant Scheme are applied nationally. Student grant applications are means tested on gross income from all sources earned inside and outside the State within a specified reference period. In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income, before deduction of income tax or universal social charge, is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.<\/p><p>The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).<\/p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. <\/p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of these distance learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.\u00a0 These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, the Department recently published a report to Government on Planning for reopening schools in line with the Roadmap for reopening. This report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with relevant agencies, including the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), identified the following key priorities in supporting students in re-engaging with the curriculum in the new school year:<\/p>  <p>  1. The wellbeing and socialisation of students<\/p>  <p>  2. Assessing where students are in terms of their learning<\/p>  <p>  3. Identifying the additional supports that particular learners may require<\/p>  <p>  4. Exploring options for remote provision that will compliment in-school provision and address curriculum gaps experienced during school closure<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that schools continue to be best placed to make decisions about how to support and educate all their learners during this period. My Department will continue to collaborate with the NCCA to develop guidance to schools to assist them in their planning for the next school year so as to ensure that curricular priorities are delivered and that teaching and learning is optimal in these circumstances, guided at all times by public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Students going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of their preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for the operation of the state examinations. My Department will engage with the SEC in their development of fair and robust assessment arrangements in relation to both the Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000064#WRL05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000064#WRL05700"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[13665\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000064#WRL05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to a video by parents and guardians raising issues and problems concerning the move of a school (details supplied) out of the community to Citywest; the alternative measures that can be taken in order to keep the school within the community; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":719,"content":"<p>The school to which the Deputy refers was established in 2018 and is currently in interim accommodation on the Firhouse Education Campus.\u00a0<\/p><p>Due to additional accommodation requirements in the Gaelscoil in which they are currently located my Department has been informed that it is not possible for the secondary school to continue to operate in that building.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department has informed the secondary school that interim accommodation for the school\u00a0will\u00a0be provided on the Citywest Education Campus for the 2020\/2021 academic year.<\/p><p>My Department is in on-going communication with the Patron Bodies concerned regarding all options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000064#WRL05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":720,"content":"<p>Question Nos. 254 to 257, inclusive, answered with Question No. 247.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[13670\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000064#WRL06500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress made to move the two tier pay scales for teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>The public service agreements have allowed a programme\u00a0of pay restoration for public servants to start.

Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth. <\/p>  <p>  Any amendment to the legislation governing the provision of maternity leave, which falls under my responsibility, would require primary legislation.  The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted too that, in addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday. <\/p>  <p>  Consideration is being given currently to all issues.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 May the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave. The changes are aimed at individuals who may not have been on the payroll of their employer on 29 February, or been paid in either January or February 2020 and will allow for consistent treatment with other employees.  The amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process, but in the interim Revenue has agreed to provide a facility to accommodate such cases. Although expected to be implemented on the 12th June, Revenue launched a new process on Monday 8th June which allows employers to include employees returning to employment after a period of paternity, parental or related unpaid leave or were in receipt of Health and Safety Benefit, Parent&rsquo;s Benefit or Illness Benefit paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).  Employers who wish to access the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on behalf of eligible employees covered by these changes can do so by completing a short form available for download via MyEnquiries in Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service (ROS). The relevant details that employers will need to provide to Revenue include current contractual gross pay, pay frequency, normal PRSI class, type of leave the returning employee availed of and the date of return to work. Any retrospective subsidy payments due to impacted employees will be processed by Revenue in due course. This retrospection will apply from 26 March 2020, the date of return to employment or the date the employer was registered for the scheme, whichever is the latest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000065#WRM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Regulations","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000065#WRM03000"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[13073\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000065#WRM03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will advise on an issue raised in correspondence (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>The National Vetting Bureau conducts vetting in accordance with the requirements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016.

This decision was taken in the context of the significant reorganisation of Garda resources which underpins the new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Operating Model announced by the Garda Commissioner last year.  <\/p><p>As part of the reduction of bureaucracy and streamlining of administrative processes in the new Operating Model, the number of Garda Regions and Divisions is being reduced and Sligo Garda Station will be neither a Regional nor a Divisional Headquarters.

There are a wide range of factors that need to be taken into account, including the promotion of business and trade and facilitating people who genuinely wish to come here. However, there are a number of other factors that also must be taken into consideration when any change to the visa regime is contemplated. <\/p><p>The Government is pursuing a strategy of greater co-ordination and co-operation on visa issues with the United Kingdom (UK) in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and the future expansion of the British-Irish Visa scheme. This scheme, which is agreed on a country by country basis, enables short stay visa holders to travel freely within the CTA. Since its launch for China and India there has been a substantial increase in the numbers of visitors from these countries.

Translations of public health advice have been provided to centres. During this time, centres have been asked to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser is in place for all centres and this is distributed as needed. Other PPE is also distributed as needed and in line with HPSC guidelines on its appropriate use in residential settings.<\/p><p>During this time, to ensure that we are in regular contact with our centres, a dedicated communications team within IPAS has been established. This team undertakes regular calls with all centre managers across our network of permanent and temporary centres. Feedback from these conversations is reflected in the newsletters circulated to all centre managers  and to residents to promote shared learning and best practice. The  calls also ensure that any issues or concerns can be raised without delay for appropriate resolution for the benefit of residents and staff.

The current Irish Prison Service Complaints Policy is available on the website <i>www.irishprisons.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>As set out in more detail in that policy, all prisoners have the right to make a complaint at any time and all complaints are treated with the utmost seriousness. Complaints vary in nature and seriousness - for example, some may relate to conditions of accommodation, quality of food or access to services while other complaints can be more serious such as allegations of assault, mistreatment or intimidation. The current system categorises complaints according to their nature and seriousness, ranging from the most serious 'Category A' complaint through to a 'Category F' complaint. Further information on this system, including these categories, is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service at the following link: <i>www.irishprisons.ie\/prisoner-services\/prisoner-complaints\/<\/i>.<\/p><p>The most serious &quot;Category A&quot; complaints are those alleging assault or use of excessive force against a prisoner, or ill treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation, threats or any other conduct against a prisoner of a nature and gravity likely to bring discredit on the Irish Prison Service. I understand that Category A complaints are investigated by persons outside the Prison Service. <\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of Category A complaints received in 2019 and to date in 2020 that were upheld, not upheld, not proven, terminated, incomplete or withdrawn is set out in the following table, furnished to me by the Irish Prison Service.   <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2019 <\/th>       <th>2020 (as at 25 June)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Outcome <\/td>       <td>Category A Complaints by Outcome<\/td>       <td>Category A Complaints by Outcome<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Upheld <\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Not Upheld <\/td>       <td>18 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Not Proved <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Terminated 57B   (5) (c)<\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Incomplete <\/td>       <td>26 <\/td>       <td>21 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Withdrawn <\/td>       <td>7 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Part upheld <\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Discontinued <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Re Categorised<\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total complaints made <\/td>       <td>60 <\/td>       <td>24 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the length of time if has taken to complete the investigation of Category A complaints by prisoners in 2019 and to date in 2020 is set out in the following table, furnished to me by the Irish Prison Service.

This has resulted in a number of cases outstanding. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that all such cases have been assigned to investigators and these are included in the 2020 figures.  I further understand that investigators will return to prisons next week, to resume their work. <\/p><p>In relation to Question 318, I understand from the Deputy's clarification that the information sought relates to complaints by prisoner and not prison officers. <\/p><p>In relation to the total number of complaints made in 2019 and to-date in 2020 across all complaint categories, I am informed that unfortunately it has not been possible for the Irish Prison Service to collate this information in the timeframe available.

However, the Covid-19 pandemic clearly presents unique challenges to congregated settings, including our prisons.  <\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 in a prison setting would present significant challenges, in terms of controlling the spread of the virus amongst staff and prisoners; in the provision of appropriate medical treatment to affected persons; and the maintenance of staffing levels.  To respond to this threat, a very significant number of actions were taken by the Irish Prison Service, informed and guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, the Deputy will appreciate it was necessary in the interest of the health and welfare of our prison population to suspend physical family visits in March, when public health restrictions on movement and gatherings were introduced due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  Due to these and other measures introduced by the Irish Prison Service as well as the efforts of staff, Red Cross Volunteers and prisoners themselves, there has to date been no confirmed prisoner case of Covid-19 in our prisons.  Nevertheless the Deputy will appreciate that the risk continues and must be managed.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with the Government Roadmap and with infection control in mind, the Irish Prison Servicehas completed a comprehensive risk assessment on the return of physical prison visits to each prison, within relevant physical and resource confines.  I am informed that the Irish Prison Service plans for a phased recommencement of physical family visits from Monday 20 July 2020.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy will appreciate the recommencement of visits poses a number of challenges in such an environment and must be carefully calibrated in line with ongoing risk assessments, taking account of latest public health advice, Government restrictions and the prevailing transmission rate of the virus in the community.<\/p>  <p>  To illustrate the scale of this challenge, the Irish Prison Service indicates that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, over 4,500 visitors entered our prisons on a weekly basis. In order to ensure effective infection control and allow for appropriate social distancing on resumption of physical visits, it will be necessary for capacity in both waiting areas and visiting areas to be significantly reducedto ensure family members and friends can resume visits safely.  This will impact on the ability of the Irish Prison Service to meet the anticipated level of demand for physical visits in the immediate term.<\/p>  <p>I am, of course, mindful of the ongoing impact of these necessary measures on prisoners andtheir families.  In that regard, I would note that parallel to the suspension of physical visits, the Prison Service introduced a number of new innovations including video visits, to enable prisoners to maintain contact with their families during these difficult times.  I hope that, as physical visits recommence gradually, it will be possible to continue the innovation of the video calls, which I know have been appreciated by families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000067#WRO07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":922,"content":"<p>Question No. 334 answered with Question No. 288.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":923,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 335 and 336 answered with Question No. 326.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":924,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":925,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[13691\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a full assessment has been carried out on the refurbishment costs for Sligo Garda station, including costs such as those incurred for deep retrofitting and procurement of space when refurbishment is ongoing; and the details of same.","asker":"1605","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":926,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[13692\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a comparative assessment has been done on the cost of a full refurbishment of Sligo Garda station; the cost of a new build on the site already purchased for this purpose; and the details of same.","asker":"1605","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":927,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[13694\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the rationale and time frame for reversing a decision in view of the fact that political commitments to construct a new Garda station in Sligo were in place, including the purchase of a greenfield site for same.","asker":"1605","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":928,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337 to 339, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>At the outset it is important to be clear that the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the effective and efficient use of Garda resources.  Further, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Works in relation to Garda accommodation are therefore progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW. <\/p><p>The overall purpose of the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them.  The programme is continuing to make progress at a range of locations around the country.<\/p><p>A Public Private Partnership (PPP) project was included in this programme and at the time of launch, it was intended to deliver three new Garda stations- namely a new District Headquarters at Macroom, a new District Headquarters at Clonmel and a new Regional \/ Divisional Headquarters in Sligo.  As the Deputy will recall, it was unfortunately the case that there were significant delays in relation to this intended PPP, due in the first instance to lengthy processes for acquisition of sites at all relevant locations.  <\/p><p>At the same time, very significant developments were occurring in relation to policing in Ireland.  The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was published and is now being taken forward under the 4-year implementation plan A Policing Service for our Future.<\/p><p>In keeping with that report and implementation plan, the Garda Commissioner last year announced a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This new Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on Garda&iacute; being out visibly on patrol, engaging with communities, preventing crime and supporting victims.  As part of the reduction of bureaucracy and streamlining of administrative processes, the number of Garda Regions and Divisions is being reduced and additional power will be devolved to local level so as to enable the delivery of better and more localised policing services nationwide.<\/p><p>Clearly, this new model also has implications for Garda accommodation requirements.  Following a review of its accommodation requirements , the Commissioner and his management team decided that the PPP should proceed to deliver new stations in Macroom and in Clonmel.  However, the Commissioner determined that the provision of a new station at Sligo should not proceed as part of the PPP.  <\/p><p>Sligo station is undergoing a very extensive refit and I understand that this is felt to be a more appropriate and much faster way of delivering a modern Garda Station for Sligo, in accordance with its role in the new Garda Operating Model and having regard to the fact that the current location of the station is considered optimum from the operational perspective. <\/p><p>It is however important to note that, while it was decided that delivery of a new station in Sligo under the PPP was no longer justified, the Commissioner decided that the upgrading of the existing station to a high standard will continue. <\/p><p>The Commissioner's decision was communicated to my Department by letter received on 2 January 2020. <\/p><p>I understand that significant remedial works have already taken place in the existing station, including the complete upgrade of the three floors in the building containing the public office and the provision of new locker facilities. I understand that further upgrades are progressing and include the provision of new cells and custody management facilities. <\/p><p>I am advised by the OPW that property maintenance personnel are currently on site in Sligo working on internal upgrade works at the station, to provide a new custody suite including new cells built to current standards, prisoner processing, interview, solicitor and doctor's rooms.  I understand that the existing cells were not considered suitable for upgrading and the new cells are located in a different section of the building, requiring adjacent prisoner processing facilities.  I understand that these works are currently due to be completed in December 2020.  I am further advised that the OPW is currently preparing a tender package to provide facilities for a scene of crimes unit.<\/p><p>In general I understand from the Garda authorities and the OPW that further upgrades will ensure that Garda accommodation needs in Sligo are addressed and that the station is upgraded to meet the future operational requirements of Garda members, staff and the public who use it.<\/p><p>In relation to expenditure, the following table, furnished to me by the OPW, details expenditure since 2017 and to date in 2020 on Sligo Garda Station including expenditure by the OPW drawing down on funds in both the Garda and the OPW votes. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Expenditure on Sligo Garda Station (combined total, OPW and Garda Votes as paid by OPW)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>&euro;58,362<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>&euro;116,117<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>&euro;711,093<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 (to date)<\/td>       <td>&euro;143,275<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> The Deputy will appreciate that this demonstrates the scale of the works which have been underway to ensure that Sligo Garda station is fit-for-purpose and meets the needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":929,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP01200"},{"type":"question","counter":930,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[13707\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if inquests will take place into the deaths of those that died of Covid-19 in nursing homes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":931,"content":"<p>I would like to express my deepest condolences to all of those who have lost loved ones during the current pandemic.<\/p><p>Deaths which have occurred due to COVID-19 infection are due to natural causes.

Dublin City Council (DCC) and the NTA have already published a framework of proposals to address the new and urgent needs relating to commercial activity and mobility in Dublin City Centre. As we move through the phases of the Government's Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business, improvements introduced under these plans will play an important role in providing additional transport capacity and also facilitating social distancing in urban areas. <\/p><p>The NTA has written to all 31 local authorities to offer its financial and technical support and this support will be funded through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport&rsquo;s sustainable mobility investment programme.

These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. <\/p><p>The Restart Grant gives direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30 June 2020. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, or a minimum grant of &euro;2,000, whichever is the higher, with a maximum grant of &euro;10,000. Businesses who are in arrears or have not yet paid their 2019 rates bill will still be eligible to apply for the grant. <\/p><p>Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to trade throughout the pandemic and grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. <\/p><p>My Department has intensified its digitalisation supports to retail and other businesses to better position them for the omnichannel world and increase their productivity though an expansion of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) for micro-businesses and the dedicated Online Retail Scheme for retailers with 10 or more employees.

In the first instance, it was included as a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Diseases Regulations 2020. Any infectious disease pandemic is first and foremost a matter of public health, for which a legal basis already exists in Irish law under public health legislation and specifically under Infectious Diseases Regulations. <\/p><p>In addition, notifiable infectious diseases are statutorily reportable under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 to the Medical Officer of Health for their investigation and control.<\/p><p>The reporting of COVID-19 incidents among healthcare workers is also a statutory requirement, reportable to the National Incident Management System (NIMS). <\/p><p>In relation to the reporting of COVID-19 related workplace absences to the Health and Safety Authority, there is no provision in occupational health and safety legislation for the reporting of cases of occupationally acquired COVID-19. Employers are not necessarily in a position to assess or attribute occupational disease or illness from COVID-19 with a degree of reliability since COVID-19 can be acquired in either a community or a workplace setting. Neither is there an obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer. Any requirement on employers to capture occupational diseases and illnesses would have GDPR implications and would breech an individual&rsquo;s right to the privacy of their medical information in terms of the relationship with their employer.<\/p><p>The Health and Safety Authority is fully aware of all occupational health and safety risks, including COVID-19, in healthcare settings and is engaged with the Health Service Executive, individual employers and places of work in this regard. The reporting of an accident to the Health and Safety Authority under current statutory reporting requirements does not necessarily result in an investigation. However, I would also say that any employee in any workplace who has a serious concern on an occupational health and safety matter can bring this to the attention of the Health and Safety Authority. Also, the Health and Safety Authority can also access necessary information needed to identify and investigate relevant cases in any sector and has legislative powers to request data from any employer, if and as needed. <\/p><p>As part of its role in promoting the prevention of risks to safety, health and welfare at work the Health and Safety Authority continues to provide resources, advice and support to employers and workers through its website and other means, including the operation of a confidential helpline for workers, employers and others. <\/p><p>Separately I would like to point out that it is the SARs-COV-2 (the virus that causes the disease COVID 19) that was included in the recent amendment to the Biological Agents Directive and not the disease COVID-19. The recent inclusion of SARs-COV-2 in the Biological Agents Directive provides that where the nature of the work poses an occupational exposure health risk to the virus,  such as in laboratories, healthcare settings, etc, employers are required to ensure that an appropriate Biological Agents Risk Assessment is carried out. The existing Code of Practice for Biological Agents will be updated to include SARs-COV-2 and in the interim, the Health and Safety Authority has information available on its website (<i>www.hsa.ie<\/i>)<\/p><p>I understand that the Health and Safety Authority will be reviewing the statutory requirements for the reporting of workplace injuries over the coming weeks and will forward a report on the matter to my Department for consideration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":981,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP06400"},{"type":"question","counter":982,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[13477\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000068#WRP06500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the supports available or being considered for new start-up businesses in a post-Covid-19 economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":983,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will continue to be the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone intending to start or grow a business.\u00a0 The LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland.

The Department of Health led the review of this policy, with a view to the development of a successor document which would continue the process of modernising mental health services and effectively promoting mental health.<\/p><p>The terms of reference for the refresh did not assume the need for a whole new policy document or a complete examination of policy from first principles, but rather to build on the good foundations of A Visionfor Change, particularly given that many of its principles remained valid in terms of good practice, and simply required updating and extending to reflect the best of current thinking and evolving practices in the sector.<\/p><p>Preparations for a review and update of the policy commenced with the commissioning in February 2017 of an Expert Evidence Review by the Work Research Centre (WRC) to inform the parameters of the planned refresh of mental health policy in Ireland. \u00a0The approach encompassed a stock-take of recent success in mental health and \u00a0a review of international developments, innovation, evidence and good practice. The review had a broad brief covering the various dimensions of the mental health terrain that might have relevance for informing the refresh of mental health policy in Ireland. <\/p><p>The key priorities that emerged out of the review were:<\/p><p>- The prioritisation of mentalhealth in Ireland as a major societal issue<\/p><p>- The importance of primary prevention and positive mental health<\/p><p>- A requirement to focus on social inclusion and recovery<\/p><p>- Expansion of mental health services to address the spectrum of conditions and needs<\/p><p>- Development of governance and financing to include research, evaluation and quality assurance<\/p><p>The WRC completed a supplementary paper to build on the work in the External Evidence Review, which identified specific policy changes for which a requirement may have arisen since A Vision for Change was drafted. The review identified policy themes that might require attention in the refresh such as the identification of vulnerable groups and associated actions not mentioned in the previous policy. The report also sought to consider new policy areas including a wider focus on education and prevention, and the wider use of accredited digital health interventions.

It is also possible that information relating to and promotion of the treatment is happening via word of mouth, the dark web, or other relatively difficult-to-detect methods. The HPRA is vigilant in this area and will continue to monitor for, and investigate, such matters, including co-operating and working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and other State agencies as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  The regulations in relation to medicinal products cover their placing on the market, manufacture, wholesale and retail supply and advertising. The unauthorised medicinal product known as Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) is governed by these regulations. Penalties for breaches of regulations are provided for by the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1995 and 2006. On summary conviction, a person may face fines not exceeding a class B fine (&euro;4,000) and, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year; on conviction on indictment, fines not exceeding &euro;100,000 and, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, and in the case of a second or subsequent offence on indictment, fines not exceeding &euro;250,000, and, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000070#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Properties","counter":1072,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000070#WRR01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1073,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[12768\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000070#WRR01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the land at the entrance to an estate (details supplied); if it is under the control of the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1074,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[12809\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000070#WRR01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the land (details supplied) at a location; and if it is still under the control of the HSE.","asker":"1564","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1075,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 and 396 together.<\/p><p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the management of the public healthcare property estate, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000070#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Chronic Disease Management Programme","counter":1076,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000070#WRR01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[12773\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000070#WRR01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 572 of 16 June 2020, the way in which the chronic disease management programme will be rolled out over the next three years to 2023; the categories of patients that will be added to those already commenced in the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1078,"content":"<p>In line with the terms of the 2019 GP Agreement, the Chronic Disease Management (CDM) Programme which commenced at the end of January 2020 is to be rolled out on a phased basis to adult GMS and GP visit card patients over a 4-year period, starting with those aged 75 years and over.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.<\/p>  <p>  NPHET has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19 care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in order to continue to provide access for patients there has been a considerable growth and investment in virtual outpatient consultations for many specialties across the system. The HSE advise that a total of 203,510 virtual outpatient consultations took place from March to May, representing 36% of all OPD activity over the three months.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid-19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists with a view to informing activity going forward. As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid-19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non-Covid-19 care.<\/p>  <p>  Evaluating the impact of delayed treatment forms part of two significant research programmes my Department is funding and participating in. In terms of the individual level impact, my Department is a co-investigator of an interim-wave TILDA COVID-19 survey which will seek to understand the experience of delayed healthcare due to the COVID-19 crisis. This project aims to examine the long-term impacts of the public-health led response to COVID-19 on the older population and will collate data on unmet healthcare needs. Findings will be prepared between October and end-January.<\/p>  <p>With regard to the system level impact, as part of the Department&rsquo;s Joint Research Programme in Healthcare Reform with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), work is underway to produce a publication by year-end which assesses the potential effects of COVID-19 on acute hospital expenditure projections that are currently being developed. One aspect of this report will investigate the scale of additional hospital activity required to reduce post-COVID waiting lists and maintain them at manageable levels. <\/p>  <p>  Both of the aforementioned work will be published when complete, and therefore will be publicly available. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000071#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Substance Misuse","counter":1159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000071#WRS03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1160,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[12931\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000071#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will instruct the HSE to include information on nitrous oxide under the solvent's category on drugs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1161,"content":"<p>The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in the USA considers nitrous oxide as an inhalant which covers solvents, aerosols and gases found in household products. <\/p><p>On the drugs.ie website,\u00a0nitrous oxide has its own page\u00a0 in the sedative section as technically it is categorised as sedative\/dissociative anaesthetic.

Between the 6th and the 8th of March 2020, 1,100 HCWs were tested and 4.1% were COVID-19 positive.<\/p><p>As such, it would not appear that the rates of infection among Irish healthcare workers are out of line with the experiences of comparator countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Deaths","counter":1436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1437,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[13382\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the case of the death of a person (details supplied) in a nursing home will be examined; and if a person will be contacted in relation to the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1438,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for bringing this to my attention and I would be grateful if the Deputy would pass on my deepest condolences to the family.\u00a0 I would like to reassure the Deputy that I have referred the matter to the HSE for direct reply to both him and the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":1439,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1440,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[13383\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the three hours of home help support will be provided to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1441,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","counter":1442,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1443,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[13389\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when partners and spouses will be able to resume visiting maternity hospitals before and after the delivery of their children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1444,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances","counter":1445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06800"},{"type":"question","counter":1446,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[13403\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000075#WRX06900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will release the findings of the Review of the FreeStyle Libre glucose monitoring system undertaken by his Department in 2019; and if he will consider extending the availability of the FreeStyle Libre to all persons with Type 1 diabetes","asker":"1460","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1447,"content":"<p>The review referred to by the Deputy was undertaken by the HSE.

I understand that about 90% of the commercial\u00a0bus operators have suspended their services or are\u00a0providing significantly reduced services at present.<\/p><p>On the 25th of June, Government announced changes\u00a0to the\u00a0existing public transport social distancing restrictions. It has been agreed to move from 2 metres social distancing on public transport to 50% capacity. This will help to underpin public transport during these unprecedented times for the sector, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. The Government also decided to legally require the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to age (under 13).\u00a0 These measures will protect both passengers and staff and significantly help ease the pressure on operators by\u00a0reducing the gap between public transport supply and demand.<\/p><p>Further, on\u00a0the 25th of June Government agreed new\u00a0temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, will be introduced for the licensed bus sector.\u00a0Licensed operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and revenues generated on the services. The National Transport Authority\u00a0(NTA),\u00a0as\u00a0the public transport licensing agency, will administer the support package through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Government previously introduced a &euro;12bn\u00a0package\u00a0of supports for impacted businesses of all sizes, which include: the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.\u00a0<\/p><p>Concerning vehicle testing fees - the cost of a Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT) is set by regulation 14 of the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (Vehicle Testing) (No. 2) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 347\/2013) as amended.\u00a0I do not intend to make further amendments to this legislation at present.<\/p><p>Furthermore, there are no plans currently to amend motor tax legislation to provide for waivers from motor tax (vehicle licensing). I do wish to advise that there is a facility in place to declare a vehicle off the road.\u00a0 The Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013, as amended, provides for a system of declaring vehicles off the road in advance for motor tax purposes. The declaration must be made in the last month of an existing motor tax disc or renewed in the last month of a previously made declaration of non-use.\u00a0 The declaration can be made online or in a motor tax office, using the following declaration <i><\/i><\/p><p>The declaration can be made for any number of calendar months between 3 and 12 months i.e. it cannot be made for a period of 1 or 2 months.\u00a0 If a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000081#WREE03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":1856,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[12717\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000081#WREE04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has considered automatically extending vehicle licences for coach and bus tour operators for a period of 12 months in view of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector.","asker":"1606","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":1857,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is referring to the licensing of Large Public Service Vehicles. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has over-arching responsibility regarding Public Service Vehicle licensing and testing, which is carried out by the Carriage Office for the purpose of ensuring that the vehicles are both safe and suitable for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward, under the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Licensing) Regulations, 1978.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recently advised my Department that LPSV licensing and examinations are being conducted as normal throughout this period.\u00a0 The office hours of the Carriage Office have been extended, and the office is currently open from 9.30am&ndash;4.30pm.\u00a0 The Carriage Office is operating in line with all relevant Covid-19 safety procedures, including adherence to current social distancing guidelines and, as a result, only 1 person is permitted in the office at a time to allow for this. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Given that the Carriage Office has continued to\u00a0operate effectively in the provision of all services regarding LPSV licensing, there are no plans to provide for an extension to the periods of validity of LPSV licences at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000081#WREE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1858,"content":"<p>Question No. 663 answered with Question No. 661.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":1859,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000081#WREE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1860,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[12719\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000081#WREE04400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No.1069 of 13 May 2020, if a timeline will be provided in relation to the release of the latest rail review report on the western rail corridor commissioned in 2019, in view of the fact the publication of the report is already delayed by more than six months;

While funding at local level may be provided to swimming programmes, funding will not be provided to swimming pool operators. This is a matter for the pool owners, including local authorities.\u00a0 <\/p><p>More generally, the Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. In recent months\u00a0a substantial and wide range of financial supports and guidance to help businesses impacted by the Covid 19 crisis have been put in place.

In recognition of this, a number of supports have been put in place to assist the sector in reopening.<\/p><p>I recently announced a major funding package to facilitate the reopening of ELC and SAC services from 29 June, including a<b><\/b>once-off capital grant of &euro;14.2M. All registered centre based services re-opening between 29 June and the beginning of September can avail of this grant.<\/p><p>This grant can be used by services to help them to adhere to the reopening guidelines by improving hygiene facilities and outdoor play areas. It should be noted that the definition of a capital asset is an asset intended for use on a continuing basis with an expected life of more than one year. Therefore capital grants cannot be used to purchase PPE and other consumable items.<\/p><p>There is a high level of flexibility being allowed in respect of the items that may be purchased, in recognition of the fact that services will have very different needs depending on factors such as what they already have, what age groups they cater to, and the physical layout of their premises. A list of eligible categories of items has been shared with ELC and SAC services.<\/p><p>In addition to capital, the package of supports includes a re-opening grant of &euro;18m to assist ELC and SAC services in meeting operational costs, including additional staffing costs. This may cover extra staff required to help with pick-up or drop-off times, or to provide cleaning to meet hygiene standards. ELC and SAC services will be required to verify that the reopening support payment has been used to cover additional costs. Any overheads that are additional costs associated with reopening can be assigned to this purpose.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In addition the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is continuing for employees of ELC and SAC services that reopen on 29 June, which will continue to provide support with staffing costs. There is a variety of conditions relating to the TWSS.\u00a0 Revenue update their guidance frequently and it is essential that services participating in the scheme are alert to these materials.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In developing this funding model I recognise that a reduced number of children are likely to attend ELC and SAC services in the initial weeks of reopening. This necessitates a tailored model, which will allow providers to operate with potentially less parental income. It will also ensure that ELC and SAC providers will not have to charge higher fees than they did pre-COVID-19, even though the costs of providing ELC and SAC may increase in some circumstances. This will benefit parents and children returning to services.<\/p><p>This suite of measures will run from 29 June to 23 August. Further details on all of these measures have been made available in FAQs that have been distributed to all ELC and SAC services.<\/p><p>My Department will review the operation of these measures in July and will then make further arrangements for services normally reopening in late August\/early September.

My predecessor indicated that the correspondence would need to be considered in conjunction with her then Government colleagues. In its short Seventh Interim Report, which was subsequently published on 12 June, the Commission says its final report is very close to completion but it had encountered delays as a direct result of Covid-19 restrictions. For this reason, the Commission requested an extension to complete its work in accordance with the provisions of the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004.<\/p>  <p>  At its meeting on 12 June, the then Government agreed to amend the Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference to provide for the extension sought. The final report is now due to be delivered on 30 October 2020 at the latest, and not six months as indicated by the Deputy in her question. <\/p>  <p>  In granting these extensions, the then Government considered that the public interest was best served by facilitating the Commission to produce an evidence based determination on what happened to vulnerable mothers and children in these institutions. The Commission has engaged with hundreds of former residents in its work and is attempting to comprehensively analyse information at a level beyond what has been possible to date.  In agreeing to another extension of time the priority was to safeguard this substantial work so that the independent Commission can comprehensively address these crucial questions and conclude matters as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the legislative framework.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the nature of the guarantee sought by the Deputy, it is important to clarify that a Commission of Investigation is independent in the conduct of its investigations. It must of course operate within its terms of reference and the previous Government, in granting the extensions sought, had been satisfied that the Commission was using its best endeavours to conclude its report on this painful period in our history. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that when a Commission submits its final report there are a number of procedural matters which must be addressed before the relevant Minister could seek the approval of Government to publish the report. For this reason there will always be a time interval between receipt of such reports and the separate arrangements for their publication. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that many former residents and their families will have been deeply disappointed with the Commission's need for additional time. I know that they understand that this Commission is investigating personal and sensitive matters which happened over a period of more than 75 years. So there are multiple lines of inquiry being pursued in the course of this complex statutory investigation. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to use existing channels of communication to ensure that former residents, their families and supporters are the first to be know of any developments in respect of these matters.

Details of how to sign up have been made available through the Pobal programme platform used by childcare providers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of robust oversight of Exchequer funding. This includes ensuring that funds provided under the TWSCS are used for intended purposes: to meet employee pay costs in conjunction with the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and contribute towards ongoing overhead costs.

COVID-19, made exceptional provision in the public interest and to mitigate the effect of the spread of the disease to amend and extend the Social Welfare Acts to provide for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with, or are a probable source of infection with COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of COVID-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.\u00a0 The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with COVID-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of COVID-19, that the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.\u00a0 This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health

comment on the detail of the proposals.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently no provision for paying a top-up pension.\u00a0 The introduction of a such a payment and any related changes to the PRSI system would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary contexts.\u00a0 Any future policy decisions\u00a0related to\u00a0the state pension system will obviously reflect the policy priorities of\u00a0the incoming Government. <\/p>  <p>  The Total Contributions Approach (TCA), when it is introduced, is intended to be a fairer and more transparent system where the person&rsquo;s lifetime contribution will be more closely reflected in the benefit received.\u00a0 Having carefully examined the outputs of the TCA consultation process, officials in the Department are designing the scheme, with a view to including significant recognition for home caring periods in the new model.\u00a0 The final design of the model will need to be brought to Government for its consideration and approval.<\/p>  <p>  The State Pension (Contributory) is a PRSI-based pension, financed by contributions made by current workers and their employers, and paid to pensioners, at a rate based upon their PRSI record when working.\u00a0 Those with few or no PRSI contributions paid over the years may alternatively qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), which is a means-tested pension, financed by the Exchequer, and paid at up to 95% the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).\u00a0 There are also\u00a0significant disregards in the household means test for the State Pension (Non-Contributory).\u00a0 Alternatively, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a Qualified Adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate State Pension (Contributory).\u00a0 The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it should be noted that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland and the age at which employees retire is determined by the employment contract between the employer and the employee.\u00a0 Many such contracts may have been entered into in the context of previous state pension arrangements.\u00a0 However, a mandatory retirement age did not apply.\u00a0 Employers are legally entitled to increase the duration of the employee's employment for either one or two years, depending on when he or she plans to retire, if both parties agree.\u00a0\u00a0The Workplace Relations Commission has produced a code of practice on longer working, and The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also published guidance material for employees and employers who use fixed-term contracts beyond what was the normal retirement age of 65 years.\u00a0 Statistical data on long-term demographic changes indicate that\u00a0people are living longer and healthier lives.\u00a0 Many of them may want to continue working after 65 and these resources can facilitate them in their choice.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the

However, with prior written permission from the Department, a person may undertake light work for which no remuneration is or would ordinarily be payable.\u00a0\u00a0Should a person in receipt of IP wish to take up or resume open labour market employment, they may qualify for Partial Capacity Benefit, a social welfare scheme which allows a person to return to work or self-employment (if they have reduced capacity to work) and continue to receive a payment from the Department.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000087#WRLL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":2271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000087#WRLL02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2272,"qnumday":808,"qnumall":"[12884\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000087#WRLL02500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons on the pandemic unemployment payment due to have it reduced to &euro;203 as a result of having previously earned less than &euro;200 in wages, in receipt of child benefit.","asker":"1628","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":2273,"qnumday":811,"qnumall":"[12887\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000087#WRLL02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons on the pandemic unemployment payment due to have it reduced to &euro;203 and in receipt of child benefit, that were not previously in receipt of another social welfare payment (details supplied).","asker":"1628","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2274,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 808 and 811 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that at this juncture it is not yet possible to report on the number of persons due to have their pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) adjusted from 7 July 2020.

The Building Regulations, including Part K requirements, are subject to ongoing review. <\/p><p>Safety restrictors should restrain the window sufficiently to prevent such falls. Restrictors can be either an integral part of the window operating gear or separate items of hardware which can be fitted to a window at the time of manufacture or at installation. Restrictors should operate so that they limit the initial movement of an opening section to not more than 100 mm. <\/p><p>In relation to products, Part D of the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements for materials and workmanship.

policy.\u00a0 Similarly, the Programme for Government commits to the development of the cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway as viable alternatives to Dublin using Project Ireland 2040, to help regional towns prosper.\u00a0 The Programme for Government notes the importance of balanced regional development in reducing environmental pressures and keeping our smaller urban centres vibrant.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities have already been provided with a number of powers and measures to deal with the issue of vacancy and dereliction of in our urban centres. There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  From a legislative perspective, this includes for example,\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - the Derelict Sites Act 1990, which imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site;<\/p>  <p>  - the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2018, which came into operation on 8 February 2018, and provides for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of the change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground floor premises, to residential use. This measure is aimed at facilitating the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply;<\/p>  <p>  - the vacant site levy provisions in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, under which planning authorities were empowered to apply a vacant site levy of 3% of the market valuation of relevant properties which were listed on local authority vacant site registers in 2018, which relevant owners were liable to pay in January 2019. The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January 2020; and<\/p>  <p>  - local authorities also have compulsory purchase order powers which can be used in certain circumstances to address these issues.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  From a funding perspective, significant resourcing is being provided to enhance the urban environment of our cities, towns and villages through the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund established under Project Ireland 2040: The National Development Plan.\u00a0 The URDF, which is the fund operated by my Department, was launched in 2018 and has an overall provision of &euro;2 billion to 2027.\u00a0 \u00a0The URDF was established to support applicant-led projects that will contribute to regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the NPF and the NDP. The aim is to achieve more compact,\u00a0 sustainable and mixed use development, with a view to ensuring that more\u00a0parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit. This will be done by supporting proposals that contribute to the re-development of key brownfield areas, including areas containing derelict sites and buildings, both by enabling infrastructure and new master-planned development proposals. \u00a088 projects across the breadth of the country have been approved for URDF support thus far.\u00a0 A second call for proposals was launched in January of this year.\u00a0 The closing date for applications was 29 May 2020 and these applications are now being assessed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Vacant Home Reuse Strategy 2018-21, the Vacant Homes Unit in my Department has, since 2018, provided annual funding of &euro;50,000 to each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. Each such office is tasked to support, implement and further develop, update, monitor and review the progress of local authorities&rsquo; Vacant Homes Action Plans and actions to address vacant private housing; in addition to other core functions to identify and bring back vacant homes into use.\u00a0 In addition, under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, two schemes were introduced to assist in bringing vacant stock back into use.<\/p>  <p>  - the Repair and Leasing Scheme introduced to assist property owners in bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes. The\u00a0scheme is particularly targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties.<\/p>  <p>  - the Buy and Renew Scheme introduced to support local authorities in purchasing and renewing housing units in need of repair which can then be made available for social housing use.\u00a0 The Buy and Renew Scheme particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.\u00a0 As a complementary initiative to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, it provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners of vacant properties. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The regeneration of our towns and villages will remain an important component of urban policy and the Programme for Government in committing to the continuation of the URDF and RRDF, also proposes the bringing forward of an expanded town and village renewal scheme to bring vacant and derelict building back into use and promote residential occupancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":2462,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2463,"qnumday":880,"qnumall":"[13037\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a house must be in a catchment area identified as a prioritised area for action in accordance with the River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021 in order to qualify for the new domestic wastewater treatment grants as recently announced; if a house with a treatment system that needs an urgent upgrade can apply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":2464,"content":"<p>Under the Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012 (Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems) Regulations 2012, the owner of a domestic waste water treatment system is responsible for its maintenance and renewal\u00a0 and shall ensure that its parts and components are fit for purpose, operational where appropriate and kept in good order and repair so as to prevent a risk to human health or environment.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Housing (Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems Financial Assistance) Regulations (S.I. 184 of 2020), revises the grant scheme to support the remediation, repair or upgrading works to, or the replacement of a domestic waste water treatment system under the National Inspection Plan.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following an examination of the previous arrangements, consultation with stakeholders including local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health Service Executive, and consideration of the matter by the Rural Water Working Group, the revised scheme brings into effect the following changes:<\/p>  <p>  - The means test that previously applied to this grant scheme has been removed. <\/p>  <p>  - The level of grant support has been increased to 85% of the eligible costs of approved works subject to a maximum grant of &euro;5,000.\u00a0 The maximum grant available previously was &euro;2,500 or &euro;4,000 depending on the financial means of the applicant.

The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended.\u00a0 HAP supported tenancies are afforded the same protections as all private rented tenancies. \u00a0The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned.\u00a0 Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.\u00a0 It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord beyond that of their HAP payment. However, decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation, is solely a matter for the local authority concerned and local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.<\/p><p>Where HAP tenants are not financially impacted by the COVID-19 measures, they are expected to continue to pay their HAP differential rent.\u00a0 However, if tenants&rsquo; circumstances change, the local authority should reassess those tenants and adjust their differential rent accordingly. Local authorities have been requested to ensure that HAP tenants newly in receipt of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) supports be facilitated in remaining in their HAP tenancies. If amendments cannot be made immediately to a tenant&rsquo;s differential rent amount, any arrears accumulating from the date of approval of the new DEASP support should be rectified at a later date.This will not affect the HAP payment to the landlord.<\/p><p>The DEASP Rent Supplement scheme continues to play a key role in supporting families and individuals in private rented accommodation, with the scheme currently supporting approximately 21,200 recipients. The scheme provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme ensures that renters experiencing a temporary loss of employment during the COVID-19 emergency can continue to meet their rental commitments.<\/p><p>Since the introduction of the former Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 emergency response approximately, 6,700 customers have been provided Rent Supplement support; in addition,\u00a0there are currently, approximately, 1,100 pending applications awaiting a decision or in the process of providing the necessary documentation to the officer dealing with their claim. The DEASP response to the COVID-19 emergency has ensured the flexibility of the Rent Supplement scheme via specific measures to prevent undue delays in processing applications despite the large number of new cases received over a relatively short timeframe. The 2\/3 day turnaround of applications ensures that customers\u00a0do not build up rent arrears and officers attempt to ensure that a person's rental obligations are met in full.<\/p><p>The DEASP Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by providing assistance to those whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.\u00a0 The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.\u00a0 There are several payments within the scheme including once-off exceptional needs payments (ENPs) which can cover rent arrears.<\/p><p>Where a person has a change of circumstances, such as a loss of income, they should notify the relevant local authority in the case of a HAP claim, or the DEASP for Rent Supplement to assess the level of any payment that can be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Appeals","counter":2480,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO03700"},{"type":"question","counter":2481,"qnumday":886,"qnumall":"[13261\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that have been the subject of judicial review proceedings in the past ten years; the number of decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la quashed by the courts; the number of High Court cases appealed to a higher court; the success rate on appeal for An Bord Plean&aacute;la; the number of times An Bord Plean&aacute;la conceded to the plaintiff in a judicial review case; the number of times legislation has been amended as a result of decisions of the courts; the legal firm and barristers that represented An Bord Plean&aacute;la in each case; the legal costs for each member of the legal team by case in the past ten years; the legal costs of the plaintiffs in circumstances in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la lost or did not concede by case; and the details of legal costs including persons paid and payments to the legal team of the plaintiff in cases in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la conceded without trial.","asker":"1622","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":2482,"content":"<p>The recording of court cases is one in which I have no statutory function and is a matter for the Courts Service which is statutorily independent.

The nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby.<\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0has progressively updated Part L of the Building Regulations, relating to the Conservation of Fuel and Energy in Dwellings, over the last decade in order to improve the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to achieve these &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo; performance levels &ndash; which are equivalent to an A2 Building Energy Rating (BER) for a typical dwelling. <\/p>  <p>  The performance requirements in building regulations are set at the cost optimal level which ensure that the best energy performance is obtained for the lowest lifecycle cost taking account of capital cost and operating costs. The cost optimal calculations are reviewed every 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  A range of solutions can be used to achieve these performance requirements. The advanced performance requirements in the current regulations combined with a mandatory renewables requirement, is creating a rapid transition to low carbon heating systems in all new dwellings.\u00a0 New social housing is subject to these same requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Builders and homeowners have a choice in deciding which energy system best suits their needs. The\u00a0regulations encourage the use of renewable technologies and the move away from traditional fossil fuels.\u00a0 This strategy is working based on CSO statistics&ndash; the installation of oil boilers has dropped from 36% to 4% in new dwellings.\u00a0 Electrical heating systems which are primarily heat pumps has increased to 44% in new dwellings in recent years and continue to increase their market share every quarter. There are no statistics available on the percentage of new social housing specifically that have a heat pump however it is expected that it would follow the national trend for all new dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cumulative improvements to regulations mean that a dwelling built to the 2011 Part L regulations requires 90% less energy than the equivalent dwelling built in 1978 to deliver the same standards of heat, hot water and light.\u00a0 This shows the very significant progress that has already been made in the standards for new buildings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Data","counter":2492,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO05000"},{"type":"question","counter":2493,"qnumday":892,"qnumall":"[13394\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020063000090#WROO05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of persons sleeping rough in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":2494,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.\u00a0 Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and associated services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  In the Dublin region, an official rough sleeper count is conducted twice yearly, in April and November, by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE). \u00a0The latest official Dublin Region rough sleeper count took place on the night of 26 November 2019.\u00a0 A total of 90 individuals were identified sleeping rough.\u00a0 This was the lowest figure for a winter rough sleeper count since 2015. \u00a0\u00a0The count scheduled for April 2020 was deferred due to Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  The DRHE has put in place an assertive outreach service to engage with individuals who are rough sleeping, to encourage them to avail of accommodation and related supports.\u00a0 This work is continuing as normal during the COVID-19 response in accordance with public health guidelines.
