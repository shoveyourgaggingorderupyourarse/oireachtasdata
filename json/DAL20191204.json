My colleague, Deputy Brady, has consistently asked the Minister when the report, committed to in Pathways to Work, will be printed.

She needs to commit to a time and date in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2016, the then Minister, the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said a report would be published later in the year.  In May 2017, it was said it would be published that year.  In February, April, September and October of this year, the Minister told my colleagues it would be completed shortly.  Last year, she told the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection that the report was practically ready.  Where is it?  When will it be published?  I understand it is now ready so I would like a publication date.<\/p>  <p>  In budget 2020, the Minister deliberately introduced a new condition for those between 18 and 24, allowing the full rate to be payable only when they are living independently and in receipt of State support.

The Department was keen to have the university research used to inform its own report.  It would not make sense for the Department to prepare a report in addition to the detailed, independent research.  My Department received a copy of the final report from the university late last year.  The officials met the research team in February this year to discuss the results of the research and learn from the findings.  The detailed analysis of the findings was examined and used to inform my Department's own review.  As I said, I have just received the report in the last day or so.

He has committed that all of the funds raised by increases in the carbon tax will be ring-fenced to protect those most exposed to higher fuel and energy costs, to support a just transition for displaced workers and to invest in new climate action measures.  On 9 October 2019, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the document, The Carbon Tax Increase - What it will be spent on, which sets out specific details on the allocation of these ring-fenced moneys for next year.<\/p>  <p>  The fuel allowance scheme is a targeted measure to protect those who are most vulnerable from energy poverty.  For this reason, the largest single allocation, of almost one quarter of the funds that will be raised next year owing to the increased carbon tax, will be devoted to ensuring that the least well-off in society are protected through increases in the fuel allowance payment and also through energy efficiency upgrades targeted at those in energy poverty.  It is estimated that over 370,000 recipients will benefit from the increases and new activities in 2020.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the household benefits scheme, at an estimated cost of &euro;188 million in 2019.  In budget 2020, I extended the household benefits package to people under 70 who have another adult living with them.  I also announced a &euro;5 increase in the living alone allowance, which I hope will benefit approximately 216,000 recipients in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances with special heating needs.  An exceptional needs payment may also be made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This payment can be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost that customers are unable to meet out of their own resources.  This may, and sometimes does, include exceptional heating costs.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, has the role of reducing energy poverty by implementing measures, administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to improve the energy efficiency of homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400004#B01900","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1575456600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The Minister will be aware that studies have shown that fuel poverty is rampant in this country.

The report indicated that the additional cost of the carbon tax would be less than the weekly net value of the fuel allowance increases for those households living in the four lowest percentiles.  The reason for the increase we chose was to protect the very people who are on the fuel allowance.  The ESRI report stated that households in the lowest four percentiles will have an expected increase in fuel costs of &euro;45 per annum in 2020.  The increase in the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week amounts to approximately &euro;56, which means there is some headroom should anything happen in the coming year.  However, that is not the totality of what the Government is doing.

As far back as 2007,\u00a0the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Martin Cullen, launched the Green Paper on Pensions, which proposed raising the pension age.  That was followed by a major public consultation exercise.  Three years later, following the public consultation, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mary Hanafin, launched the national pensions framework.  Following a Government decision, it set out the\u00a0agenda of changes in the State pension age to be enacted in 2014, 2021 and 2028.  This strategy was enacted\u00a0via legislation introduced by the then\u00a0Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton,\u00a0and passed in 2011.  It provided for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023, which I launched last year, stated that future changes in the State pension age after 2035 will be\u00a0based on research into life expectancy.  We are all well aware that, thankfully, we are living longer and happier lives.  That is in keeping with similar measures introduced by most EU and OECD countries.<\/p>  <p>  The reason for the changes was to make the State pension system more sustainable as life expectancy increases.  That is essential, as people who are working now and whose PRSI contributions fund State pension payments will need a State pension when the time comes for them to retire.  The demographic change has significant implications for the future costs of the State's pension provision, which are increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every four to five years.  This figure does not take account of any rate increases we may want for pensioners.  The number of recipients of contributory and non-contributory State pensions is estimated to increase by an average of 21,300 per year up to 2024.  It is also estimated that\u00a088% will have entered insurable employment at least\u00a020 years before reaching the State pension age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400005#C00800","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1575456600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I must contradict what the Minister said about the European trend and the average age of retirement.

These include key decisions on the target membership, the contribution rates, the policies on opting-out and re-enrolment, the administrative arrangements and organisational approach, and the investment options.<\/p>  <p>  As stated in A Roadmap for Pensions Reform, the Government proposes to begin implementation of this system, which we know affectionately as automatic enrolment, by 2022.  This will see a transition from the current purely voluntary system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality-assured retirement savings system.  The saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt in or opt out.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has decided that a new central processing authority will be established by the State to administer the automatic enrolment system.  Proposals are being finalised by my officials on the appropriate scope and role of this central processing authority, which I hope to bring to Cabinet very early in January.  The proposal will include an assessment as to the extent to which existing public infrastructure could be used to carry out some or all of the functions that will be needed to operate the automatic enrolment system.<\/p>  <p>  While an approach allowing for an early drawdown for a mortgage deposit, for example, may appear reasonable and improve the attractiveness of saving for some people, the core policy objective of introducing automatic enrolment, including the employer and Government subsidies, is to ensure people have adequate savings when they reach 66, 67 or thereafter.  Allowing people to access their pension savings early for non-pension purposes would inevitably reduce the value of the future fund available to them, and given that the combined value of employer and Government contributions to the pensions savings scheme will exceed those of the workers, it could distort the housing market.  That is the view of some of our advisers.  However, the Government has decided that a limited number of savings suspension periods will be facilitated for members who wish to cease making their contributions temporarily for exactly the reason the Deputy described, namely, that they may be saving for their house.  These savings suspension periods could be used for people with children going to college or for whatever reason, but they are limited in their scope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400006#D00700","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1575457200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response and I welcome that improvement on the original proposal.

As the Deputy suggested, if somebody with a current pension finds this pension scheme more attractive to him or her, there is nothing stopping them taking their current pension and moving it into the automatic enrolment system.

The real value is that some people arrive to the CE scheme when they are somewhat removed from being active in the labour market or even the social economy in their own communities.  They need genuine extra over-and-above support care and attention, monitoring, mentoring and coaching.  They get that in spades from our CE supervisors.  This is why I made it a priority.  I made a commitment to the CE supervisors and the unions to try to address the issues that were arising and still outstanding from the Labour Court recommendations of 2008.<\/p> <p>We started our consideration process at the beginning of the summer.  It is ongoing.  We agreed some parameters.  They know what my outcomes look like, I know what their wants look like.  The commitment I have given them is that I will not stop until we achieve those.  Given that some of the recommendations have very large and tangible consequences, probably unintended from their perspective, it is not as easy a route as some people might think, hence the issue has been floating around since 2008.

This is a decision of the WRC and I urge her to implement that decision.  A pension scheme was to have been put in place for CE supervisors in 2008.

We have reallocated some significant resources, particularly this year in the Department to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Since I became Minister, the Department's social welfare inspectors have been instructed to redouble their efforts with a nationwide campaign of employer inspections.  That happens through our scope section which is long established and spread all around the country where we have our inspectors.  As the Deputy is aware they do other inspections apart from bogus self-employment and because of that I decided earlier this year to establish a dedicated new unit of inspectors with a specific focus on tackling false self-employment.  I have increased the number of deciding officers in that scope section.<\/p> <p>Although they are new and separate, they still operate under the umbrella of the scope section.  I have increased the number of deciding officers in anticipation of an increase in referrals to the scope section as a result of the increased and targeted inspections.  I have also instructed my officials to develop legislation in the form of a new criminal offence to prohibit and penalise the willful misclassification of a person as being self-employed when he or she is an employee; new anti-victimisation measures, with recourse to the WRC for fearful workers who wish to seek a determination on their employment status from the scope section but have told me privately that they are afraid to do so, which cannot be countenanced; and a new guidance document on employment status that is to be put on a statutory footing so that everybody will be clear about their obligations and rights with regard to employment.<br\/><br\/>The employment status investigation unit, ESIU, comprises the new team of social welfare inspectors.  I have specifically tasked the unit with detecting, targeting and reducing false self-employment.  The ESIU has a current caseload that potentially affects over 500 workers across a range of sectors, including the tourism, fitness, dental, and retail sectors.  Two employer cases have been decided since the introduction of the changes I have just outlined.  It is not just two because we are now entering organisations and assessing an entire body of employees.  One person as confirmed as being properly self-employed but the case covered a potential 156 workers.  We have determined that all of these 156 workers are classified correctly and no further action is needed.  The other case covered 19 workers found initially to have been inaccurately categorised as being self-employed.  An appeal has been lodged in that case.  If we win the appeal, we will assess arrears and seek compliance in that case.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>The ESIU has initiated a programme of solo inspections in the construction industry and English language training sectors.  It is also planning to carry out joint inspection projects with the joint investigation unit, that is, the special investigation unit, Revenue and the WRC, focused on the construction industry early in the new year.<br\/><br\/>The ESIU is also working with our business analytics unit using predictive analytics to assist with the targeting of companies where false self-employment is likely to occur.  This work is in its initial phase and it is intended to develop it over time.<br\/><br\/>More generally, the scope section receives requests for decisions on employment status from a variety of sources.  These include requests from employers, employees, social welfare Inspectors, social welfare scheme areas and Revenue.  Two such requests have been received so far this year from Revenue.<br\/><br\/>Regarding inspections and reviews, there are approximately 350 social welfare inspectors appointed nationwide who carry out work across PRSI and social welfare schemes, including the special investigation unit and the ESIU.I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400008#F01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575459000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I was trying to make notes as the Minister was giving her reply.

All I can do, when I report the numbers, is report the average time.<\/p>  <p>  It bothers me to learn from Deputy Collins that average waiting times appear to be increasing because the statistics indicate that the additional resources we have put into the carer's section are yielding results.  Not long ago, I was in this Chamber apologising because at one point carer's allowance applicants were waiting 17 weeks on average.  That meant the best outcome for an applicant was to wait for 17 weeks.  God love those who could have been waiting much longer.  The average waiting time for processing disability allowance applications is ten weeks.  For carer's allowance, the average is ten weeks.  For domiciliary care allowance, it is between ten and 12 weeks.  The reason for the decrease is that, arising from efficiencies in other sections, we added extra staff with expertise to the division.<\/p>  <p>  That is the plan.  Without being smart, we knew that the carer's application form was a bit cumbersome.  We spent a year working with Family Carers Ireland to do exactly what we did with the domiciliary care allowance application a number of years ago working with DCA Warriors.  People tend to engage better and provide more information when the application process is made more streamlined.  While this process and the additional staff we have provided significantly improved turnaround times, we still experience cases of applicants holding back information they think they will need for an appeal.  The result is that the ten or 12 week process starts all over again because the application must go to the bottom of the new deciding officer's list.  That is frustrating for me.  Instead of having an applications that have been rejected because they are not complete going to appeal and the process starting all over again, I have considered having a review process somewhere in the middle.  However, that would create another pile.  Without wishing to sound snarky, everybody should give us all of the information they can in the first instance.

Our roadmap for social inclusion is far more than just another report.  The use of that term says a lot about the Deputy's opinion.  I intend to bring the social inclusion strategy to Cabinet for review at the earliest opportunity.  I received a draft of our new social inclusion strategy only last week.  It will have a whole-of-Government approach which recognises the shared responsibility across Government to achieve improved outcomes for the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society who I am happy to represent and do my best to look after.  The roadmap will state a clear ambition to achieve the long-held, but as yet unrealised, target of reducing consistent poverty to 2% or less.  It also aspires to make Ireland one of the\u00a0most socially inclusive states in the EU.  It sets a number of specific targets to be achieved across various sectors of government and identifies commitments to be delivered by each Department with timelines for delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The roadmap will reflect the most recent poverty data from the 2018 survey on income and living conditions, SILC, published by the CSO last week.<\/p> <p>That data shows that the consistent poverty rate decreased to 5.6% in 2018, down from 6.7% in 2017.  The percentage of the population experiencing deprivation also decreased significantly, falling to 15.1% from 18.8% in 2017.

Perhaps she has a different definition of what \"shortly\" means.

We have a major crisis with poverty in this State, whether it is child or in work poverty, and it is not being tackled.  More than 100,000 people at work in the State live in poverty.  Work should be a route out of poverty for people in Ireland but it is not.

The reality is that Dara Murphy should have resigned at the end of 2017 because since he took up office with the Fine Gael grouping in Europe, the European People's Party, EPP, his parliamentary input has been reduced to near zero, to quote Harry McGee of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  Since then, he effectively became an absentee Teachta D&aacute;la while still drawing a full salary.<\/p><p>Our role as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la is essentially twofold; it is representational and legislative.  We represent individuals, residents, communities, cities and counties on a range of issues and seek to resolve grievances and concerns through Parliament.  We also make laws and engage in public debate which helps to influence and shape such laws.<\/p><p>Since the end of 2017, Dara Murphy did not discharge either of these functions.  He has not spoken in the D&aacute;il since 7 December 2017.  I understand he only attended the Committee on Public Petitions once during 2018 and 2019.  He asked a total of five parliamentary questions in 2019 and only two in 2018.  I invite people to compare that record to that of his three colleagues in Cork North-Central.  That behaviour reflects total disengagement from the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The people of the northside of Cork elected him to represent them.  For the past two years he did not do that.  The people of the northside of Cork were neglected by him, and that was endorsed by the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael Party.  The Taoiseach defended this behaviour, saying late last week that, &quot;His main job has been a European job in the past two years, and he's done that extremely well&quot;.  His job was with the Fine Gael Party in Europe.  It had nothing to do with the D&aacute;il or the European Parliament.  Does the Taoiseach understand that basic point?  Does he accept that former Deputy Dara Murphy's behaviour has fundamentally breached the code of conduct for Members in that he betrayed the trust placed in him by the people of the northside of Cork and has failed to obtain public confidence and trust in his role as a Teachta D&aacute;la and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as an institution?<\/p><p>People are angry about this.  People everywhere are talking about it.  The Taoiseach sanctioned and okayed this and put party interest before the public interest.  Working with Fine Gael and the EPP had nothing to do with D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Dara Murphy's responsibility as a Deputy.  Does the Taoiseach accept that he and the Fine Gael Party were wrong to sanction this arrangement and that he should apologise to the people of the northside of Cork, in particular, for the neglect of the past two years?  Does he accept the basic point that former Deputy Dara Murphy's behaviour over the past two years was not morally sustainable?  Can he outline the nature of his discussion with Dara Murphy in May 2018 when he announced that he would not contest the next general election?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400012#K01100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1575460800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin.  As he will be aware, Dara Murphy has resigned from the D&aacute;il and is no longer a Member of the House or the Fine Gael parliamentary party.  He is taking up a new role in the European Commission, a job he applied for and got.  It is not a Government appointment.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to his remuneration and expenses, I spoke to him last night and last weekend.  Last night he confirmed that he is willing to submit to any formal investigation regarding his conduct, whether it is his remuneration, expenses or whatever, and that can be done by the ethics committee or the Standards in Public Office Commission.  If it cannot be done by those bodies for some reason, he is willing to put all of the information in front of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il who can examine whether or not he complied with the rules and regulations of this House.<\/p>  <p>  His role with the EPP was as a campaign director for a period of time and ended six months ago.  While he did that role he was still responsible for looking after his constituency, through his constituency office in Cork, and being here as a TD and Member of the D&aacute;il.  The record shows that he was here for 120 days last year, including for 40-something sitting days, and voted on occasions.  He is not the only Member of the House to have another job and other employment.

This is not about a person having two jobs.  People are angry that he took a full salary.  The Taoiseach avoided the substance of my position, which is that he effectively walked away from the D&aacute;il at the end of 2017.  He did not represent the people of Cork from the end of 2017 onwards.  The record speaks for itself.  I am not talking about mere physical attendance.  I am talking about parliamentary representation and representing people on the ground, which was non-existent, and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, which was non-existent.<\/p> <p>It goes to the very core of the work of a Teachta D&aacute;la to represent the people who elected him.  The Taoiseach issued a fulsome statement in May 2018, when Dara Murphy announced he was not contesting the next general election.  He confirmed that Dara Murphy would be continuing as director of elections for the European People's Party, EPP, which is Fine Gael's grouping in the European Parliament.  The Taoiseach went on to state that &ldquo;So while Dara might be leaving the D&aacute;il, he is certainly not leaving political life or Fine Gael\", and then added that, &ldquo;I look forward to working with him closely during the next phase of his career.&rdquo;  Dara Murphy essentially left the D&aacute;il, however.  He left the people of Cork behind him and said goodbye, and that was okay with the Taoiseach.  What was more important was that Dara Murphy was not leaving Fine Gael and he was working with the party in Europe full-time.  That seemed to be fine.  <\/p> <p> The reason I asked the question was that situation dovetailed with Dara Murphy's announcement that he was not seeking re-election.  As far as the Taoiseach was concerned, the people of Cork did not matter and whether Dara Murphy continued working as a Deputy did not matter.  All that mattered was that he was going to be with Fine Gael in Europe.  Will the Taoiseach accept he was guilty of a serious error of judgment in allowing such a practice and behaviour, which has angered people and eroded public confidence in our democratic institutions?

Threshold states this is not an isolated case and recounts another incident of a pregnant woman living in private rented accommodation where a new baby was not wanted by the landlord.  That woman ended up moving into homeless accommodation with her new-born.<\/p><p>Does this not illustrate the depths of the crisis facing renters under the housing policy of the Taoiseach's Government?  The 10,500 people who are now homeless deserve better than what they got on the floor of the D&aacute;il last night.  That was an opportunity to start from scratch, take stock, and do the right and the wise thing of accepting the system is broken and changing course.  The Taoiseach and the Government could have listened to the solutions, such as a radical plan of home building, both council and affordable, a reduction in rents through a rent freeze and tax relief, and the implementation of Deputy Pearse Doherty's No Consent, No Sale Bill to protect family homes from circling vulture funds and evictions.  The Government did not do that, however.  It wasted that opportunity and backed its man to the hilt, as did the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who have now clearly shown whose side they are on.  They have not shown up to take the side of homeless children and struggling workers and families, but the side of landlords and property speculators.  To add insult to injury, the Government bartered, cajoled and arm-twisted three Independent Deputies by promising requests and favours to be met in return for supporting the Government's man.  The Government even bussed in the absentee Deputy for Cork North-Central - for one night only, however, as we hear this morning that he has resigned his seat merely hours after casting his vote of confidence.  It was a farewell tour before he starts his solo career, though he has certainly been serving himself quite well for some time now - disgraceful behaviour that has let down the people of the northside of Cork city.<\/p><p>Where has all this got the Taoiseach, this desperate attempt to defend and protect his Minister?  Some 10,514 people are homeless, including 4,000 children, there are record numbers all the time, including in Cork, children will wait for Santa in bed and breakfast and emergency accommodation, average rents in some places have now reached in excess of &euro;2,000, people are years waiting on council housing waiting lists - last week, I met people 13 years and 17 years on the housing waiting lists - and a whole generation has no prospect of owning their own homes.  In light of the figures released last night and the swathe of evidence in front of us, will the Taoiseach accept that his housing policies are not working and will he finally change direction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400013#L03800","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1575461400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  I am very sorry to hear about that case he illustrated in his contribution.  I do not want to comment on the detail without knowing all of the facts and information.  It would be inappropriate to do so.  What I do know is that pregnancy or having a child is not grounds for eviction - that would be illegal - and is certainly not grounds for issuing a notice to quit.  That is why we have bodies such as Threshold and others that can assist people if they find themselves dealing with a landlord of that nature.  We also have the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, a public body set up by the Government, to help enforce the rights of tenants.  As a Government we have enhanced tenants' rights and we have given more resources to the Residential Tenancies Board to deal with matters such as that.  While most landlords may well be very good people who provide much needed rental accommodation, there are bad landlords and we have laws to deal with them and we have an enforcement mechanism through the RTB to deal with them as well.  I do not know how the case described by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire ended, but that is how it should have been dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  We disagree on some things, but there are some things we agree on, and one of those is that the core of the solution to the housing shortage is more supply.  That is exactly what we are doing: building more homes, council houses and social housing for people on the housing list, more private housing, because most people want to buy their own home, and more homes for people to rent.  More supply is what is required.<\/p>  <p>  Where have we come from and where are we now?  Before the Government launched its housing plan, Rebuilding Ireland, three and a half years ago, housing supply was on the floor.  Only about 7,000 houses were built in the year before Rebuilding Ireland was launched.  We are now up to 20,000 houses being built this year and probably 25,000 houses next year.  When it comes to social housing, in the Deputy's own city of Cork, the council only built about one social house before Rebuilding Ireland was launched, but about 1,000 houses are now under construction or in process.  This year, we will build and provide more social housing than in any year this century, through the boom and the bust.  We are delivering on housing supply - homes for people to buy, because that is what most people want, but also social housing because that is what some people need.<\/p>  <p>  It was never going to be possible to go from a situation where virtually no houses were being built to suddenly having 35,000 or 40,000 houses being built every year, which is where we need to go to.  No Government and no party, no matter the resources or the will, can just turn housing construction on and off like a tap.  We had a collapse in this country's economy ten years ago.  The Government was bust and did not build any housing for a very long time.  The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government would have built more housing if we could have afforded to, but we could not.  The banks were bust and not in a position to lend to builders, while the construction industry was on the floor as well.  It went bust and nearly 100,000 people emigrated as a result, many of them construction workers.  It was never going to be the case that we could just turn back on the tap.<\/p> <p>When one compares where we were three years ago to where we are now on supply, it has been a dramatic turnaround.  We need to build on that to make sure we continue to increase the supply of housing.  That is how we will get on top of this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400013#L03900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575462000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>The landlord was fined and rightly so.

We are thinking of the 159 women who had missed opportunities to get interventions.  Following the publication of the report, the 221+ group will help and support those women over the coming weeks.  We know that cancer screening is not diagnostic and is not perfect.  We also know that the promotion of screening is critically important.  This House knows that screening saves lives.  Collectively, all of us are making progress on HPV screening and HPV vaccinations, on which my party has led.  We are changing the quality assurance and management of our screening programmes.  All of this good work represents good progress.<\/p>  <p>  We know there have been a large volume of mistakes and errors in the administration of the screening programme when it comes to the HSE and the Department of Health.  This has been demonstrated in the two Scally reports and the MacCraith report and has been compounded by incredibly inept communications and failures with regard to mandatory disclosure.  Yesterday, the chief patient advocate who was on the RCOG review and the cervical cancer steering group, Lorraine Walsh, told us that she resigned from both roles on 31 October last.  I know Lorraine Walsh very well.  She is one of the most formidable people I have ever met in my life.  She explained on \"Prime Time\" on RT&Eacute; last night that she resigned because she simply did not have confidence in the RCOG review.  For me, this is some revelation.  On 22 October when I and the Taoiseach stood here and he apologised to the women of Ireland for what happened to them through the screening programme, I raised with him, in fact I pleaded with him, in relation to an intervention on the RCOG review because I had fears that the same mistakes were going to be repeated.  Unfortunately, he did not listen.<\/p>  <p>  Today I am asking questions on behalf of Lorraine Walsh.  The minutes of the cervical review meeting on 6 October state that over 50% of all reviews carried out by RCOG and sent to the HSE had to be sent back.  How were proper controls for this review not in place by then and that that amount had to be sent back to RCOG to be re-examined?  It has been revealed that three women, from a total of 1,051, had their slides relabelled in error as part of this process.  Two of the three women in question were Lorraine Walsh, the patient advocate, and Vicky Phelan, who revealed all of this on day one.  Statistically, what are the chances of them being two of the three women, from a total of 1,051 women, who had the labels taken off their slides and moved around onto other women's slides?  How could Lorraine Walsh get two reports from RCOG on 15 November and 16 November, one saying her report was concurrent and the other saying it was the total opposite?  How was that possible over 24 hours?  How did RCOG know that it was Lorraine Walsh's report without her confidentiality being broken?  Finally, how many women whose slides were lost or unavailable have been told as part of the RCOG review that their reports were concurrent when we do not actually know and they should be categorised as unknown?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400014#M02500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1575462000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>In fairness to the Deputy, he has asked some very specific questions, one relating to the minutes of a meeting held on 6 October last.

It is the case that some errors were made during the process of the RCOG audit.  They were flagged at the time and I am advised that they were dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  I know Lorraine Walsh too.  I have met her many times.  I read her resignation letter when it arrived on 31 October, five weeks before this report was published.  It was extraordinarily complimentary of the Minister, in particular, and of many of the people who now work in CervicalCheck.  It did not mention RCOG at all.  I appreciate that she is honest and truthful in what she has said since then, although that was not the reason that was given five weeks ago.  I want to express my appreciation and thanks to her for the work she did as a patient advocate over many months.  She certainly helped me in my work when I was putting together the apology I made in this House.  She has made a difference in helping us to improve our screening programme and to restore confidence in CervicalCheck.<\/p>  <p>  RCOG is the professional body for obstetricians and gynaecologists in the United Kingdom.

They are experts brought in from the UK because we wanted to make sure the report was totally independent.

The RCOG is the world-leading body of experts; it is independent and based in a different country.  It came in here to do this work.

That document was an open confirmation that the existing mental health services were not fit for purpose and that the rate of admissions, including involuntary admissions to hospital, was unacceptably high.  It took another 21 years, and the unnecessary suffering of a substantial number of patients and their families, for the Government of the day to acknowledge that the rate of change was abysmally slow and a new approach was required.  The latter came with A Vision for Change, which was to cover the period 2006 to 2016 and which was published after a long period of consultation and on the back of the suffering of patients and their families.  It was a visionary and comprehensive document, which, in minute detail, showed what was required to provide mental health services of an acceptable standard throughout the country.  It also took the precaution of not trusting any Government and it recommended the establishment of an independent implementation body, which was done.  That body was in place for two periods.  I do not know how many times I have mentioned this, but it did its job so well that it was abolished.  Since then, and particularly since the notional date of 2016 came and went, this Government, unfortunately, has utterly failed to implement A Vision for Change in any meaningful way.  It has refused, as a measure of bona fides, to re-establish the independent body which was so effective and instead resorted to delays and obfuscations, a desktop review, which was completed in five weeks and left sitting on a table, and a refreshing of A Vision for Change.  What is necessary is the reinstatement of the independent body and the roll-out and operation of A Vision for Change.<\/p>  <p>  I mention all of this in the context of Galway, where there is a brand new facility but no staff.  This new facility was supposed to bring change, where there are - I am not given to exaggeration - at least four delayed discharges and a number of clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and social worker posts cannot be filled.  I am told the figure is approximately 28.  The moratorium-embargo that the Taoiseach repeatedly tells us does not exist actually does exist.  One would need the help of Kafka to try to understand the language coming from the Government because I do not understand it.  I have a list of the vacancies but time precludes from going through it.  All of the applicants attended for interview, were successful and offered jobs but no sanction has been forthcoming from Dublin.  The Taoiseach tell us boldly and unacceptably that there is no moratorium.  My question to him is in regard to the &euro;12 million that supposedly cannot be spent.  I want an absolute assurance that that &euro;12 million will not go back into the coffers of the HSE and that it will be used, in the first instance, in respect of Galway such that the four delayed discharges can be immediately dealt with and other patients can be treated in the hospital and, second, to fund essential posts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400015#N00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1575462600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Mental health is an issue in which I have a great interest and one that is of major concern to the Government.  I do not agree with the contention that A Vision for Change has not been implemented at all but I do think it needs to be replaced by a new document.  It has reached the pointed where it needs to be renewed.  A lot of things have happened since A Vision for Change was first adopted.  For a start, we have moved away from treating mental illness largely in hospital settings, or psychiatric institutions as they used to be called, to community settings.  There use to be nearly 20,000 people in psychiatric hospitals and mental institutions throughout the country.  The position has totally changed.  It is now a largely community-delivered service.  That brings with it new challenges but I think it is a much better situation than in the past.  We have also seen the development, for example, of the National Office of Suicide Prevention and the success it has had in reducing suicide rates over the past couple of years and new programmes such as, for example, Jigsaw and the Children and Young People's Services Committees, CYPSC.  We have seen the progress made in recent months in reducing the waiting lists for child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, which are down by approximately 20% or 30% in the past few months and the 24-hour helpline that I launched with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, only last week.  We have over 1,000 different mental health services, but some overlap and there are gaps.  People often it difficult to find which is the right service for them at the right time.  This new service helps to point individuals in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the money the Deputy mentioned, I often hear figures like &euro;12 million, &euro;35 million and so on.  We should acknowledge, and we should at least know in this House, that the budget for mental health for 2020 is over &euro;1 billion.  It has increased from approximately &euro;750 million when this Government came to office to over &euro;1 billion now.  Of that, there is an increase of &euro;39 million for next year, comprising &euro;12 million or &euro;13 million for new developments and &euro;26 million to pay staff better and make improvements in the context of staffing, etc.  It is an extra &euro;39 million for mental health services next year and a budget of over &euro;1 billion for the first time ever.  This shows the level of resources that are required and being provided to our mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  The spend in Galway is not a matter for me.  I am sure &euro;39 million would cover those costs many times over but it is the responsibility of the national director of mental health services to decide how it is best allocated.  I am sure there are many examples of how that money could be spent all around the country but it would not be right, or possible, for me, to identify one and direct that that be done.  The national director of mental health services has to look at the entire list of things that could be done and decide how best the &euro;39 million can be spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400015#N00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1575462600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I am not sure when it is going to dawn on the Taoiseach that in order to restore faith in the political process, we need language to mean something.

While we agree with the closure of some childcare facilities and cr&egrave;ches, such as those we saw highlighted on \"Prime Time\", because they are not fit for purpose, the vast majority do a really good job in caring for and supporting our children.  They support the very fabric of our communities.  The newly introduced childcare regulations which require childcare facilities to register before 12 December are very onerous.  I know that the deadline for meeting some of the conditions has been extended until June but, at the moment, only 50% of childcare operators have registered.  On 2 January, 50% of our childcare operators may close down.  What will we do when our teachers, nurses, doctors and public servants cannot go to work?  This needs to be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400019#R00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1575465000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Zappone, is currently looking at this issue.

It is affecting individuals, families and communities throughout the country.  What might have traditionally been seen as a problem for urban areas and, more often than not, areas of social disadvantage has now become a national problem.  Illegal drugs are in every town and village in the country.  I do not say this just to put it on the record, it is backed up by all of the evidence.  If we look at the number of people who are seeking treatment for addiction or the CSO figures for drug-related offences, we will see that the figures are increasing every year.  This shows the scale of the problem we are facing.  It is interesting to note that total drug seizures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2017 were equal to those in 2015 and 2016 put together.  There is a massive quantity of illicit drugs in the country.  It is unfortunate but it needs to be put on the record that, in the last year in which drug-related deaths were counted, 2016, 736 lost their lives in this way.  This issue is having a devastating effect on many aspects of life for individuals, families and communities.<\/p><p>In recent years a new feature of this trade has developed.  Young children are being targeted and used to deliver, sell and supply drugs.  This was very well explained in research undertaken by the Blanchardstown Local Drugs and Alcohol Task Force, which was published earlier this year.  It brought to light the fact that the service had seen children as young as ten dealing drugs.  It has actually came across one eight year old drug runner.  It is appalling to think that children of that age are being groomed and targeted.  Their lives are being ruined because once they get into that vicious cycle, it is very difficult to get away.  They are being targeted because those who are using them often feel that there are fewer or lesser criminal consequences for young people than for other people who are caught.  They are being used, abused and targeted by other people in the drug distribution chain.<\/p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce two new criminal offences.  It would become an offence to purchase drugs from a person under the age of 18.  This puts a responsibility on people who are using drugs.  If they buy drugs from a person under the age of 18 they will not just be charged with using or possessing; it would be a new aggravated offence to purchase drugs from a minor.<\/p><p>It would also be an offence to cause a child to be in possession of drugs with intent to supply.  Those who are operating the distribution systems and using children as distributors and sellers of drugs would be committing an offence.  While this will not solve our drug problem, it will offer a degree of protection to young people who are in a vulnerable position, who are being targeted and whose future is being taken away from them.<\/p> <p>I hope these new offences will protect the young people in question.  I look forward to bringing this legislation to the D&aacute;il at the earliest possible opportunity and I will be looking for co-operation from all sides to enact it at an early date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400019#R01800","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575465600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1575465600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575465600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1575465600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1575465600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S00600","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575465600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2019: Referral to Joint Committee","time":1575465600,"counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1575465600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Regulations in draft:  \tPlanning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2019, a copy of which has been laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 2nd December, 2019, be referred to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(4)(<i>k<\/i>), which, not later than 10th December, 2019, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall  accordingly apply.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S00900","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575465600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna (At\u00f3g\u00e1il) - Questions (Resumed)","time":1575465600,"counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation Expenditure","time":1575465600,"counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S01200"},{"type":"question","time":1575465600,"counter":350,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[47365\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400020#S01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the projected costs of the Commission of Investigation into the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1575465600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Following consultations with the Opposition parties by the then Minister for Finance, the IBRC commission of investigation was established in June 2015.

The reply the Taoiseach just read out confirms that this remains the case.  To be frank, people are scratching their heads.

Can the Taoiseach comment on that?  We cannot allow the truth to be buried or allow the surging costs to undermine the credibility of the commission.  Given the fresh legal actions that are under way, is the Taoiseach willing to further extend the deadline beyond March?  If so, under what conditions?  Can the Taoiseach provide an updated figure for the projected costs?  I heard him refer to &euro;30 million but, as I said, knowledgeable commentary is now suggesting a cost of &euro;100 million.  This Government is facing a crisis in the context of its credibility in dealing with significant matters of public interest.  We really need an answer from the Taoiseach.  The Dara Murphy affair has cast a pall on the Taoiseach's reputation.  He probably had nothing to do with it other than facilitating Dara Murphy in going to Europe, which is really strange when the latter's job was to be a Deputy here.

The individual transaction of greatest public concern happened over a period of months, but it has now been investigated for a period of years.  Every single email, text message and document generated within the IBRC and those approaching it could have been examined by now.  The Taoiseach adopted a stance of studied indifference when this was raised in June.  The fact is that this commission is investigating a matter of major public, not just Opposition, concern.  While the Oireachtas has set the terms of the legislation, it is the Taoiseach and the Government which have direct responsibility for communication with the commission on all matters.

We accept that it is only an estimate.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the timeframe for reporting, the accountability for the commission of investigation is set out in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  The establishment of a commission is by way of a Government order that has been approved in draft by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The order identifies a specified Minister who is responsible for receiving the interim and final reports, for granting any extensions of timeframe, and for other administrative tasks.  As the Members are aware, the previous Taoiseach and I consulted Oireachtas representatives at every stage where a decision was required on IBRC.  Following a request from the commission in its fourth interim report, which I received on 10 June, I extended the reporting deadline to the end of this year.  I have no information to indicate that the deadline will not be met.  Based on this, we anticipate another report before the end of this year, and we will see if that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400021#T00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"British-Irish Council","time":1575466200,"counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400021#T00400"},{"type":"question","time":1575466200,"counter":359,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[48539\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400021#T00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his attendance at the 33rd British-Irish Council.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1575466200,"counter":360,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[47640\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400021#T00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his hosting of the recent British-Irish Council summit.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1575466200,"counter":361,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[48831\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400021#T00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if corporation tax was discussed at the British-Irish Council when it met in Farmleigh recently; and if comments were made about corporation tax in Northern Ireland.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1575466200,"counter":362,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[48844\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400021#T00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his hosting of the recent British-Irish Council summit.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1575466200,"counter":363,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[50113\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400021#T00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his hosting of the recent British-Irish Council summit.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1575466200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to welcome the administration heads from Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey and the British Government to Dublin for the 33rd British-Irish Council on 15 November.  This year marks the 20th anniversary of the inaugural meeting of the British-Irish Council, BIC, and it was agreed that the council continues to be a valued institution of the Good Friday Agreement.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was present, as were civil servants from Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The summit heard from health ministers from each administration who met that morning to discuss health and social initiatives to combat substance misuse, in particular the enhanced, innovative addiction treatment and rehabilitation services that will be central to tackling problematic drug and alcohol use in Dublin's north-east inner-city. The Ministers explored the links between health and social initiatives and community policing, and their long-term social and economic benefits to communities.  In advance of the summit meeting on Thursday evening, health ministers from the travelling delegations visited the Dublin north-east inner-city inclusion health hub, a project that focuses on the transformation of the delivery of health services for drug users in the city.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of corporation tax was not discussed, but the BIC summit provided an opportunity for ministers to update the council on their actions regarding Brexit and to discuss the latest domestic political developments across their jurisdictions, along with topics of mutual interest such as the economy, trade and ongoing relations with the European Union.

There are questions over the constitutional futures of both islands.  It is necessary that we have a forum to continue to forge the east-west relationship.  No matter what the changes will be, it is essential to maintain strong links between both islands during this period.<\/p>  <p>  For the past two meetings of the BIC, however, the UK Prime Minister in office, Theresa May, and more recently, Boris Johnson, have failed to attend the summit and have had deputies attend on their behalf.  This is regrettable, particularly given the Taoiseach's own dedicated attendance.<\/p>  <p>  Yet again there has been no elected representation for the people of Northern Ireland because of the ongoing paralysis at Stormont.  I welcome the hints at the moment that there could be another set of Christmas discussions.

I welcome any move by the two parties in Stormont perhaps to begin serious conversations when the British general election is over.<\/p>  <p>  It is 20 years since the first meeting of the council.  Does the Taoiseach feel it is now appropriate to review the role?  If the British-Irish Council is to have a serious future, does the Taoiseach have any confidence that the next Prime Minister of the UK after the current election will attend the 34th summit in Scotland next year?  We would all look forward to it also if the Northern Ireland parties, especially the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, could indicate that they might foresee their presence in Scotland next year.  Will the Taoiseach outline his own view of the future role of the BIC, particularly in the context of Brexit, and will he commit to stressing this view and pressing the importance of the British-Irish Council to the next UK Prime Minister after the election on 12 December?

I pointed out the familiarity that had built up over nearly 50 years of common membership of the EU and how essential that was to good relationships between the two Governments and peoples.  The Taoiseach's reply was a very general one that did not go beyond what had been said for well over a year, that is, some form of altered British-Irish Council was being considered.  I would have thought that, at this stage, this matter should have gone beyond generalities.  The number of areas where regular contacts are required to maintain the broad features of, for example, the common travel area is wide and cannot be addressed by having a few more set-piece summits.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to consult on this matter or publish anything?  Has he discussed a process with the British to start getting something more specific?  We have mentioned the Nordic Council as a potential model for future British-Irish structures post Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  We will soon reach the third anniversary of the collapse of the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland because of a controversy surrounding a heating scheme.  It is a great pity that the Dublin media has paid so little attention to the details of the inquiry into that heating scheme, given that it has confirmed to everyone the core dysfunction that was operating in the DUP-Sinn F&eacute;in controlled Executive.  One element of this was the secret structures whereby Sinn F&eacute;in ministers were controlled by non-elected people.  The even more pervasive point was how each party was allowed to promote its own interests and other parties were systematically excluded.<\/p>  <p>  Should the two parties find a way to work together again, and I hope they do, what cannot be allowed to happen is the continued marginalisation of other parties and groups.  An essential part of ensuring that is to restore a civic forum.  This is not an option - it is a requirement of the agreement.  Another essential move must be an end to the practice whereby the leaders of the two larger parties in the Executive and their advisers get to control even basic information and the flow of same, denying others the right to debate issues before everything is agreed between the two larger parties.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that the Government is seeking the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, not just those parts of it on which the two larger parties are focused?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400022#U00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1575466800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I note that health ministers met as part of the British-Irish Council.  I would be interested to know whether they were aware of the alarming similarities in the crises in the health services in the North, South and Britain.  Today, health workers in the North are on strike.  On 18 December, nurses will come out on strike.  They are on work to rule today.  Other health workers are already on strike because of a shocking inequality between health workers in the NHS in the North and those in Britain.  Health workers in the North get paid less - they have caps on their pay - than their equivalents in Britain.  This shocking inequality was initially supported by DUP health ministers in the Assembly and maintained by Ms Michelle O'Neill of Sinn F&eacute;in when she was health minister in 2017.  Just as People Before Profit said to nurses when they went out on strike for decent pay and conditions in the South, we fully support health workers in the North fighting for pay parity.  What is at stake is the quality of health services in the North, which are suffering exactly the same problems as ours are, namely, massively high waiting lists, huge overcrowding and terrible conditions for health workers.  As a result, they cannot recruit enough health workers and others are leaving to work for agencies or leaving the country altogether.  That sounds familiar, does it not?  In the worst way, there are similarities between the North, South and Britain in terms of the mistreatment of and underinvestment in our health services.  We should all support the nurses and other health workers in the North who are taking industrial action to remedy that inequality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400022#U00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1575466800,"counter":370,"content":"<p>When it comes to the British-Irish Council it has not been the norm for the UK Prime Minister to attend since its inception.  I think that Mr. David Cameron may have attended one of the meetings, perhaps in London, or a few during his term of office, but it has been the norm since its inception to send a different senior Cabinet minister to attend the British-Irish Council to represent the UK Government.<\/p><p>In terms of the future role, I believe that both the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council can have an enhanced future role after Brexit, with the British-Irish Council perhaps taking responsibility for monitoring issues around the common travel area, maybe even security co-operation as well as co-operation among the regions, and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council, which really operates on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, becoming more permanent and more structured with regular meetings, perhaps one summit once a year involving the two Heads of Government, with bilateral meetings involving ministers and their teams.  When the UK leaves the European Union, we will still have a lot to talk about and we will not have the opportunity to meet four or five times a year in Brussels as we do now.<\/p><p>I know Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin mentioned the Nordic Council as a potential model.  I think that is a something that we need to examine.  The intention now is to take it up with the Prime Minister after the British elections, which will happen next week.<\/p><p>Regarding the Scottish independence referendum, First Minister Sturgeon took the opportunity to brief me on her thoughts and plans about it.  She informed me that it was her intention, and the intention of the Scottish Government, to have a second referendum in Scotland on independence in the next number of years.  Of course, the Scottish Government will need the consent of the UK Government to do that.  That may depend on the outcome of the elections next week as well.<\/p><p>On the general situation in Northern Ireland, it is very dynamic at the moment.  There are a lot of moving parts.  One is the outcome of the Westminster elections next week, which will impact on who will be the Prime Minister and in the Cabinet and whether the next Government has a majority or not.  Also, there is still uncertainty about Brexit and whether the withdrawal agreement can be ratified.  There is a potential in the next couple of weeks for us to get some certainty, both on the composition of the UK Government and also on the UK's intentions with regard to Brexit.  I think that creates the opportunity for talks to resume in Northern Ireland around re-establishing the institutions and getting them functioning again and also around the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the problems that were being experienced in the health service in Northern Ireland.  I make a point of at least looking at the front pages of all the Northern Ireland newspapers every day.  He is absolutely right.  There are major problems in the health service in Northern Ireland that are not dissimilar to the ones faced here, in Britain or, indeed, in very many jurisdictions around the western world.  The front page of the <i>Belfast Telegraph <\/i>for the past three or four days has been leading with health stories around the strikes, problems with cancer tests, problems with waiting lists and access.  It is sadly a feature of the vast majority of public health services in the western world to different extents.  The extents do vary, but the problems are very similar - waiting times, overcrowding in emergency departments and difficulty recruiting and retaining staff.  I know that the German health minister is currently seeking 50,000 more nurses.  The UK's NHS talks about, I think, 100,000 vacancies.  Even the whole issue of overspending - health trusts and so on not being able to stick to budget - is very similar, albeit to different extents and different levels of severity in different jurisdictions.<\/p><p>We should say one thing about our health service that often gets missed.  The focus is always on overcrowding and trolleys, and I understand why that is the case, but we do not focus on - this is unfair on our health service and our health service staff - patient outcomes enough.<\/p> <p>For example, somebody who gets cancer in Ireland has a better chance of survival than somebody who gets cancer and is treated by the NHS in Scotland, England, Wales or Northern Ireland.  We are seeing real improvements in patient outcomes with regard to stroke, heart attack and life expectancy.  All of these patient outcomes and indicators in our health service are going in the right direction.  This does not happen by accident.  It happens because of investment, good strategies, good policies and the phenomenal work of the staff in the health service.  This should be recognised more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400022#U00400","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575467400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government cancer and heart strategies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400023#V00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1575467400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>We will pat you on the back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400023#V00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","time":1575467400,"counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400023#V00350"},{"type":"question","time":1575467400,"counter":375,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[47831\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400023#V00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the parliamentary liaison unit in his Department.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1575467400,"counter":376,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[48733\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400023#V00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the parliamentary liaison unit.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1575467400,"counter":377,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[49131\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400023#V00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the way in which his Department supports the Independent Ministers of Government as outlined in the Statement of Strategy 2016-2019 of his Department.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1575467400,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department assists the Taoiseach and the Government, including the Independent members of Government, through the Government secretariat, the programme for Government office, the Cabinet committee structure, and the parliamentary liaison unit.

There are 55 such Bills, including all of those of People Before Profit, which have all passed Second Stage.  The Bills include the Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill, the Anti-Evictions Bill and the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill.<\/p>  <p>  What I am curious about is how the Government assesses what requires a money message.  It seems there is clearly an abuse of the money message provision and it is being used for political purposes.  There seems to be no consistency or objectivity in deciding what supposedly has a cost.  Even though the Bills clearly are not Bills about spending money or raising taxes, arbitrarily the Government declares there will be costs, but there is no consistency in that application.  The only rationale appears to be political.  I would like the Taoiseach to admit this and that politics rather than actual costs is dictating the use of the money message by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example because I asked the Clerk about this.  I asked him what Bills do not require money messages.  He said referendum Bills do not.  I said that was very strange because referendums cost a lot of money.  Why would they not require a money message while a Bill to stop issuing fossil fuel licences to oil and gas companies, which would cost the Government hardly anything, does require a money message?  This exposes the abuse, and there is no other word for it, but I want the Taoiseach to prove me wrong.  There are actually no objective fair criteria for the deployment of the money message other than partisan politics, because some things do not require a money message even though they could well be argued to have a cost and other things do require one even though they clearly would not have a significant cost other than minor incidental costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400023#V00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1575467400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I want to speak about some messages to the Taoiseach in particular in the context of the parliamentary liaison unit.

The Department of the Taoiseach is obliged to have a statement of strategy.  My understanding is that the statement of strategy for the Department will reach its end date this month.  We do not know how long this fractured Government has left as we move into 2020.  It might be a month, two months or three months.  We know that in the by-elections, to use a bingo analogy, the Government got neither a full house nor a line.  In none of the four constituencies did Government candidates win seats.  I would like to know what the thoughts of the Department of Taoiseach are for 2020.  As stated, it is obliged to have a statement of strategy in place.  As the Taoiseach acknowledged in the past 48 hours, housing is one of the big challenges facing this State.  It is a huge issue that is pressing down on people.  Despite the fact Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies sat on their hands last night and abstained, they were unable to express confidence in the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This is the big issue.  It is one of the major challenges we face, as are health, childcare and a host of other matters.  The issue regarding housing is enormous.  The statement of strategy, which reaches its end date this month, notes that the Department \"has a responsibility to ensure that policies developed uphold the Government&rsquo;s commitment to develop Ireland in a sustainable way which fosters economic development and social progress\".  From our perspective, the big issue in the context of social progress is housing.  As already stated, I would like to know if the Department of the Taoiseach intends to put in placed a new statement of strategy for 2020 or is the Taoiseach accepting that this fractured Government is dying on its feet and might only have a couple of weeks left as we go into 2020?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400024#W00900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1575468000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I confirm that no promises were made to Independent Deputies in return for votes on the confidence motion and there is nothing to publish.

It was attended by all the local Members of the Oireachtas - Deputies and Senators - and the local county councillors, as well as the Garda inspector at Shannon.  It was well attended, with more than 700 people, and was a call to us as Members to highlight the issues facing villages such as Newmarket-on-Fergus, which is a case study of what is happening to many villages and towns throughout Ireland.  Newmarket-on-Fergus is a town close to Shannon and Ennis that has been bypassed by the M18 and it should do better than it does, which is the point people wished to highlight to the local Oireachtas Members.  The problem is mirrored throughout rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The issues raised included the lack of basic services, amenities and facilities in the village; the fact that all the shops and many pubs have closed; the poor streetscape; and the lack of proper lighting, footpaths and public transport.  Anxieties were also raised about policing services not being visible or being at a remove from Newmarket-on-Fergus.  The town has a small station, which is manned infrequently for a few hours per week, and the policing service comes from Shannon.  The issues in that regard were the lack of visibility of garda&iacute; on the ground, a slow response time when the Garda is contacted, and a great deal of anti-social behaviour and illegal drug-taking.  There is great concern that such activity is happening in a small village.  There has also been a loss of GP services.  A long-standing GP in Newmarket-on-Fergus retired last May but a replacement has not been found, which is a source of great anxiety for the community because people have to travel to Shannon or Ennis for a service.  There is a lack of support for the public health nurse, the community intervention schemes, and home helps and voluntary groups in general.  The loss of a GP is a substantial issue.<\/p>  <p>  The story is familiar throughout Ireland and demonstrates how easily the fabric of a rural society can unravel.  Newmarket-on-Fergus has benefited from supports from the Government and from the town and village renewal scheme, through which it received &euro;200,000 in 2017.  It received &euro;500,000 from LEADER and &euro;200,000 from a local philanthropic fund - the Tomar Trust - and it produced &euro;300,000 of its own money to build community services in the area.  Obair, the local community service, provides services from the cradle to the grave, including elderly services, unemployment services, a community cr&egrave;che and meals on wheels, the last of which extend throughout south Clare, to Quin, Durra, Newcastle, Bunratty, Kilkishen, Kilmurry and Sixmilebridge.  It is an extensive service that radiates from the town centre and the funding for it was welcome.  It has a community caf&eacute; and educational courses.<\/p>  <p>  Newmarket-on-Fergus has received substantial funding.  Nevertheless, the issues raised on Monday night were cross-departmental.  They spanned health, transport, housing, justice and education, and how the town interacted with the county council.  The residents highlighted that while they have been given support, there is much more they could do if they were given additional supports.  Not least in respect of policing, medical services and the upkeep and structure of the village, they believe that a great deal more could be done for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400025#DD00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1575468600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>We appreciate the voluntary work that is done and the services provided in rural Ireland by voluntary groups.

The Deputy's question was general but he also focused on Newmarket-on-Fergus, which is fine.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubting the challenges faced by rural towns and villages, especially in the face of a changing retail environment and as people move away from town centre living.  The Government is acutely aware of the need to support and revitalise towns and villages.  This is a central objective of our investment in Project Ireland 2040 that is being backed up by an investment of &euro;1 billion under the rural regeneration and development fund.  It is worth highlighting the significant investment taking place in towns and villages and the many positive stories emerging throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2016, I have announced &euro;68 million for more than 830 projects under the town and village renewal scheme, the sole purpose of which is the revitalisation of towns and villages.  This year alone, I have announced funding of &euro;15 million for 156 projects under the scheme, six of which are based in County Clare and will receive funding of more than &euro;720,000.  I have also approved funding of &euro;86 million under the first call for proposals under the rural regeneration and development fund.  Last month, I announced the successful projects from the second call, with 26 projects approved for funding of &euro;62 million.  In total, I have announced funding of &euro;9.2 million from the rural regeneration and development fund for ten projects located in County Clare.  This is a considerable investment in our towns and villages that will have benefits for decades.  We are also focused on identifying policy solutions to the challenges facing our towns and villages.  For example, my Department has supported a pilot scheme to encourage six rural towns and villages.  Funding has been made available to each of the towns to assist in developing innovative proposals to encourage town centre living.  It is envisaged that the lessons learned through the pilot scheme can help to inform the approach to supporting and investing in rural towns and villages in the future.<\/p>  <p>  As for Newmarket-on-Fergus in particular, additional funds have been sought from my Department for a specific project that has significant potential for the community there.  I have directly engaged with the group involved to explore the options available to it.

It has developed services out of the Tradaree centre, which is where most of the services I outlined are delivered from.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue with housing.  There are up to 60 derelict buildings in the small town, yet a planning application has been submitted for a new housing estate.  It would make much more sense if the derelict and vacant buildings within the village structure were supported to bring them to a level whereby they could be used as accommodation for families or single people, which would restore vitality to the village, rather than building a new housing estate, which would have to go through the planning process and jump through various regulatory hoops.  A great deal of the vacant accommodation could be used to accommodate people rather than building a new estate.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue raised was cross-departmental, given that it is under the remit of the Office of Public Works, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Clare County Council.  There was flooding on the rail line at Ballycar between Limerick and Ennis, which passes through Newmarket-on-Fergus.  Flooding can interrupt services on the rail line for up to three or four months in a wet winter but it is an important component of the western rail corridor.  The issue needs to be addressed, although there are turf wars among the State bodies I mentioned over which of them is responsible.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that and bring it to the attention of other relevant Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400025#DD00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1575469200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Harty for the spirit in which he raised this matter.  I work across Government with all Ministers and have to make sure that all legislation and everything that happens at Cabinet is rural-proofed.  The Deputy raised a valid point.  I have to speak to the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Government.  We set up a pilot scheme for six towns to deal with vacant properties in towns and villages, which is a major issue.<\/p>  <p>  A real difficulty for the retail sector in this country is online shopping.  It affects retail, jobs and people.  We are coming into the Christmas season and the busiest people all over the country will be couriers, which is having a major effect on our shopkeepers, jobs and rural services.  My Department is examining this issue.  I gave each of the six towns in the pilot scheme &euro;100,000 and asked them to come back to me with suggestions and ideas.  Even before that happened, I looked at a preliminary report.  One issue was vacant houses, to which Deputy Harty referred.<\/p>  <p>  Some people will not like what I am about to say.  Many on the left think nobody should make a profit.  If somebody has a property, there is nothing wrong with the State giving that person support to renovate it and make it available for rent.  Some people do not support the ideology I support, but I believe that people are entitled to make a profit if they have properties.  If we can encourage people in towns and villages, in particular, to make their properties available for rent, that would help the rental sector and revitalise towns.  There is no point in pretending otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  Retail will not return to towns and villages any day soon as long as people are shopping online.  Millions of euro are spent online every year.  It is a significant challenge for rural Ireland.  The town and village scheme, outdoor recreation scheme, CL&Aacute;R programme and the urban regeneration scheme have revitalised many towns and villages and created many jobs.

Parents of children with special needs come to me in a state of distress every week.  Very often they are worn out, not because their children have special needs but because they are exhausted from having to fight for school places and the basic services they need so that their children can have a quality of life.  My heart goes out to them because I know the battle they are facing every single day to ensure that the education and special supports their children are entitled to are provided.  Waiting times in Wexford for special needs assessments are unacceptable.  Many children are waiting years for the approval of services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy.  This is simply wrong.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I want to focus on the lack of school places for children with special needs.  Last year, over 850 children with special needs across Ireland received home tuition because spaces could not be found for them in schools.  Many of these children are in my home county of Wexford.  Many schools in Wexford do not have adequate facilities or spaces for children with special needs.  Mainstream schools and special schools have long waiting lists.  In Enniscorthy, there are long waiting lists for support classes in St. Aidan's and St. Senan's primary schools.  St. Senan's primary school has been waiting at stage 2 for a new build, which includes badly needed special needs classes, for the fourth longest period of time in the country.  St. Aidan's primary school has been approved for an additional classroom, but has not received approval to go to tender.  This needs to happen immediately to provide the additional classroom which is badly needed this September.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that a new building for St. Patrick's special school is being built in Enniscorthy, but it started two years after it was promised.  Meanwhile, the principal, teachers, special needs assistants and students have to endure Dickensian conditions in the existing building.<\/p>  <p>  Our Lady of Fatima special school in Wexford town is a remarkable school with a wonderful principal in Rita Waters, outstanding staff and special children.  The conditions in which teachers at the school have to teach and children have to learn are simply not acceptable.  The car park doubles as a schoolyard and a bus collection point, which is dangerous and unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Many special schools across the country are waiting up to 13 years for new builds that are badly needed.  There are severe problems throughout County Wexford, including in New Ross, Gorey, Wexford and Enniscorthy.  Schools that cannot take children are very often not provided with the resources and training that teachers and special needs assistants need to uphold every child's right to an education.  Very often, the provision of special needs assistants in schools who can provide the necessary support for students and teachers is inefficient.  Appeals are often turned down, but it is impossible for principals to know why that happened. <\/p>  <p>  For those children who cannot get a place in a mainstream or special school, parents often apply to every school in the county and beyond.  This is not a solution and it is impossible where both parents are working.  More importantly, all children want to go to school where their friends and neighbours attend school.  It is distressing for any young child, but especially a child with special needs, to have to travel long distances every day for basic schooling needs and to go to an area where he or she does not know anybody.  The only alternative to this is home schooling, which is not a substitute for an appropriate school place unless it is clinically advised.  Children are missing out on developing social skills and the opportunity to mix with other children, and all of the benefits that come from that for any child.  It can be very destructive to a home environment and where both parents are working, it can be almost impossible to manage.  Ultimately, it is not right for the child.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to deal with these issues, commit to an appropriate number of special classes in County Wexford, ensure every child has a right to access education and publish an implementation plan as soon as possible for County Wexford to ensure that children have adequate school places and supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400026#EE00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1575469200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of education for children with special needs is an ongoing priority for the Government.  Currently, almost 20% of the total education Vote, or &euro;1.9 billion, is invested in supporting children with special needs.  The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and special needs assistants are at unprecedented levels.  Nationally, 167 new special classes opened for the 2019-20 school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place compared with 548 in 2011.  Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  The majority of children with autism attend mainstream classes, where they may access additional supports if required.  <\/p>  <p>  Some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placements in mainstream classes and, therefore, placement in a special class or special school setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services for children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the HSE.  The council has well established structures in place to plan and co-ordinate special education provision throughout the country.  This includes identifying the need for and establishing special class placements in various geographical areas where they are required.  It ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.<\/p>  <p>  Normally, special classes are established with the full co-operation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the council has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special classes or school places.  I know that this can cause much anguish for the parents and families involved.  In County Wexford, there are currently two special schools and 60 special classes in mainstream schools, including four ASD early intervention classes, 33 primary ASD classes and 15 ASD post-primary ASD classes.  Seven of the ASD classes are new for the 2019-20 school year.  All newly assigned teachers to special classes and schools with newly established special classes undergo a suite of professional development provided by the NCSE through its network of advisers.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and Skills has the power under section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and, ultimately, a ministerial direction made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available.  The Minister for Education and Skills is prepared to use the legislation when necessary to ensure that children can access a suitable education.  However, the preference is for schools to engage with this challenge on a voluntary basis because it is the right thing for the children in their community.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, the NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others throughout the country to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.  The Department of Education and Skills is not aware of any significant unmet need for additional places in County Wexford.  If the Deputy has information in this regard, I will arrange for it to be passed on to the NCSE.  Special education needs officers are available at a local level to support parents and schools on the placement of students.  I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400026#EE00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1575469800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>There is a constitutional right to primary education and education in general.  This right was placed in our Constitution in 1937, which was very far-sighted at the time because such a right was not a common then.  It is crucial that this right be upheld and vindicated for every child, no matter what his or her personal situation.  Some 850 children could not get places last year, including some in my county.  For example, one parent's child was placed on a list at two years of age.  The child is now four and a half years old and is 17th on the waiting list for a place at one of the schools in my home town.  All the places on offer have been taken.  The other school in the town is also full.  There is a problem.  Perhaps there may be spaces available at the other end of the county which could be used to accommodate children.  However, this approach would not be suitable where a child wants to remain in his or her local community or in situations where both parents work.  It is not appropriate for a child with special needs to be travelling the length of the county.  It is neither practical nor right.<\/p>  <p>  That situation is replicated across Wexford, so I cannot understand the NCSE stating that there is no issue in the county.  I regularly meet parents who are in a very distressed state.  That is before we even get into the financial distress experienced by parents who have to spend a great deal of money to get occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy that they cannot access from the State.  Parents are struggling every day and have a constant fight to get the supports they need.  There is a real sense of anguish for these people, because they want the best for their children.  Those parents know that every year their children are held back means it is going to be harder for them to catch up and live full and fulfilling lives as they get older.  I do not get the sense that the Department and the State are taking this issue as seriously as they should.  I know the benefits that can accrue to children with special needs because my goddaughter has Down's syndrome.  She is in St. Patrick's special school where she is getting wonderful support.  When children cannot get places in such schools or access the supports they need, they fall behind and that adds to their distress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400027#FF00100","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1575469800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The State, the Government and the Department take this issue very seriously.

There are also four places in ASD post-primary special classes, with two in north Wexford and two in Bunclody.

That is an increase of more than 50%.  When I entered the D&aacute;il in 2011, the number of special education classes stood at approximately 500.  There are more than 1,600 classes today.

I am disappointed that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has not got the time, inclination or interest to be here to discuss such an important issue.  He has no problem, however, travelling to Limerick next week to participate in the opening of what is referred to as the health science academy at University Hospital Limerick.  I will read what was stated about that facility, namely, \"In collaboration with the University of Limerick, UL, and the mid-west community healthcare organisation, CHO, UL hospital group have developed a health science academy with an emphasis on research, education and training programmes, which will have clear outcomes for patients and impact patient care\".  The opening has been postponed by two weeks because the last time the Minister for Health was supposed to be present to perform the opening and showboat for the cameras, some 85 patients in the hospital were on trolleys.  That event was cancelled hastily, and the Minister was able to duck his responsibility of dealing with the crisis at the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows full well, and this is no fault of his, that over the past four years the annual number of patients on trolleys has almost quadrupled.  In 2012, there were 3,626 patients on trolleys according to the yearly count.  This year, the figure is 12,810 and that is only up to 28 November.  That is an appalling situation.<\/p>  <p>  I can go through case after case of constituents of mine who are affected because the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick deals with patients in three counties, as well as Limerick city.  People contact my office daily to tell me about outrageous situations endured by elderly and sick people.  An example is that of a farmer in his 70s who was rushed to the hospital when he collapsed on his farm.  He remained on a trolley in the accident and emergency unit for almost three days, while still in his dirty farming clothes.  He was located beside a patient with an ulcerated leg.  It was not possible for his clothes to be changed or for him to have a shower.  That man remained on the trolley for almost three days until he was transferred to a ward.  That is an appalling situation and is just one of many such cases I hear about daily.  People in their 90s are spending 48 hours in what is an accident and emergency department, where the lights are on and there is no capacity to get some sleep.  It is a terrible situation in which to treat someone.  The nurses and doctors I talk to, who are not alarmist, are saying it is impossible for them to do their job.  They cannot get medical equipment through to check blood pressure because of the way the trolleys are stuffed into the space.  What we do not want is the Minister coming down to have his photograph taken again outside and inside some new development that is going to benefit people in the future, or at least that is how it is being presented.  I want to see the Minister appoint someone, before the end of this week, with a budget and the capacity to look at all of the resources available in the mid-west region and then to try to use them to the greatest extent.<\/p>  <p>  There are closed beds, wards and areas that can be reopened.  We need to end this rubbish talk of there not being an embargo on the employment of nurses and doctors, because there is one.  That topic has been raised in this House in recent days.  There are nurses prepared to come back to this country if they are given full-time contracts.  This is a serious situation.  I am not crying wolf.  I do not play that game.  I understand how these things work, but a life will be lost unnecessarily - if lives have not already been lost unnecessarily - because of the overcrowded conditions in which nurses and doctors are expected to deliver services.

The Minister for Health wishes to acknowledge the distress that overcrowded accident and emergency departments cause to patients, their families and the front-line staff working in challenging conditions in hospitals all across the country.  The number of patients attending accident and emergency departments continues to increase year-on-year.  For the first ten months of 2019, the number of patients attending hospital accident and emergency departments increased by 2.7% and the number of admissions to accident and emergency departments has increased by 0.9% compared to the same period last year.  The emergency department at UHL, is one of the busiest in the country.  As such, the hospital and the CHO were identified as one of the nine focus sites requiring additional investment, focus and support last winter.<\/p>  <p>  According to HSE TrolleyGAR data, there was a 16% increase in patients waiting on trolleys year-to-date in UHL emergency department in October 2019 compared with the same period last year.  In October, however, 883 patients were counted on trolleys in UHL, which was a 1.6% decrease compared with the previous month.  It is acknowledged that this figure is unacceptably high and the HSE is actively working with the UL hospital group to ease congestion in UHL, with a focus on facilitating transfers to Level 2 hospitals, assistance from rehabilitation units and CHO services, and prioritisation of diagnostics to aid inpatient discharges.  The HSE winter plan was launched on Thursday, 14 November in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period.<\/p> <p>The Government has allocated an additional &euro;26 million to fund the implementation of the winter plan.  Each winter action team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the plan.  The integrated winter plan for University Hospital Limerick will be delivered by winter action team 3.  The initiatives for winter action team 3 include additional home support hours to facilitate early hospital-to-community transfers, additional aids and appliances to facilitate early hospital discharge and emergency department avoidance, mobile doctor service units to manage increased demand for home visits and to facilitate emergency department avoidance, a low-level domiciliary rehab team in Limerick city to facilitate early discharge and emergency department avoidance, additional triage nursing support in Shannondoc to support emergency department avoidance, an additional registrar in UHL to help in addressing workflow and improving patient experience times and additional health care assistant supports in University Hospital Limerick to provide staffing at ward level to support additional surge patients.<\/p> <p> A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at University Hospital Limerick, with funding of an additional &euro;10 million allocated in 2019.  The HSE has advised that the enabling works are complete and the main contractor has commenced work.  It is anticipated that the construction will be completed in 2020.  This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region.  It is recognised that there is a deficit in diagnostic capacity at University Hospital Limerick.  A capital development proposal for an extension of the radiology department at University Hospital Limerick to include a second MRI unit has been prioritised by the HSE to progress to design stage in 2020.  In the interim, the University of Limerick Hospitals Group has tendered for a modular MRI managed service.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund will work with the HSE to fund the activity associated with the MRI scanner as part of the agreed extension in the fund's support for hospital emergency departments for diagnostics at the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400027#FF00500","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575470400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>All of that sounds fantastic, but the reality is that it is not having an impact on the ground.

Such a person should report to the Minister on a daily basis with identified outcomes, actions that will address the seriousness of the situation and workflows that will ensure the numbers on trolleys return to the normal average that exists.

Over the past two winter periods, an additional 25 beds have opened in Limerick, including eight as part of the 2018-19 winter plan.  The new emergency department, which opened in May 2017, provides modern and safe facilities that are fit for purpose and meet the expectations of patients and families.  The high-quality accommodation provided at this new facility better protects privacy and dignity.

The inaction of the Minister for Health with regard to a report that is on his desk is the key source of the problem at the hospital in Portlaoise.  The proposal that has been on the Minister's desk since September 2017 involves the full closure of the emergency, maternity and paediatric care departments at the hospital, as well as the cessation of all inpatient surgery there.  A small amount of such surgery is taking place there at the moment.  The report in question, which was prepared on foot of detailed consultation by the HSE and senior management in the Department of Health, has been left sitting on the Minister's desk for more than two years.  Therefore, the position set out in the report remains the current position of the HSE and the senior management personnel.  The Minister's inaction is causing serious problems.  It is undermining current services in the hospital.  Why would people seek to take up employment in the hospital as consultants, surgeons, doctors, non-consultant doctors, nurses or care staff when they know this cloud is hanging over it as a consequence of the Minister's failure to take action?<\/p>  <p>  The previous Topical Issue debate showed us what happens when an accident and emergency department is closed in a region without the promised additional facilities being provided in the locations where patients are expected to go.  That is the state we are at.  According to this report, the closure of the services at Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise that I have mentioned would necessitate the provision of a minimum of &euro;140 million to upgrade services at Tullamore and Naas hospitals and to facilitate the transfer of all births in Portlaoise hospital to the Coombe Hospital.  That money is simply not available.  It cannot and should not happen.  We are formally asking the Minister to visit Portlaoise and to make a positive statement on the future of the hospital there.  The current level of services should be supported and all necessary funds should be provided for consultant posts to facilitate the development of services into the future.  Parts of County Laois are only an hour from Dublin.  People in County Laois are used to travelling to St. James's Hospital for critical hospital surgeries.  We are all familiar with that.  Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, St. James's Hospital and the Coombe Hospital are part of the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  It is good that complicated births are transferred from Portlaoise to the Coombe.  More than 400 children were delivered in Portlaoise hospital last year.  I would say the hospital got close attention in the form of HIQA reports, etc., as a result of the controversy of some years ago.  As I have said previously, the circumstances of the death of a child in the hospital were covered up by senior HSE management.<\/p> <p>It took a great deal of legal work to establish that.  People knew that a child had died at the hospital and HSE senior management covered it up.  While there were with no repercussions for the HSE, the reputation of the hospital was damaged.  Following on from the HIQA inspections, most people will accept that maternity services at Portlaoise hospital over the past two or three year have been among the safest in the country.  I am not aware of any maternal or infant death on delivery in recent times.  As a result of a light having been shone on the facility it has improved.<\/p> <p> It would be a shame if the Minister were to proceed with the closure of the maternity services and emergency department.  If the emergency department is closed, the maternity ward would have to be closed because it would not be safe.  We need confirmation that the emergency department will continue to operate 24-7, 365 days of the year, as it currently does.  If the Minister would confirm that, we could get on with the future development of the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400028#GG00700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575471000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I do not have a formal reply to read.

People will be shocked that the Minister is not here to respond to this Topical Issue matter, which was selected yesterday for discussion today.  I expected the Minister to be here.  Not only is he not here, he has not afforded the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, the courtesy of giving him a script to read on his behalf.  Shame on the Minister, Deputy Harris, for treating the Oireachtas Members of County Laois in such a manner.  I do not have an ego, but I represent 85,000 people who live in County Laois and the surrounding counties.  I have never encountered this treatment before.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 40,000 people visit the accident and emergency department each year.  On 17 April 2018, in a written reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister said that he would engage in a consultation process with local GPs.  In September 2018, well over a year ago, he told me that the process for that consultation had been agreed and an external facilitator was to be appointed.  That has not happened.  Nothing the Minister has said to date has happened.  I note the Minister of State is being provided with a script.  If it is related to this matter, it is welcome, belatedly.<\/p>  <p>  My opening statement on this Topical Issue matter is verbatim my opening statement on a Topical Issue Matter on this issue on 19 April 2018, which means I have been raising this issue for 20 months and the Minister has done nothing but add to the uncertainty by not resolving the issue.  This uncertainty is damaging the hospital and public confidence in it.  It is also preventing staff taking up positions in the hospital.  I reiterate my invitation to the Minister to visit Portlaoise hospital and to confirm that the accident and emergency department there will continue in operation.  If the Minister was even to contemplate scaling down services, he would be adding to the already overcrowded accident and emergency departments in neighbouring counties in terms of trolley numbers and queues.  The other hospitals could not possibly cater for additional people.  The Minister needs to confirm that the services currently provided in Portlaoise hospital will continue to be provided, following which we can focus on the development of services into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400029#HH00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1575471000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I would like to clarify that there was no intention to insult the Deputy or degrade the issue.  It was human error that I was given a response to a different Topical Issue matter.  I now have the correct script, which, with the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will read.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Fleming for raising this matter.  I would like to reassure him that, as stated previously by the Minister, Deputy Harris, the most important issue in regard to the consideration of services at the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise is that patient safety and outcomes come first.  The Minister has committed to securing and further developing the role of the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands hospital group.<\/p>  <p>  Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure that services that are not sustainable are discontinued and that sustainable services are safely assured and adequately resourced.  Funding has increased by 42% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 31% from the 2014 base.  Governance and management arrangements in Portlaoise hospital have been strengthened, additional clinical staff have been appointed and staff training, hospital culture and communications have improved.  The Dublin Midlands hospital group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise hospital that takes account of the need to develop services at Portlaoise in the context of developing a model of service provision for the entire hospital group.  The draft plan has been submitted to the Department of Health.  I would like to emphasise again that patient and public requirements are paramount and have underpinned the Department's consideration of the draft plan.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE group involved in the development of the draft action plan for Portlaoise hospital included eight national clinical programmes, the National Ambulance Service and the HSE national acute hospitals division.  This group focused on the risk issues and the interdependencies of the various clinical services across the emergency department, general surgery, general medicine, general paediatrics, obstetrics, gynaecology and neonatology.  The HSE consultations took place with the clinical staff and management in Portlaoise general practitioners, the Irish Prison Service, Tallaght Hospital, paediatric surgery and emergency department services, and the master of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  As the Minister outlined previously, no decision has been made on the draft action plan for Portlaoise hospital.  He has committed to ensuring that local clinicians and the community will be consulted before a decision is made, and he has decided that a comprehensive consultation exercise should be undertaken by the HSE with an external facilitator and involving the key stakeholder groups in Portlaoise hospital.  The consultation will involve key stakeholders and local community representatives and provide an opportunity to listen to and address the issues and concerns that stakeholders have highlighted.  The consultation will also provide an opportunity to set out the immediate priorities for service development and improvement in the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400029#HH00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2019: Message from Select Committee","time":1575471000,"counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400029#HH00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1575471000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Health has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for public services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2019: Vote 38 - Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400029#HH00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Environmental Impact of Quarries and Incinerators: Motion [Private Members]","time":1575471000,"counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400029#HH00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1575471000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>recognises: <br \/><br \/>&mdash;

and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure that plans for residual waste, left over after recycling or re-use, are prepared on the basis that the levels of such will be progressively reduced. <\/blockquote>  <p>There was a time when incineration was seen as the perfect antidote or alternative to landfill when it came to the disposal of toxic waste.  However, those days are long since passed.  Public opinion has moved on and science has moved on.  The arguments put forward in favour of incineration have been shown by numerous studies and reports to be both self-serving and simplistic.  I could give examples but time does not permit me to do so.  Incineration is not a very efficient way to produce energy.  Three to four times more energy can be saved by a combination of reusing, recycling and composting.  Trash cannot be regarded as a renewable resource and incineration cannot be seen as sustainable technology, because when something is burned, we have to go all the way back to square one and extract more virgin resources to replace it.<\/p><p>Another effect of incineration, as evidenced from studies of what has happened in various countries that have built large numbers of incinerators, is that the focus of policymakers shifts from how to dispose of waste to how to keep the incinerator operating.  The net result of this, as we anticipate in Limerick, is that we would have to import other people's waste.  In other words, we will be moving from landfill to incineration but we will be burning not only our own waste but other people's waste.  As stated by Dr. Ludwig Kr&auml;mer, former waste director for the European Union:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAn incinerator needs to be fed for twenty to thirty years, and in order to be economic it needs an enormous input.  So, for twenty to thirty years you stifle innovation, you stifle alternatives, just in order to feed that monster which you have built. <\/blockquote>  <p>Even if incineration could be made safe, it could never be made sensible.  It does not make ethical or economic sense to spend so much time, money and effort destroying materials that we should be sharing with the future.  Professor Paul Connett gave evidence on behalf of an organisation in Limerick called Limerick Against Pollution during the recent An Bord Plean&aacute;la oral hearing.<\/p> <p>He is a retired professor of environmental chemistry in St. Lawrence University in New York.  He wrote a book on how we should proceed titled <i>The Zero Waste Solution: Untrashing the Planet One Community at a Time.  <\/i>I recommend it to every single member of the Cabinet and certainly to every member of the next Cabinet.  It shows how in places such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy and individual provinces in Canada such as Ontario and Nova Scotia, not only the state but cities, communities and individual corporations have tackled the problem of waste through composting and recycling.  <br\/><br\/>There is increasing public resistance to incineration.  A vote in the European Parliament supports the notion that no material can be burned in incineration if it can be recycled or composted.  This amounts to more than 90% of waste, which would virtually rule out the building of new incinerators in Europe and force the closure of several existing ones.  In the United States, not one new trash incinerator has been allowed for the past 25 years, since 1995.  In that period, 300 proposals have been put forward for such incinerators and all have been rejected.<br\/><br\/>Incineration has a devastating impact on public health.  Incinerators generate a toxic ash which is poorly handled, toxic air emissions which are poorly monitored and nanoparticles which are not effectively captured by air pollution control devices, travel incredibly long distances and penetrate deep into the lungs.  As a direct result of the State's policy on incineration, we have a very serious issue in my constituency.  A licence for incinerating waste was granted to Cement Roadstone Holdings Limited for its plant at Templemungret in Limerick, right in the middle of a population of approximately 25,000 people in the southern suburbs of Limerick city.  The company sought and secured planning permission from Limerick City and County Council.  The decision went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which held an oral hearing lasting about ten days that many of us attended.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la approved the planning permission.  The company then applied to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for a licence and despite receiving 4,500 objections, the EPA granted it nevertheless.  Is the Minister aware of a single instance where planning permission was granted for a plant such as this and the EPA subsequently decided not to grant the licence?  In my view, the EPA slavishly follows the planning authority and automatically grants the licence.  That approach is completely bonkers.  The planning authority deals with planning issues such as traffic, whereas the EPA is supposed to protect the environment.<br\/><br\/>The irony of the EPA's decision was well summed up in a letter to the <i>Limerick Leader<\/i>last September by Dr. Angus Mitchell, a leading member of Limerick Against Pollution, who wrote that it was a devastating moment filled with cruel irony.  Last week, he continued, as the Government declared a climate and biodiversity emergency, some 4,500 citizens of Limerick who had lodged complaints against the proposed plan by Irish Cement to incinerate vast amounts of toxic waste in their midst were notified by a cold formal email that their pleas had fallen on deaf ears.  This is a natural consequence of the Government's waste management policy.  In a further irony, this licence is being granted to a company that has been polluting the environment in my region for decades.  I recently turned up a case from 1940, almost 80 years ago, where a number of local people took a case against Irish Cement Limited for polluting the environment.  Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy remarked that there was no excuse for the indifference to people's rights demonstrated by Irish Cement Limited.  He found there was a public nuisance in this case and granted damages.  Unfortunately, things have not improved much since 1940; in fact, they have disimproved.<br\/><br\/>Time and again, Irish Cement Limited has been convicted before the courts of this country for violating its limited licence requirements.  It has been convicted for polluting the environment but the fines are risible.  According to Davy Stockbrokers, Cement Roadstone Holdings is projected to make a profit of &euro;4.23 billion, an increase from &euro;3.37 billion last year, yet the largest fine imposed on the company as a result of its pollution of the environment in Limerick has been &euro;4,000.  What is the significance of a fine of &euro;4,000 to a company of that magnitude?  It is now proposed to give Cement Roadstone permission to burn 90,000 tonnes of toxic waste annually.  That is the initial permit but the figure will rise dramatically, as was the case in Drogheda.  Incredibly, there is no system for collecting data on the implications of this incinerator for public health.  In 1998, a report on the alleged consequences of pollution from the Aughinish Alumina plant in Askeaton recommended that such a system be put in place.  However, 21 years later no such system has been put in place.<br\/><br\/>As I said, the Environmental Protection Agency tends to slavishly follow the decision of the local authority.  Its attitude in this regard, to cite Dr. Mitchell again, belongs to another era of business, an era that itself should be extinct rather than propelling the planet towards extinction.  When the EPA makes a decision it is possible to appeal but that appeal will be to the EPA.  That it is akin to someone convicted of a crime by the district judge in Limerick being told he or she can appeal the conviction to the same district justice.  What happened to the constitutional principle, one that has been repeatedly accepted by the Supreme Court, <i>nemo judex in sua causa, <\/i>or nobody should be a judge in their own cause?<br\/><br\/>It is amazing that in 2019, the EPA cannot, by law, be held accountable for any of its decisions.  The legislation establishing the EPA made it immune from suit, in other words, it prevented it by statute from being sued.  I tried to move a Bill in the House recently to end that immunity.  I was ruled out of order by yet another Government misuse of the money message mechanism.  In 2010, a report on the EPA was commissioned by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley.  One of the report's strongest recommendations was that this immunity should be ceased forthwith.  It pointed out that the statutory immunity enjoyed by the EPA was problematic from the point of view of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Although the Government ruled my legislation out on the basis of a money message, it could have easily brought forward its own legislation, as I had done extensive research on the matter, but it chose not to do so.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State is not a member of the Fine Gael Party but he should note that all parties and none in the Limerick area have vehemently opposed this proposal.  They have done so publicly and privately and have spoken against it at public meetings.  I have tabled this motion in an effort to halt this process and, at a minimum, delay, but hopefully avert, the calamity which faces the people of my city.  It will be very interesting to see the Government's attitude.  If the Fine Gael Party takes a different view in here from its representatives on the ground in Limerick, who are promising to go to the stake on behalf of the people, what would that say about them?  I look forward to the Minister of State's response with eager anticipation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400029#HH00700","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575471600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Today's debate centres around two instances where private companies are seen to damage or potentially damage the environment and it appears that nothing can be done about it.  These are only two cases in a wider trend whereby the Government is not willing to tackle the activities of some companies.  These are not isolated cases.  For example, almost 1,200 people a year are dying as a result of air pollution, yet the Government will still not introduce a nationwide ban on smoky coal.  The EPA wants such a ban, the Government claims it wants it, and even some Irish coal producers want it but it is not happening because the Government is afraid of legal threats from outside the State.  That is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Unpublished research by the HSE and EPA has warned that where poor air quality is recorded, it has an affect on cardiac arrhythmia and asthma and causes a deterioration in COPD and related illnesses.  Despite these findings, this trend continues.  The issue of unregulated quarries which the motion seeks to address is much the same.  Despite enforcement actions by local authorities and An Taisce, legal actions and convictions, some unauthorised quarry operators have continued blasting and extraction.  They appear to be able to act as a law unto themselves, even in special areas of conservation.<\/p> <p>We need to understand, before even more of our habitat is destroyed, why the mechanisms in place to block these operations are not working.<\/p> <p> As a party we have put forward several constructive proposals to deal with the small number of commercial operators working in an environmentally damaging manner.  These measures include strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency and reviewing the mechanism by which so many illegal quarries have been able to continue to operate with impunity, as well as encouraging the reduction of waste.  The Government has shown itself on a number of occasions to be afraid of tackling companies engaged in environmentally harmful activities.  As I said, along with these matters, a nationwide ban on smoky coal has been stalled because of an apparent legal threat.  Instead of real action, the Government has put forward unworkable proposals around many issues and it is not seeking to address the core problem with smoky coal.<\/p> <p> One in eight quarries across Ireland operates without planning approval according to a recent survey by RT&Eacute;.  It found the quarries are able to challenge the system of regulation through constant appeals and judicial review applications to the High Court while continuing to profit from illegal activities.  Despite the actions of others, including environmental groups, the enforcement regime is not working and there is a hands-off approach from the Government.  Due to the length of time it takes to go through the process, these operations will continue to extract material, expand their work and blast the countryside without permission.  It has also emerged that some councils are also customers of these quarries, which is a total contradiction and a worrying development when it comes to enforcement.  There is an example in the Minister of State's county.  An urgent review is required, particularly with quarrying operations in special areas of conservation.<\/p> <p> This simply would not be allowed in other industries.  A restaurant could not continue to operate in these circumstances but we allow people to carry out blasting nonetheless.  It is absolute madness and there seem to be different rules for some businesses over individuals.  We are entering a period of significant change as we seek to meet climate change and biodiversity commitments.  It is undeniable that many people will have to change their behaviour.  Some will face job losses and retraining, as we have seen in the midlands, and businesses will have to change to focus their activities on something more sustainable.  Others will refit and improve homes.  We know this process must work, because if it does not, there is no alternative.  We cannot allow some of these businesses to continue their operations with total impunity and disregard for the State.  The fact that local authorities and enforcement procedures are being ignored is simply unacceptable.  The message is loud and clear that tackling this challenge is for some and not for all.  If that message is allowed to fester, it will lead to more division and delay, and it could ultimately lead to a failure to deliver on our 2030 and 2050 climate targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400030#JJ00200","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575472200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, on bringing forward this motion with other colleagues.  Some points have already been made but I will make a general point.  Along with the Minister of State, we are all familiar with the fact that in recent years there has been much talk about the need for the Government and individual citizens to make changes to assist Ireland in delivering its climate action obligations.  We see efforts made at an individual and household level as well as at a community, national and international level.  Both individuals and large corporations are adopting new policies and strategies so they can make their contribution in reducing their carbon footprint while diversifying and innovating into other materials.  This enables people to carry on doing what they have done but in an environmentally sensitive way.<\/p>  <p>  Concrete and cement form a very interesting topic to some.  There was a very interesting article recently in one of the United Kingdom newspapers about cement, which is the second most used substance in the world after water.  It is highly carbon intensive.  Every three years since 2003 China has used more cement than the United States did in the entire 20th century.  This is an incredibly carbon-rich compound.<\/p>  <p>  There have been a few examples in the media recently of companies that have traditionally been in a heavily carbonised industry.  Tyre manufacturers are an example.  We know that locally and nationally there are issues, specifically on bonfire night, with the burning or illegal dumping of tyres.  One of the market leaders in the manufacturing of tyres has established a leasing system whereby a person does not buy tyres.  A person leases them from a company, and when they reach end of life, they can be returned to the company.  There is a contract and this ensures the tyres can either be remoulded or recycled but they are certainly not dumped and they do not end up in the ocean.  If that company, Michelin, is capable of doing such things in a toxic industry, other companies should be able to do it too.  I heard on the radio this morning that Kingspan, one of our great companies, is hoping to recycle a billion plastic bottles and turn the particles from them into insulation material so that our homes, in the not too distant future could be insulated by completely recycled material that would otherwise go into the ground.<\/p>  <p>  What is the connection between those companies and cement?  If companies are able to make a shift in what they do and can still carry on the business they are in, innovations in earthworks, cement and quarrying must be considered as well.  As Deputies O'Dea and Jack Chambers have said, some companies can carry on their business in a legitimate way and we hope to make progress with them and help them innovate with some of their products.  If others are sticking up their fingers to the Government, wider officialdom and the legal system in carrying out their works without any regard to the law and, more important, the country's climate action obligations, this must be dealt with through the full force of the law, as Deputy O'Dea noted.<\/p>  <p>  It is very hard for people to figure out how this happens.  Most of us know of quarries at some location in our constituencies and there are one or two in the rural part of mine.  How these can be missed from an enforcement or legal perspective is beyond me.  This motion is setting its face against the illegal quarrying work that is going on and it is stressing the environmental impact of these quarries and incinerators.  It is putting it up to the Government to formulate a policy once and for all to ensure that national regulatory agencies get whatever powers they need.  There must be enforcement.  The idea that a company can have a soft route through judicial review or appeal and escape the hands of the law with impunity must end once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400031#KK00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1575472200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I wish to address the environmental aspects of the Private Members' motion.  My colleague, the Minister of State in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, will deal with the planning and quarrying related aspects of the motion later.<\/p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency undertakes a range of regulatory tasks relating to the licensing, permitting, consenting or certification of activities that could have an impact on the environment or on human health.  The agency is the competent authority for granting and enforcing industrial and waste licences, and it undertakes an annual programme of audits and inspections of agency-licensed facilities.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is constrained by the provisions of sections 79(3) and 86(5) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, as amended, from becoming involved in any way with the licensing of installations under the Act.  On the matters raised relating to the licensing of Irish Cement, therefore, it is not appropriate for the Minister to comment or interfere in any way.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to amend section 15 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 with respect to the immunity of the agency.  My Department is not satisfied that a basis exists to support a proposal for amendment having regard, in particular, to the potential implications for the effective discharge by the agency of its statutory functions and the potential impact of such a precedent on the effective operation of other State bodies that have a similar form of immunity.<\/p>  <p>  Public participation is central to the work undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency in determining licence applications.  The agency has a clear process in place to ensure the public is aware of a licence application and can participate in the decision-making process at the various stages.<\/p> <p>On the agency's website, each installation has a homepage from where key information can be viewed, such as the licence application, licence details, correspondence regarding the licence application and inspection and other enforcement reports.  The European Environmental Bureau, the largest network of environmental citizens' organisations in Europe, examined how effectively European countries are making available to the public information about industrial pollution and identified the agency's website as best practice.<\/p> <p> The agency will grant a licence only when it is satisfied the emissions from the installation when operated in accordance with the conditions of the proposed licence will meet all required environmental protection standards, will not endanger human health or harm the environment in the vicinity of the installation or over a wider area.  In arriving at a determination on a licence, the EPA ensures there is planning permission in place before it can grant a licence to the activity where an environmental impact assessment is required.  Section 97 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act provides the agency with the power to revoke, or suspend the operation of, a licence or revised licence if it appears to the agency that the licensee no longer satisfies certain requirements set out in the Act as regards being a fit and proper person.  In arriving at a decision to revoke, the agency will also have regard to the seriousness of the matter.  The agency licensing process allows for submissions and objections to be made outside of the courts, including requests for oral hearings.<\/p> <p> Regarding enforcement, the agency adopts a risk based approach towards enforcement and considers and uses a range of enforcement tools, including issuing non-compliances to formal enforcement processes such as prosecutions.  The agency recently published its enforcement policy which sets out the wide range of enforcement powers, including statutory enforcement powers available to the EPA.  This document sets out the policy the EPA applies when enforcing environmental and radiological protection legislation.  It aims to promote a shared understanding of the principles and criteria underpinning enforcement decisions.<\/p> <p> Since 2017, the EPA launched a new enforcement initiative to drive further environmental compliance at industrial and waste facilities.  Licensed facilities with the poorest compliance status are identified on a national priority list for enforcement using a new system developed by the agency.  Points are allocated to each site based on compliance data such as complaints, incidents and non-compliances over the previous six months.  Sites which exceed a certain threshold become a national priority site and are targeted by the agency for further enforcement action.<\/p> <p> A review of the environment fund has been completed by my Department. Following this review, a three-phased series of environmental levies over the period 2020-25 is proposed, including a waste recovery levy.  The primary aim of the levies is to encourage positive environmental behavioural change and climate action.  It is intended that any resources generated will be ring-fenced to support additional environmental initiatives, infrastructure and actions that drive further positive change.<\/p> <p> I will now address the issues raised in the Private Members' motion relating to waste prevention, plastics and the circular economy.  Section 21A of the Waste Management Act gives legal effect to the waste hierarchy in this country.  This means that waste legislation and policy must prioritise the treatment of waste in the following order: prevention; prepare for reuse; recycle; recovery, including energy recovery; and, finally, disposal, which in practice means landfilling.  These priorities are reflected in our key strategic documents, namely, our national waste policy, A Resource Opportunity, the national waste prevention programme and the regional waste management plans.  However, the Government also recognises the urgent need to transform our approach to waste in line with modern, circular economy principles.  This will involve a mindset change from accepting waste as a fact of life to rejecting wastefulness in every shape and form.  The climate action plan has committed Government to delivering a new national policy that will lead the transformation from waste management to circular economy practice.  Building on the European Commission's circular economy action plan and the associated legislation, my Department has initiated this process.<\/p> <p> Following a targeted stakeholder conference that took place in September, my Department will launch a public consultation on a new waste policy before the end of this year.  The general public and all stakeholders will have an opportunity to shape and influence our future policy direction in this area.  Given the new higher legal targets we need to meet for recycling, it will be important to have comprehensive buy-in for the measures we need to take.<\/p> <p> We should also note that the incoming European Commission intends to introduce a more ambitious circular economy action plan in the coming weeks.  At a minimum, this is likely to further extend circular economy principles into the areas of construction waste and textiles.  By weight, construction waste accounts for half of the 15 million tonnes of waste generated in this country every year.  I have been already working with my officials and other partners to tackle this problem.  Our construction waste resource group provides a valuable platform to discuss and monitor construction waste, including the capacity of the sector to manage its waste.<\/p> <p> On plastics, the Government has committed to leading the way in reducing single use plastics.  To date, we have agreed that Departments and bodies will no longer purchase single use plastic cups, cutlery and straws; strongly supported new EU legislation which includes a ban on plastic straws and other discretionary single use plastic items; committed to a 90% plastic bottle collection target and a 55% plastic packaging recycling target; commenced a clean oceans initiative to combat marine litter; and introduced a new law to ban microbeads.<\/p> <p> A member raised the issue of tyres.  I want to put on the record that 97% of car tyres were recycled here in 2018.  That is as a result of innovation and rules brought in by the Government.<\/p> <p> I welcome the opportunity to set out the work which is being done to deal with the environmental issues raised in this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400031#KK00300","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575472800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in members have 15 minutes.

That approach has been fundamentally flawed.  We need to view waste as not something we need to get rid of in the cheapest far-off places.  We need to change our relationship with waste and see it as something that is of value and something that is a resource.  Only then, will we as a society have a desire to stop burning and burying it and to start reducing, reusing and recycling in more ways.  <\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is totally opposed to incineration.  It causes air pollution and the emission of toxic fumes.  There is also an increase in the volume of traffic generated by the transportation of waste to and from incinerators.  One other aspect of incineration is that after burning, the remaining ash, which is usually 20% to 30% of the mass of waste, still needs to be disposed of in landfill.  A further approximately 7%, known as fly ash, is classified as toxic waste which cannot be disposed of even in landfill and requires further treatment.  In addition, building an incinerator involves a large capital cost.  Once built, it must be used on a continuous basis, which will lock-in incineration as the primary method of disposal for generations to come.  <\/p><p>We warned against this when there were plans to build incinerators in Dublin ten years ago.  One got the go-ahead from a former Green Party Leader and the then Minister with responsibility for the environment, John Gormley.  Prior to leading his party into government with Fianna F&aacute;il, he campaigned against the proposed incinerator.  In fact, the Green Party Leader was one of the most vocal and prominent voices against the Government's incineration policy.  Yet, once in government with Fianna F&aacute;il, he oversaw the very same policy he once fought against.Today we are dealing with an issue of legislation about which the Green Party, despite having held the ministerial office with responsibility for the environment for four years, declined to do anything.  <\/p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency has too much power and there is not enough accountability.  Its ability to override the wishes of the ordinary people and the mandate of local politicians and local councillors cannot be allowed to stand.  At the same time, we need to change the model of waste that Fine Gael as well as Fianna F&aacute;il in government with the Green Party, so eagerly pursued.  We need to treat waste as a resource.  To do that, we need to take private profit out of it and that means taking it back into public ownership and control.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to putting waste collection back under the control of local authorities.  The current privatised system is expensive, bad for the environment, and severely lacking in controls and regulations.  We cannot have profit supersede the environment.  We are the only state in Europe with a completely privatised waste collection system and the only EU state persisting with side-by-side competition for waste collection.<\/p> <p> I was first elected as a councillor in 2004.  I am not sure when the Minister of State first entered politics.  There was a massive public campaign against privatising waste collection at the time.  When the Government first brought in bin charges, they were brought in at what was called a nominal value.  In Waterford it was initially &pound;40 a year.  We made the argument that, once a charge was brought in and the service became about profit, the charges would go up and up and that eventually the service would be privatised.  Fianna F&aacute;il said that was not the case and that this was not its intention.  Martin Cullen was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who championed this measure.  Throughout the process we were told that privatisation was not on the agenda and that costs would not increase.  That is what happened.  There is now no local authority in the country providing this service.<\/p> <p> We have ended up with multiple operators, in some places six or seven, passing each other out on different days.  They are going into housing estates to collect bins from different doors, creating more traffic congestion.  All the while, the cost for consumers and householders has increased.  The average cost for waste collection is now between &euro;300 and &euro;400 a year, depending on where in the country a person lives.  We are not rewarding people for recycling more, although people are doing so.  People are treating waste more as a resource, as I have said.  They use the green bin and the brown bin but, despite the fact that households are recycling more than ever before, they are paying more than ever. <\/p> <p> We also have multiple operators making profit, going in and out of housing estates, and doing what they do.  We are committed, in the first instance, to ending the practice of side-by-side competition.  We support the analysis carried out by Dublin City Council which suggests moving towards a franchise system.  This would be a stepping stone towards full public ownership of waste management services.  We need to do all of this to ensure that we do right by the environment and set the very highest standards in waste management policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400032#LL00300","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575473400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I wanted to speak on this motion as it is directly relevant to a very important issue in my constituency of Limerick city.  I was appalled when the Environmental Protection Agency awarded Irish Cement a licence to burn tyres and other rubbish at its factory in Mungret, Limerick.  This area is surrounded by homes, sports fields and other community facilities.  It is a rapidly growing area in which a great number of houses are under construction.  Local people, businesses, and public representatives do not want this.  People in Limerick are pretty unanimous in opposing it.  A massive rally was held which was attended by sportspeople, business people, politicians and community groups.  Everybody was involved in it.  It is not fair that one company can run roughshod over all of this legitimate opposition and proceed with a project that will have a massive impact on our community.  The air quality and local environment belong to everybody in Mungret and Limerick, not just to Irish Cement.  This was a toxic decision by the Environmental Protection Agency, whose purpose should be to protect people and our environment.  This incinerator will be accompanied by buildings in which to store rubbish waiting to be burned.  In addition to the emissions that will pollute our city and countryside, Mungret will become a dumping ground for waste from across the entire State and, possibly, from abroad.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said, there has been a massive campaign by people in Limerick and surrounding areas in opposition to this plan.  Thousands of people have been out protesting.  I would like the Minister of State to address this issue in his response.  He cannot simply wash his hands of this issue.  It is a very serious issue in Limerick and the disregard the Government has thus far shown to the local community in this regard will be remembered in the upcoming general election, whenever that takes place.  People are really frustrated, angry, and disappointed with this decision.  Nobody stood up for them and nobody stood by them.  Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to stand with the community and to call for this wrong and unjustified decision to be overturned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400033#MM00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1575473400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I will speak in favour of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  Illegal dumping is a scourge in many communities.  In my own constituency, illegal dumping has spiralled out of control.  Local residents are at their wits' end as they see rubbish appearing daily on their greens, in alleyways and beside public bins.  No one is held accountable.  Illegal operators act with near impunity and it is the local residents who suffer the sight of their green spaces being covered in domestic waste while their children have nowhere to play.<\/p>  <p>  The local Sinn F&eacute;in councillors and Dublin City Council staff are doing all they can in my area but they are fighting a losing battle.  There is an illegal dump in my constituency.  This dump, in Moatview, is a matter of concern.  I wrote to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, last year to request its assistance urgently in cleaning up this site as the council was struggling to contain this dump, where domestic and industrial waste had been disposed of.  The local garda&iacute; were unable to divert resources to assist in the stamping out of dumping because they were already too stretched in the area.  We need the Government to treat this issue seriously.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities across the State successfully managed waste collection for decades before it was privatised.  This has resulted in a race to the bottom.  We have seen an upsurge in illegal dumping and illegal landfill sites run by rogue operators.  Costs are increasing and dumping is getting worse.  Bringing waste collection back under council control is a straightforward and progressive solution that would have a significant impact on people and communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400033#MM00300","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1575473400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on a number of environmental issues that have had a significant impact on my constituency of Dublin North-West.  In Finglas, we had the famous Dunsink tip head, which was in operation for more than 30 years.  This was nearly ten years more than it had initially been licensed for.  After much campaigning and lobbying by me and the great Finglas environmentalist, Mr. Brendan O'Connell, the dump was eventually shut down.  This only happened after a long and arduous campaign that ultimately ended in us taking the case to Europe, having had little or no success through the EPA.  This was not necessarily the end of our problems, however.  The Dunsink tip head was capped, but the subsequent management of the closed site left a lot to be desired.  The leachate pool, which was designed to remove contaminants from the waste products in the dump, failed to operate properly on a number of occasions.  On one example, the leachate pool pump failed.  There was no backup pump in place and the pool overflowed, the contaminated water subsequently polluting the Tolka river leading to the deaths of thousands of fish and other aquatic life.  This is an example of the failure to manage correctly those facilities designed to protect the environment.  The destruction of this beautiful and popular amenity was an act of environmental vandalism.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that greatly affects the people of my constituency is the privatisation of bin services.  Our amendments to this motion seek for bin services to be returned to the local authorities and to be taken out of private hands.  As a consequence of the privatisation of bin services, illegal dumping has become an increasing scourge in our local areas as well as a threat to health.  Dublin City Council has to spend millions of euros every year to clean up our communities and to remove dumped waste of every description.  This money could have been spent more productively elsewhere.  Not only do private individuals pay for this service, but Dublin City Council also spends money on the issue, which is absolutely mad.<\/p>  <p>  A number of houses and apartments built during the regeneration of Ballymun were affected by pyrite, which caused major structural damage requiring significant and costly repairs.<\/p>  <p>This was repeated throughout the country, particularly in Louth, Ashbourne, Balbriggan, Finglas and Ballymun.  It was the result of poor monitoring and management of quarries.  People moving into new homes later found to have pyrite were left for years in despair and misery as a result of this major failure.  Proper measures to manage and protect our environment and its resources are vital if we are serious about addressing these concerns.<\/p> <p> Another issue I find very infuriating is that relating to bottle banks.  Bottles are placed in separate containers depending on whether they are clear, brown or any other colour.  Lo and behold, when the truck arrives, the glass is all emptied into the same container irrespective of how it has been segregated.  This is infuriating.  The Minister should find out the reasons for this practice.  What is the point in telling people to separate their bottles and then dumping them all into the same container?  It does not make any sense.  The Minister should look into the matter and tackle the local authorities in respect of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400033#MM00400","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575474000,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I want to speak very briefly about complaints from residents in the Mungret and Raheen areas of Limerick regarding dust deposition and Irish Cement's proposals to burn tyres and various other materials at the cement factory in Mungret.  As previous speakers from the Limerick area stated, this is a cause of real concern.  There have been public meetings, marches, etc., and several serious objections to the proposals have been raised.  I welcome this motion and I would like to support the other Limerick Deputies who have spoken on it.  Across party lines, we all wish to express our concerns, particularly about the lack of confidence that the terms of this licence will be properly monitored if it is granted.  The effects of such a development on health and on air quality are unknowable.  This is a cause of serious concern to people in the immediate area and, because of the prevailing winds and effects on the atmosphere, the wider region.  The motion speaks for itself.  Obviously, it deals with other issues relating to quarries and so on.  I wish to place on record the fact that  have very serious concerns about this issue.  We have not been given proper assurances that if this goes ahead it will be properly monitored through an independent monitoring system that will satisfy people that the air is not being polluted.  In the past, people in the area have found dust on their cars and around their homes.  Several new schools, housing developments and a playground where young children spend a great deal of time have been built in the area, which is quite heavily populated.  This adds to the concern about the possible serious detrimental effects of this development.<\/p>  <p>  As already stated, I will not address the other issues but I know that there is concern regarding unlicensed quarries operating in various parts of the country.  We all share the concern about illegal dumping, which can be seen throughout the countryside.  In some cases, people go to extraordinary lengths to dump household rubbish in really beautiful places that are quite out of the way.  It can be very difficult for the authorities to actually bring prosecutions in respect of this type of behaviour.  I reported one case myself.  I was climbing a hill in a neighbouring county and encountered rubbish dumped in this manner.  We were able to get evidence and send it to the local authority, which did prosecute those responsible.  That is very welcome.  However it can be very difficult for local authorities to actually pursue culprits.  Some people make extraordinary efforts to dump their rubbish in beautiful and out-of-the-way places.  One would hope this mindset had been eliminated from this country but unfortunately it has not.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be vigilant and ensure that we have appropriate strong safeguards and penalties for people found guilty of this type of activity.

However it reflects wider concerns.  These concerns involve two questions.  Firstly, do we value the environment?  Secondly, if we do, how do we go about protecting it?  There are doubts about how much we value the environment.  The issues at the core of this motion are just two aspects of a much wider debate.  No one is blameless.  Every Government in recent history has made disastrous decisions about the environment and ignored the right course of action.  That also applies to many communities in Ireland.  However, it is easy to pass the buck and say that the fault lies elsewhere.<\/p><p>I find it ironic that permission is being given for tyres to be burned by an Irish Cement plant in Castlemungret when every Hallowe'en there is a major problem in certain areas of Dublin with young people acquiring tyres for bonfires.  Garda&iacute;, community and youth leaders and teachers are all on the same wavelength in trying to dissuade young people from burning tyres.  At the same time many young people are highlighting climate change.  The Private Members' motion takes notice of the claim that the temperature at which tyres are burned means there will not be a significant impact on the environment.  However, impact is impact, regardless of whether it is significant or not.<\/p><p>The motion also refers to complaints lodged by nearby residents about dust deposition.  I know the effects of the burning of tyres at bonfires on communities in Dublin, not to mention the very costly clean-up required afterwards.  I note that Irish Cement has faced fines for breaches, but a maximum fine of &euro;4,000 is not going to make a difference to a company like Irish Cement.  We have implementation with a small &quot;i&quot;.  The same can be said about the unauthorised quarries.  According to the motion, it seems that enforcement notices issued by the local authorities were not effective.  I wish to place those two issues, the burning of tyres and quarries, into the bigger picture of how we value our environment.<\/p><p>We know that global emissions are rising.  There is more and more evidence of climate breakdown.  The climate emergency is not in the distant future; it is affecting us now.  There is a need for balance between going green and achieving a just transition for the affected communities.  We must not exacerbate the poverty faced by certain groups.  I want to acknowledge the work of Dr. Lorna Gold, who has produced very balanced, thoughtful and insightful speeches and articles on this, particularly addressing the need for balance.  Green policies and social policies need to be complementary.  Too often they are pushed into battle with each other.  In one of her articles she writes, &quot;Good eco-social policies are about a win-win of addressing inequality <i>and <\/i>emissions&quot;.  She goes on to note that a just transition requires progressive welfare systems, social insurance and good social services.  Practical measures include retrofitting of public housing for those on low incomes and good public infrastructure.  We have examples of that already.  Dr. Gold also calls for supports for those communities displaced by the transition to low-carbon sectors.  There is a real need for forward planning, which is very difficult in political life.  Nobody knows how long they are going to be here.  That is why there is a need for consensus among all Members, regardless of which party or grouping is in power.  This is not just a decision for whichever group or party is in power; it is a decision for all of us.<\/p><p>That leads me on to another aspect of the motion, namely, the need for greater public awareness, engagement and participation.  Dr. Gold has noted that we need to identify the bigger polluters and support the principle that the polluter pays.<\/p> <p>One of the proposals from the Youth Assembly is for a staggered corporation tax linked to emissions.<\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 7 from the Youth Assembly is that Ireland would outlaw acts of ecocide, which is the widespread and systematic loss of ecosystems, including climate and cultural damage.  This covers a multitude but we know how long it takes to bring in legislation, so we need to start the process now.  The overall question is, of course, what will happen to the recommendations from the Youth Assembly.<\/p> <p> There is an interesting recommendation on labelling on packaging with regard to distance travelled, which could be difficult to implement.  What the assembly is trying to do is invaluable in this regard.  It brings up the issue of online shopping because it involves a lot of packaging, which could be avoided if the customer was to go to into a real shop and bring his or her own bag.  With online shopping there is a lot of travelling on the purchases.<\/p> <p> Youth Assembly recommendation No. 9 is a targeted nationwide information campaign to educate the population about the climate crisis, its causes, effects and solutions.  The two issues we are discussing today are included in that with aspects of the Fianna F&aacute;il's Private Members' motion and the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  The motion calls on the Government to prioritise prevention and recycling of waste over incineration, and to implement a community-led zero waste policy.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment calls for an increase in the number of recycling centres and the range of items accepted, which comes back to the students' recommendation for a nationwide information and education campaign.  This is vital because how can we recycle or work towards zero waste when there is a lot of ignorance and misinformation, and a lack of information, on recycling such as what exactly can be recycled and what we have to do with many items to make them recyclable.<\/p> <p> I attended an event recently where a restaurateur spoke about the difficulty she faces in the restaurant when it comes to recycling.  This is a person who is totally committed to recycling and climate issues.  She said that to recycle a specific item, there were a number of steps she had to go through, some of which negated the effect of recycling the item.  We need detailed and accurate information in a way that is readable, accessible and manageable.  How many recycle bins are contaminated because of the lack of real information?  Similarly, we need to know exactly what is supposed to go into compost bins.<\/p> <p> I find more knowledge and awareness among schoolchildren, especially in the schools with a green flag.  Those schools cover issues such as litter, waste, global citizenship, energy, water and biodiversity.  We see children telling the adults what they are supposed to be doing in this regard.<\/p> <p> Turning to the Houses of the Oireachtas and our efforts on waste, I have a particular gripe about the bins, which I have raised previously.  I guarantee that we would find the same items in all of the bins in the Oireachtas.  I may exaggerate slightly but I believe it is true because I do look at them.  We need an awareness campaign in Leinster House and in LH2000.  I cannot speak about Agriculture House or the Engineering Block because I am not there.  We need bins for cans and for paper, and we need to know exactly what is recyclable.  What happens to food waste here?  There is also a question to be asked around energy and we could take the Bundestag in Berlin as an example.  The idea of an independent regulator is also worth studying because I have questions around what happens to waste.  Deputy Ellis referred to bottles and I would also query what exactly happens to the waste when the various bins are collected.<\/p> <p> It is all very well using the bins, but we need guarantees that the next steps are also environmentally friendly and do not undermine the green agenda.  The students also recommended that the subject of sustainability be made compulsory to junior certificate.  Many of us were delighted to see history put back in its rightful place.  We could make the same points about geography.  Sustainability and climate could be included in that subject.<\/p> <p> Regardless of Ireland not meeting its emissions targets the biggest polluters are the United States of America and China.  While we can do our best, they need to be much more proactive than they currently are.<\/p> <p> Dr. Lorna Gold's paper is called Is Ireland ready for a Green New Deal?  We have to be ready and we need to move on to that page also.  Dr. Gold referred to issues of power, privilege and prestige at play.  This is the reality of the Private Members' motion.  While this debate is very welcome, it must be part of the wider debate on waste and climate in the context of a green deal.  We cannot go at this piecemeal or issue by issue.  There must be an overall plan to tackle the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400034#NN00300","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575474600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  Ireland's reliance on exporting waste cannot continue.

I would like to see stricter guidelines on the construction of wind farms and better dialogue with local communities where such facilities are built.  Planning guidelines are needed for solar farms.  Currently there are none.  The Government's policy creates a vacuum and developers take advantage of the situation by pushing through poorly thought out applications without consideration for the environment or rural communities.  This has happened recently near Bandon and Kinsale.  We must listen to the concerns of the people we represent.  This is not being done by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency I have seen how the Government does not take local concerns into account with regard to protecting the environment.  In the past 12 months in Skibbereen the people had to go all the way to the High Court to stop the building of a plastics factory.  In the Bantry area, after kelp farming was given the go-ahead without local consultation and proper investigation into the environmental impact, the people had to go to the High Court to put a stop to it.  Both cases were successful, but at great expense and time to local volunteers who are trying their best to save the environment.<\/p>  <p>  I proposed to the Taoiseach a park-and-ride scheme in west Cork from Clonakilty.  He seemed to be encouraged by this and we thought he was thinking along the same lines on it, but there was inaction from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  When I went to the office of the Minister, Deputy Ross, I got the usual thing, and we all know what happens in there.  We have constant congestion in areas like Bandon, Innishannon, Clonakilty, Dunmanway and right through west Cork because of the Minister's blatant disregard for west Cork.  A private company is now taking the initiative in providing an affordable private transport alternative that will take thousands of cars off our roads annually and improve people's quality of life and the air we breathe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400035#OO00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1575474600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I, too, support the motion by Deputy O'Dea.

None of them is here this evening to listen to the people's complaints and concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Some 5,000 objections were lodged with the EPA on this issue.  Not five, not 50, not 500.  It was 5,000.  A fine of &euro;4,000 is not enough.  The objections were all ignored blatantly.  It is like rubbing a fat sow's behind as they thicken their egos.  This was debated in this House and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government at the time, Deputy Kelly, my erstwhile colleague from Tipperary, did nothing about it.  There are also question marks about the ownership of this company and the connections that some Members of the House may have to it.  This stinks to high heaven and not only because of the smell of the tyres.  The whole reason for it stinks.  I support the small and struggling businesses who are trying every day.

Big is not necessarily wonderful.  How many times are we going to have to learn this in this country?<\/p>  <p>  We struggle, and we squeeze the small people.  The Government wants to get rid of the bingo cards too when some people just want to play bingo. This is not like the big gamblers who go to the Galway tent.  I do not know if the Minister of State was ever in that tent, but I was not and I do not want to be in it either.  It appears that the ordinary people do not matter.  It is a case of to hell or to Connacht with them.  Take every piece of decency they have and take every social outlet they have and make them pay up or shut up.

It has left a trail of devastation all over the world - in America, for a family in Wexford, everywhere.  It is too big to be taught.

When it comes to small people, though, it is a case of to hell or to Connacht like dirt on the soles of their shoes.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> There are too many issues, for example, the 5,000 complaints.  That is unbelievable.  This is dangerous.  We have changed legislation to allow the EPA and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to issue planning permission that moves away from the objectives, which is dangerous, and this is an example of that.

I have concerns over the continued exportation of waste, but when it comes to providing alternative policies, we must be careful and prudent in terms of their impact on local communities.  I thank the people of my local authority of Kerry County Council who provided a waste collection service for years.  I also thank them for their management of transfer stations once our local authority got out of the service.  I compliment the private operators.  In County Kerry, we have companies like KWD Recycling, Higgins Waste &amp;amp; Recycling Services, Dillon Waste &amp;amp; Recycling and so on.  In making the collection of waste and recycling of recyclables their business, they are creating employment and dealing with our waste in the best way they can, a way that is proper and diligent and meets all EPA guidelines.  I thank them for their work.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's legs are on the ground where this matter is concerned.  I thank and acknowledge the people who go out at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.  I often meet them when they are starting their day's work driving a lorry and collecting our waste around the country.  I thank those in County Kerry and throughout the rest of the country.  They are the people who collect the waste and go into housing estates.  They do it at that hour of the morning in the interests of safety.  They want to drive their lorries into areas and have the waste collected when there are no children around, no youngsters on bicycles, no one stepping out from behind a car and before anyone else is up.  For that, we must give them our humble thanks.  Only for them, the collection of waste would be much more hazardous.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, on his remarks about the warmer homes scheme and cutting carbon emissions.  I have people in County Kerry who want to avail of the warmer homes scheme, but they cannot do so because it is oversubscribed.  Will the Government be serious about providing funding to allow people to make their homes warmer and cut back on the amount of fuel they need?  All of the compliance suggestions being made cost money.  People need assistance in the form of grant aid.  If the Government has a greener homes scheme, it should make sure to fund it properly and give money to those who need it to make their homes more efficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400036#PP00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1575475200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Dooley, who is sharing time with Deputy O'Loughlin.

I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, for tabling this motion.  He and I operate in side by side constituencies and we are equally disturbed by the proposals to put an incinerator in place that will impact negatively on the livelihoods of people in the region.  We do not believe it is acceptable to our communities.  Nor is it right from an environmental perspective.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Dea and others have identified, the management of waste and the thinking around same have changed significantly in recent years.  We are in a circular economy where we need to reduce the amount of waste that is coming into the overall waste management system.  When new infrastructure is built, vast amounts of money are invested and that company and society are effectively locked into the processing of waste in what is now recognised as an outmoded system of waste management.  What is really needed is more forward thinking waste management, for example, better use of the recycling process or better composting procedures.  That requires education, Government policy and Government thinking.  Unless we put all of that in place, we are not going to have a better approach to the management of our waste or environment.  It is essential that the process under discussion be stopped.  Government policy must give that direction.<\/p>  <p>  Many in the House objected to the continuation of drilling for oil off the western seaboard.  It took the Taoiseach in a panic at a UN meeting in the US to capitulate when the pressure came on from international concerns and NGOs.  He did not listen to what was happening in the House.  It might take the Taoiseach being out of the country and in the company of others for the light to dawn on him in respect of this issue.  The sooner the Government comes to the realisation that locking ourselves into an investment in infrastructure that is past its sell-by date and no longer fit for purpose for residential communities across the State, the better.  It would ensure that we did not have a continued diminution of people's quality of life in the area.  Indeed, this is not just about them.  As Deputy O'Dea and others have identified, the particles go high into the atmosphere.  With the passage of time and rainfall in other regions, others must sustain the negative impacts on their health as well.  We need to address this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to speak to the part of the motion that deals with quarrying.  An interesting \"Prime Time\" programme the other night focused on unregulated quarries and local authorities' inability to deal with them.  In some cases, local authorities were even contracting with them and purchasing aggregate from them.  That is wrong and should not happen.  What is happening not only damages the environment, but also the genuine, hard-working quarry owners who work and live by the standards, which are rightly difficult to meet.  McGrath Quarries in my area meets all of the standards and works with local communities because it recognises that quarrying by its nature is not necessarily an easy business to conduct alongside where people live.  McGrath Quarries does a hell of a good job.  It works with the communities, tries to minimise the impact and lives by the standards.  Why should it be disenfranchised because other quarries are effectively operating lawlessly?  In Donegal, a quarry owner was dredging the riverbed and had the audacity to say in an interview that he was benefiting the environment.  His quarry operates with impunity.  That is wrong and needs to be tackled.<\/p>  <p>  Unless we succeed in bringing these rogue operators to heel, what kind of message are we sending to the good operators in my area and elsewhere who spend money to meet all of the standards and who respect the environment and the communities in which they are based?  We are sending out the wrong signal.  It is incumbent on the Government to put in place appropriate standards, put a body of law behind them and put funding in place to enforce them.  That must happen.  Otherwise, we will be equivocating.<\/p> <p>Today, I saw a leaflet of a Fine Gael councillor that could be mistaken for a Green Party leaflet with all of the green imagery it used.  There is an element of greenwashing by the Government as it attempts to give the impression it is green friendly.  It recognises the impact and negativity that are adding to the destruction of the environment.  It should stop the greenwashing and attempting to take credit for something it is not committed to.  It should show it is active by enforcing and enhancing the existing body of law to ensure standards are maintained and the environment is respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400036#PP00400","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575475800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>We all acknowledge that we need quarries but, like so many other things that we need, they come at a price.  Quarries certainly serve us in terms of the materials they deliver but they can cost local communities in terms of dust, noise pollution, water contamination and, in particular, extra traffic.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, lives in a rural setting.  People living in an area with more than 20 or 30 trucks laden with stone passing their house every day certainly do not have much peace.  There is also air, water and noise pollution and the impact of trucks thundering through small villages disturbing the peace of residents.  There is also the effect that quarries can have on water tables.  This is before we consider the potential destruction they cause to natural habitats and historic monuments.  No one can be in any doubt as to how much of an impact these industrial operations have on what are often very rural places and environments.<\/p>  <p>  Some quarry groups, organisations and companies fully adhere to the regulations and are good operators in every sense of the word.  However, I must mention the lack of planning and regulation for quarries, which is a national scandal and a serious problem.  One in eight quarries is unauthorised.  I cannot think of any other business that would be allowed to operate in such a regulatory vacuum.  Consider the situation I spoke about on Leaders' Questions regarding cr&egrave;che regulations, which could result in 50% of cr&egrave;ches being unable to open in January 2020 because they will not have the documentation required.  Under the regulations, that documentation must be issued by 12 December.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State not to tell us that these issues are beyond his control.  We do not want to see wholesale closures of quarries but it is essential that they are properly regulated and controlled.  I suggest they be monitored by local authorities because this does not happen at present.  I cannot think of any other business that would be allowed to operate day after day while planning permission was being sought.  Some quarry operators circumnavigate, twist and bend the law with impunity, challenging the implementation of regulations with appeals and taking judicial reviews, all the while continuing their operations.  They are not only flouting the law but laughing at it as they continue to extract and blast without permission.  This is certainly not always the case but it occurs far too often.<\/p>  <p>  It is time for an urgent review of this situation to bring these rogue operators into the net of efficiency and transparency.  I will give a few examples from my constituency of Kildare.  A 22 ha quarry close to the Curragh has been operating since 2014.  In 2015, the quarry was served with an enforcement notice stating that it did not have planning permission for what was being developed.  The owner was told that, if convicted, he could be fined up to &euro;12,000 and-or be jailed for up two years.  Unbelievably, the unauthorised quarrying continued for years.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la published a highly critical report about the quarry, stating it had significant effects on the environment but we did not need a report to tell us that.  We also had a case in Ballymany, where a developer said he was using the land for plant waste only.  In effect, it was a quarry and the residents in a nearby housing estate suffered for many years.  Many of our communities are simply not able for this level of disruption.  We must think about the cost to our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The Hill of Allen is a very historic site that is full of heritage.  It has been blasted away to surface our motorways and primary roads.  There are only two volcanic basalt hills in Ireland.  One is the Hill of Allen and the other is the Giant's Causeway.  No one is suggesting that we start quarrying the Giant's Causeway so why are we not concerned about the destruction of a prime heritage site in the centre of Kildare?  The Hill of Allen was the seat of Fionn Mac CumhailI and the Fianna.  Instead of celebrating this incredible historical resource, to which we could bring visitors from all over Ireland and the world to share one of our most important myths, we have stood by and allowed this hill become a victim of quarrying.  It is important to mention this because we have no idea of the true value of our land if we allow the destruction of a key historical site with recorded national monuments, a burial chamber and a cairn, not to mention the iconic tower on top of the hill, which is under threat from sustained blasting.<\/p>  <p>  Despite enforcement actions by local authorities and An Taisce, it is appalling that some unauthorised quarry operators have continued blasting.  This matter has to be addressed.  Fianna F&aacute;il is very concerned about it and we need the Minister of State to ensure it does not continue to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400037#QQ00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1575475800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Canney, addressed the environmental aspects of the Private Members' motion under discussion.  I will speak on the planning and quarrying related aspects of the motion, which fall within my area of responsibility at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p>  <p>  The \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme, \"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\", which aired last week, highlighted that one in eight quarries, or 151 out of 1,100 active quarries throughout the country operate without planning permission and are effectively unauthorised.  It is a serious situation that I do not think any Deputy in the House can condone under any circumstance.  I am glad Deputy O'Dea has tabled a motion so we can have this discussion.<\/p>  <p>  While the aggregate sector is a cornerstone of the construction industry, employing thousands of people and making an important contribution to economic development through providing building material for all forms of development, including housing, roads and water infrastructure as well as commercial and industrial development, it goes without saying that all operators in the aggregate sector, as with all other economic sectors, are expected to fully comply with their statutory obligations and adhere to the necessary laws of the State, as passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, in the interests of balance, and Deputy Dooley made a comment on this, it should also be acknowledged in this regard that a large majority of quarry operators operate in compliance with the law and adhere to their statutory obligations.  Unfortunately, it is a minority of quarries that operate outside the law and bring the sector into disrepute.<\/p>  <p>  We all know there are significant environmental impacts associated with quarrying operations in terms of noise, dust, blasting, vibration, impacts on water quality, groundwater, traffic, as mentioned by Deputy O'Loughlin, waste, ecosystems and landscapes, to name just some.  Quarries also have significant impacts on local communities and residents in whose vicinity they operate.  Accordingly, it is imperative that quarrying operations are appropriately regulated and comply with all relevant environmental requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The planning system is the system through which quarries are regulated in terms of being required to obtain planning permission before commencing operations and to comply with any conditions attached to planning permission where it is granted.  When assessing individual planning applications for quarries, planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate, must take into account the principle of proper planning and sustainable development, including a range of environmental health, transport, site suitability, visual, amenity and other relevant impacts of the proposed development.  Furthermore, where the development of a quarry may affect a special area of conservation, planning authorities are required to screen the development and undertake full appropriate assessment of the proposed development under the habitats directive, where necessary.<\/p> <p>It is fair to say the regulation of the sector has been a legacy issue since the Celtic tiger years and probably even before that.  Notwithstanding this, it should be noted that strenuous efforts have been made by my Department to improve the regulation and compliance of the sector through new legislation which came into effect in 2012 and which gives unauthorised quarries the opportunity to regularise their affairs by registering their activity with the local authority, obtaining substitute consent or retention permission for past unauthorised activity and obtaining planning permission for ongoing activity.  Unfortunately, while many regularised their activities, not all quarry operators availed of the opportunity provided at that time.  In addition, in May 2013 a ministerial policy directive was issued to planning authorities reminding them of their statutory obligations in planning, monitoring and enforcement, requiring them to ensure that sufficient resources were put in place for this purpose and, in particular, to prioritise action on large-scale unauthorised developments, including quarries.  Detailed guidelines were also issued to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, offering guidance to planning authorities on planning for the quarrying industry in local development plans and on determining planning applications for quarrying and ancillary activities in their functional areas.  These guidelines were also intended to be of assistance to the owners and operators of quarries in complying with their statutory obligations and meeting relevant environmental requirements.<br\/><br\/>While the situation relating to unauthorised quarries subsequently improved somewhat further following the enactment of the 2012 legislation - it was also helped by the downturn in economic activity at that time - the indications are, as outlined by the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme, that the number of unauthorised and unregulated quarries has been increasing again as construction activity has ramped up, which, in turn, has increased the demand for aggregate<b><\/b>material.  As has been referred to by Deputies, problems are also increasing.  In effect, the necessary planning legislation and guidance is already in place to facilitate the proper regulation of the sector.  However, under planning regulations and legislation, the enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission where it is unauthorised or where the terms and conditions of planning permission have not been met.  In this connection, there are extensive enforcement powers provided for in Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000, with a view to ensuring that works pertaining to permitted developments are carried out in accordance with planning permission and that no unauthorised development takes place.  Furthermore, if a person is of the view that any development works being undertaken are unauthorised, they may make a written complaint to the development planning authority, which is required to investigate the matter within established time frames and take any appropriate enforcement action, including, where necessary, seeking a court order requiring the cessation of operations.  It is also worth mentioning in this connection that serious breaches of the planning code that come before the courts can, on indictment, incur significant fines of potentially up to &euro;12 million in cases where significant environmental damage or pollution are caused and imprisonment of up to two years or both imprisonment and a fine, with further fines of up to &euro;10,000 for each day the offence is continued.<br\/><br\/>While the necessary legislation, enforcement powers and penalties are already in place, there is clearly a need for more proactive and effective enforcement of the legislation by planning authorities.  Married to this, there is also the need for the courts and the Judiciary to impose more serious penalties for breaches of the legislation by quarry operators that come before them, especially in cases involving consistent and persistent breaches of previous court orders that have continued to be ignored.  This will send out an appropriate signal and warning that non-compliance with statutory obligations will no longer be tolerated in this area.  In light of the information and evidence that has recently come to light in the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme on unauthorised activity in this area, my Department will soon engage further with planning authorities on the need for more decisive actions against illegal quarries, advising them to use more full use of the enforcement powers available to them so this problem can be better addressed and eradicated once and for all.<br\/><br\/>What is currently happening in this area is not acceptable in a modern democratic society where citizens and sectors have a civic responsibility to operate in compliance with the law of the State.  One particular point in the motion to which I would like to refer specifically mentions the alleged sourcing by local authorities of aggregate material from unauthorised quarrying operations.  It should not be the case that, for example, the roads and housing divisions of local authorities are sourcing material from unauthorised quarry operations that are in breach of the requirements of the planning code while another division of the local authority is taking enforcement action against those same operations, including taking action to cease operations.  This is something that should not be happening and my Department will soon write to local authorities to remind them of the need to adhere to the public procurement guidelines for goods and services, as published by the Office of Government Procurement, which requires that any materials, products or services being procured are sourced from authorised sources that are operating in compliance with relevant statutory requirements.<br\/><br\/>It is important to put on the record the Government's concerns on unauthorised activity in this area, as outlined in the motion.  I mention the concerted range of actions that have already been taken and the Government's commitment to continue to tackle the problem and to take whatever further actions necessary against concerned illegal operators in this field.  I take Deputy Dooley's point - Deputy O'Dea may have made the same point - that local authorities are often under pressure, when it comes to resources, in making these enforcement decisions and might often shy away from doing so because of the legal costs and consequences involved.  That is something the Department will engage with local authorities on more because it is important they feel they have the funding and backing to do this.  Often, a local authority can have the choice between spending the money on another positive development or taking a legal case and the choice is often made to spend the money elsewhere.  We will engage with them on that because it is important we look at that issue.  We have to strengthen local authorities so they are in a position to take these legal cases when they have to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400037#QQ00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575476400,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Lawless and O'Dea are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400038#RR00200","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1575476400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  We need to tackle this issue.  If the assertion that was made by RT&Eacute; was correct, that one in eight across Ireland is operating without planning permission, that is a serious issue.  Furthermore, if local authorities are buying from authorised quarries where they themselves are the planning authority, that also raises serious issues.  I have always believed that when the law is being widely ignored, the law is brought into total disrepute.  Sometimes it has to be considered whether the way the law operates is proportionate and reasonable.  We have a serious issue at which we need to look.  We must ensure that everyone complies with the law.  My understanding up until I saw the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme was always that if one was not in compliance, the first thing one was told to do by the local authority was to desist from whatever business one was in and then one could seek retention, or in this case, substitute consent.  I always had an understanding about what would happen in a case where one did not desist from whatever activity, irrespective of what enforcement was involved.  For example, if one was using a private premises for commercial purposes and one did not have permission to do so, one would have to desist.  My understanding was that a local authority would seek a court injunction and restrain one by the order of the court from doing what one was doing.  To see that people can go on carrying out major works consistently seems to me to be a serious issue.  We need to develop a much more comprehensive policy on the extractive industry.  We want an extractive industry, we want it to be compliant and we want it to be environmentally sensitive.  We also have to look at making it possible for small quarries to operate in isolated areas.  Otherwise, we will ruin the roads and cause a huge carbon footprint by bringing vast amounts of material over long distances.  We need to move forward, regularise all of this, make it workable and then enforce the law fully.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue at which we must look is the substitute consent mechanism, particularly when somebody wants to use a disused quarry for some other purpose.  We need to make it easier to apply for permission to use quarries for legitimate purposes, such as using them for recreational purposes as quarries are good for rock climbing and so on.  We need to make that process easier so we can rehabilitate and reuse quarries, which in many cases are eyesores, for productive and legal purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400038#RR00300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1575477000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I have heard many references to the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme during the debate.  While I have not watched it, I have extensive experience of dealing with quarries, landfills and so on in my constituency, both as a Deputy and previously as a member of the local authority.  It is only fair at this point to go a little against the tide and say they are not all bad and they are not all the same.  In fact, quarry owners and operators are employers and provide local employment, and they tend to be small, often family, businesses.  In light of the jobs they provide, they have a secondary economic impact.  It is tough, rough work that can be dangerous at times.  Some of them take their obligations seriously, both as employers and in respect of safety, run a tight ship, and try to derive a profit margin for their employees and stakeholders, which should be recognised.<\/p>  <p>  As always, the few ruin it for the many.  The \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme suggested that one in eight quarries is unauthorised while more than one in eight may be authorised and follow the letter of the law but not the spirit.  There are many cowboys in the sector.  I am reminded of one in particular in my constituency, namely, the A1 waste facility in Kerdiffstown, near Sallins, which has practised every violation under the sun for more than 20 years.  The EPA was initially slow to engage until it was forced to the table by local residents' associations.  The landfill and former quarry came to a halt when a blaze broke out at Christmas a number of years ago that was visible from the M7, such was its extent.  It drew national attention, and the EPA and Kildare County Council finally acted to address the issue, although it took far too long.  The happy ending is that a public park will be developed on the site to become a public amenity with a path and connection to the greenway.  I recognise the work of Kildare County Council and of the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, who was supportive of the project, as were his predecessors.<\/p>  <p>  One of the secondary impacts of such operations, aside from the overspill on the immediate vicinity, is the impact on local roads.  Local rural byroads tend to be traversed by heavy goods vehicles such as lorries and trucks entering and exiting, and it is often debatable whether the empty or laden trucks rattle more.  Either way, they are not suitable for local rural roads.  Sometimes, the State itself or State agencies can be complicit.  I have previously raised in the House the issue of the Drehid landfill in north-west Kildare, a Bord na M&oacute;na site that has irritated many landowners and residents, not only in the immediate vicinity but along all the approach roads, from Prosperous and Clane to Sallins, Allenwood, Killeen and beyond, as truckers find the route of least resistance and plough through at high speeds in articulated lorries travelling in both directions many times a day.  Broadford in north-west Kildare also suffers, and a recent example is the Millpond site, where water quality issues continue to be raised and fingers have been pointed at a number of local pits and operations.  That may or may not be the case, but it certainly does not do anything to build the trust of the residents when it takes so long for their water to become drinkable.  The media descended when there was a boil water notice for much of the greater Dublin area, but the residents of Broadford have been unable to drink the water for two or three years.<\/p>  <p>  Some positives have emerged, not least in respect of the circular economy.  Earlier in this D&aacute;il term, I introduced an amendment to legislation on the potential for old mines to be rehabilitated to allow rare earth minerals, which are important components for electronics such as iPhones, to be extracted.  For quarries, in the same way, we can tidy up legislation already in place.  It is a good opportunity for the circular economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400039#SS00100","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1575477000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues and everybody else who spoke on the motion.  I read Deputy Cullinane's amendment and, given that I do not disagree with any of it, I am disposed to accept it.  I take the opportunity to refer to a small group in Limerick, Limerick Against Pollution, that has stood in the ditch to resist the proposal.  It is a small, dedicated group that has worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of its area, and every man, woman and child who is potentially affected by the proposal in Mungret owes it a great deal of gratitude.  Even though the group is small in number and badly financed - it sells tickets and holds events such as raffles to raise funding - it is supported by thousands of people, including all the political parties in the area and none.  I have attended most of the public meetings and rallies, where Fine Gael representatives were among the most vehement in their opposition to the proposal.  They were fully on the side of the community and some were almost ready to lay down their lives to protect the community.  It will be interesting, therefore, to see how their party colleagues in the House will respond to the motion and whether they will accept it.  I am not playing politics but rather making a last-ditch effort to prevent a calamity in my community.  I heard nothing in the responses of the Ministers of State, especially in that of Deputy Canney, that will afford any comfort or consolation to the people on whose behalf I am speaking.<\/p>  <p>  The people of Limerick are watching the debate closely.  The matter is in the heart of 25,000 residents, and 4,500 objections to it have been submitted.  If the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, wishes to reflect on the matter overnight, he can, but the people are watching the debate carefully.  If there is a marked difference between the approaches of Fine Gael in the House and Fine Gael on the ground in Limerick, people will naturally ask why.  I ask the Minister and the Government to give careful consideration to the proposal.  The Ministers of State outlined nothing in respect of incineration except for a vague promise that the Government is committed to a circular economy at some indeterminate time in the future, like St. Augustine, who wrote, \"O God, make me good, but not yet.\"  We heard nothing about the proposal in Mungret.  If, as the Ministers of State asserted, we recognise that change must come and the whole system has to be recast, why will we not pause the proposal for yet another incinerator that will have a lifetime of 20 or 30 years?  Such proposals are now resisted by communities in other countries that realise they were mistaken, while we are aware of the problems yet seem determined to make the same mistake.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government to accept the motion, as amended, to show good faith and to demonstrate that it and its representatives on the ground in Limerick are on the same wavelength.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400039#SS00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575477000,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575477000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Motion, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Microbeads (Prohibition) Bill 2019: Order for Report Stage","time":1575477000,"counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400039#SS00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1575477000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400039#SS00600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575477000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Microbeads (Prohibition) Bill 2019: Report and Final Stages","time":1575477000,"counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400039#SS00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575477000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Bill received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575477000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1575477000,"counter":490,"content":"<p>What we are doing in respect of microbeads is significant.

Most of the voluntary groups I am familiar with in west Cork organise and play bingo to try to raise funds for the local hall or local charitable event.  Those funds help to keep festivals going in places such as Goleen, Kilbrittain, Bandon, Clonakilty or wherever bingo games are held weekly.

A tiered system is in place there where commercial bingo operations come under a different regulatory regime than community events.

We should not be encouraging people in communities that have been left vulnerable to robbery because of Garda station closures, etc., to carry significant amounts of money.  The easiest way to deal with this is to recommit the Bill in respect of section 12 to enable a simple amendment to be made which would clarify our intention to provide for a tiered process that covers the commercial operators, which the Minister of State is trying to address in this legislation, and the community bingo events across the country, which we want to allow to continue to function as they have functioned up to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400041#UU02400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575478800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

To the best of my knowledge, many of these establishments are not member-based clubs in the same way as we might understand sports clubs, for example.  The membership is frequently not a stable feature and it may vary considerably from night to night.  Many of these establishments seem to hold themselves to be casinos and I am not in favour of any measure that would facilitate commercial casino operations by the back door at this time.

On further consideration of this point and in the context of this type of gaming, I am now of the view that this provision does not serve a useful purpose and I propose its deletion.  I am proposing a different paragraph (<i>e<\/i>) that will require information on stake and prize limits and the name of the intended beneficiary to be prominently displayed at the normal means of access to the premises proposed to be used for gaming.

However, it has been brought to my attention that such may not be technically feasible where the lottery, for example, is conducted by way of bingo.  In that regard, tickets may be bought in books and played using a mechanical or a digital device to mark off the numbers.  Bingo is different in this regard from other lotteries, which primarily involve the purchase of a ticket.  Thus, amendments Nos. 9 and 10 allow for the public display of the required information.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 12 concerns section 12 inserting the new section 28 into the principal Act.  It is a textual amendment to introduce a reference to a new subsection (2) in amendment No. 13.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 13 provides a new subsection (2) to section 33 of the principal Act concerning the public display of the necessary information that might otherwise be contained on a ticket.  There is a requirement in the new section 28(10)(b) of the principal Act, as inserted by section 12 of the Bill, to display the value of each prize and the intended beneficiary on every lottery ticket or coupon.  However, where the lottery has been conducted by way of bingo, for example, such display may not be technically feasible, so we are doing it in a far easier way for people who are running these bingos.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400045#YY01600","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575480900,"counter":568,"content":"<p>The first Member who indicated is Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400046#ZZ00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1575480900,"counter":569,"content":"<p>This is terribly important.

That is the reason we must be 100% sure about what the Minister of State is proposing.  People who run bingo events have been very uncertain about what is being proposed.

It is my understanding that it is not possible to do so for bingo games.  I take the advice of Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and others who say that the prizes given in a bingo hall are determined by the number of people who attend.  It is a long time since I was at bingo but my understanding was that there was a given prize per line, box and page.  That was set before people attended and they knew what it was every night.  The crowd attending determined how much profit was made on the night.  If there was a big crowd, the organisers did well and, if there was a small crowd, they did poorly.  That brings us to the issue, to which we will come later, of the amount that can be given out in prizes.  That is the core of the matter.  It probably would be possible to print what the prizes are on the front of each bingo book.  Apart from that, the amendments provide that a large sign setting out the prize money would be displayed at the door or as one enters the premises.  Perhaps things have changed but it is not my experience that the prizes change every night.  The prizes set for a bingo hall are standard every time one goes.  I hope that remains the case.

It is an outlet for people one, two or three nights a week.  Like Deputy Kenny, I will speak to my own understanding.  At my local bingo event, and in the local bingo events around us, a set amount of money is paid out every night.  In our case, it is approximately &euro;1,300.  We sometimes pay out 70% or 80% of the money collected.  Sometimes we pay out 110% because, if we have a bad night or the roads are bad, the organisers are still committed to paying out that set amount.  People expect that and it is paid out.  I understand that organisers are given a permit to run a bingo game and that any game which pays out less than &euro;5,000 will not be affected by the Bill.  Am I right in that?  It will not affect bingo games which pay out less than &euro;5,000.  Once a permit has been granted, things are fine.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is that of the jackpot but this would seldom exceed &euro;5,000 in any event.  Sometimes it is capped at a given figure.  In our case, it is capped at &euro;3,000.  The Bill will not really affect this either.<\/p>  <p>  Many clubs run lotteries.  My understanding is that there is no issue with a normal lotto with a prize of up to &euro;30,000.  Am I right in that?  A lotto prize could run on for 12 months and keep increasing.  In some cases, the prize is capped at &euro;20,000, but it can exceed that.  Nothing will change for such lotteries if the prize stays under &euro;30,000.

I seek clarification from the Minister of State.  Will the proposed section 26A apply to this particular operation?  This section states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSection 26 shall not apply to a lottery where&mdash;  \t(a) the total value of the prizes is not more than &euro;1,000,<br \/><br \/>(b) the price of each ticket is not more than &euro;5,<br \/><br \/>(c) the maximum number of tickets sold is not more than 1,500,<br \/><br \/>(d) the lottery is conducted for the benefit of a charitable or philanthropic purpose, and<br \/><br \/>(e) the promoter of the lottery derives no personal profit from the lottery and has not conducted a lottery in accordance with this section during the preceding 3 months.  <\/blockquote>  <p>To be fair to the Minister of State, he is my constituency colleague and I do not believe he would seek to shut down operations such as this.  I welcome the opportunity for the Minister of State to give these voluntary organisations some clarity and comfort tonight.  The return to the bingo game in Kildorrery, and in every community across the land, it makes a few bob for the GAA, the local development association and community endeavours.  It is not for profit.

What will be the threshold for such lotteries?  There is reference to a figure of &euro;360,000 in the legislation.  Given the value of particular houses in particular parts of the country, that threshold of &euro;360,000 could easily be surpassed.  I am coming from a place of ignorance in this regard.  I seek to be educated by the Minister of State on that point.<\/p><p>Those are the key points.

That is not the case.  There are very many bingo players in my constituency of Dublin Bay South.  Women from Pearse Street play bingo in St. Andrew's Resource Centre at least once a week and they derive great enjoyment from it.  If I can level some degree of criticism at the Minister of State, the legislation has not been explained well to people.  The word has gone abroad that the Bill will, in some way, shut down bingo halls throughout the country.  From my reading of the legislation, that is not correct.  The Minister needs to announce the effect of this legislation in the Chamber tonight.  We see from the legislation that it attempts to regulate lotteries.  Of course, bingo is a form of lottery but it is not the only type.  As Deputy Sherlock just mentioned, under the new section 26A of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 proposed in the legislation, if prizes total less than &euro;1,000, there is no need to worry about the Act.<\/p> <p>Organisers will not need to go to a superintendent or the District Court.  They will not need to worry about divvying up the pot into shares of 50% for prizes and 25% for charity.  It will not matter what they do.  The Minister of State should clarify that there is no issue if prizes are &euro;1,000 or less with no more than 1,500 tickets.  Many of the bingo games in this country fall within that range.<\/p> <p> If the prize is between &euro;1,000 and &euro;5,000, organisers will need to get a lottery permit.  They will have to approach a Garda superintendent, who will issue a permit if the requirements are fulfilled.  It is important to point out that lottery permits for games with prizes of between &euro;1,000 and &euro;5,000 contain no requirement for the pot to be divvied up into shares of 50% for prizes, 25% for the organiser and 25% for charity.  That requirement only applies to higher-level bingo games with prizes of between &euro;5,000 and &euro;30,000 per week.  Organisers of those games have to go to the District Court and apply for a licence.  These games are subject to a requirement that no more than 50% of the take goes towards prizes.  Up to 25% can go to organising costs and at least 25% must be for charity.  This has not been explained well.  It is complicated legislation and we need to provide confidence to the people who play bingo.  Nobody is trying to stop bingo.  Why would we want to stop it?  There may be other people who want to stop this legislation, but I do not think bingo players are trying to stop it.  We need to communicate the provisions of this legislation properly.  I hope the Minister of State will provide clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400047#AAA02300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575482100,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I will pick up where my colleagues finished.  There is a lack of clarity around this issue.  Earlier in the week I was contacted on this issue by Councillor Valerie Byrne, who is involved in organising bingo in Elphin in County Roscommon.  Hers is very typical of the situation throughout the country.  I spoke directly to the Minister of State on a few occasions in the past 48 hours about my concerns regarding community organisations throughout the country that run bingo games as a social outlet.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that the distribution cap limiting prize money to a maximum of 50% of the pot does not apply to any bingo game awarding less than &euro;5,000 in prize money on any one particular night.  The Minister of State might also clarify the situation regarding jackpots.  If a jackpot reached the &euro;3,000 mark referred to by Deputy Eamon Scanlon earlier and there was a big crowd in the hall, could a game end up going over this threshold?  This would be an isolated incident.  Could a mechanism be introduced to annualise these figures?  That cap would not be a problem for those games if prize money was averaged out over 52 weeks, as the average would be much less than &euro;5,000.  As Deputy Scanlon has noted, the people I have spoken to are concerned that because a guaranteed sum of money is awarded each week, a figure of 110% could be allocated in some weeks.  People are not going to go to a bingo game if they do not know how much prize money they can win.<\/p>  <p>  Last night I gave the Minister of State the example of Northern Ireland, where there is a tiered system regulating bingo.  Professional commercial outfits are regulated differently from the community bingo games in Northern Ireland.  From reading section 11, which deals with lottery licences, it seems that a similar approach is being taken here.  We are not prohibiting the practices of the bingo halls found in Elphin or throughout Roscommon, east Galway and the rest of the country.  A lack of clarity about this is part of the problem.  I received a briefing note from the Minister of State's Department that did not provide the clarity we seem to be getting from going through the legislation tonight.  That is disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  Personally, I was surprised to receive an email from a public relations consultant who was quite concerned about parish bingo games throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400048#BBB00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1575482100,"counter":620,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400048#BBB00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1575482100,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I doubt very much that any PR consultant based here in the city of Dublin is very worried about the bingo games that go on in Elphin, Castlerea, Ballinasloe, Roscommon or anywhere else for that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400048#BBB00400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1575482100,"counter":622,"content":"<p>What about here in Dublin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400048#BBB00500","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1575482100,"counter":623,"content":"<p>That raises the concern there may be another agenda at play here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400048#BBB00600","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1575482100,"counter":624,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400048#BBB00700","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1575482100,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I am not pursuing that.  I am focused solely on the community groups throughout this country that run bingo games as a social outlet.  I want to see that continue.  Deputy O'Callaghan is correct.  Some bingo games are operated on a more professionally organised basis here in Dublin.  I was talking to Deputy Martin Kenny during the vote earlier.  He suggested amending section 12 to bring the 50% threshold for prize money up to 75% for those bigger operators while protecting the 25% for charity.  If an operator runs a bingo game for a charity, then I have no difficulty with the charity getting that money, particularly where a big operator is involved.  My focus is on protecting the small communities throughout this country.  It is important that the Minister of State clarifies that nothing will change for those groups where the total prize money is less than &euro;5,000.  I ask him to consider introducing some flexibility to that definition so that where those groups have a roll-over jackpot, they do not come a cropper because of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise two other very brief points.  One is the point made by Deputy Sherlock about houses.  As the Minister of State knows, Club Rossie in Roscommon recently ran a very successful raffle in which a house here in Dublin was awarded.

I will lump all my remarks into one contribution because I do not wish to hold matters up.  I did my own research before coming into the House tonight.  Unlike Deputy Healy-Rae, my research indicated that people who organise community bingo games have to have the money laid out in advance.  They have to know what it will cost them to run a community bingo game.<\/p> <p>In my research I found that the cost of a double book, which would fall under the lottery permit and the maximum price of a ticket, would be &euro;10.  The cost of a single book is &euro;7 and a baby book is &euro;4.  A person pays &euro;3 for the gamble and &euro;3 for the jackpot.  If the organiser happens to have 100 people sitting in the parish hall, he or she is running the bingo at a loss.  Technically, the payout for the night would be &euro;1,590 but the organiser's income on the night is only &euro;1,510.  This does not take into consideration the heat, insurance and rent.  Straight away the organiser is down &euro;320.  If, however, the organiser manages to bring in 150 people, the income is now at &euro;2,175 and he she can break even and have a profit of &euro;160.  Portumna Rugby Club runs bingo nights and we would be delighted to see 150 to 200 people at it.  Loughrea Rugby Club also runs its own bingo nights and it too would be delighted to see 200 people.  When 200 people sit in the room, the income is &euro;2,900 and the organiser can make a little profit and have something to buy the jerseys with.<\/p> <p> Out of every week's income &euro;100 must always be left aside for the jackpot.  This is where I want some clarification from the Minister of State.  Perhaps it is different from Deputy Scanlon's point, but some community groups do not put a limit on it.  As the jackpot gets larger, the crowd gets bigger.  When the jackpot hits &euro;5,000, for example, the bingo night could attract more than 250 people.  Any parish hall or community would be delighted to see 250 people coming into the community once a week.  When they come in, they are also stopping, shopping and using the Local Link and so on.

It is one point of contact and it is just a bit of common sense.  This is up for the day.  May we also have clarification that this is acceptable?

I am thinking of clubs such as Duleek Bellewstown GAA with its drive-in bingo and the Gibbstown drive-in bingo.  Ashbourne-Stamullen will hold its annual bingo night tonight.

The mental health of the elderly was used to pursue an agenda, but we really do not know what the agenda was.  Deputies who took part in the lobbying campaign should think very carefully about that.  When Members lobby on particular issues, we need to look at the issue ourselves before jumping the gun and examine it carefully.  When I was contacted by some people about it, I spoke to my colleagues, Deputies O'Callaghan and Rabbitte, who are well versed on the issues.  A good explanation was given by Deputy O'Callaghan and Deputy Rabbitte has put good questions to the Minister of State for clarification.  It is important that the Minister of State clarifies the position.<\/p>  <p>  It is not right that lobbying campaigns would jump on the bandwagon and undertake an extremely professional operation, with the quality of the posters outside Leinster House, alleging that bingo was under threat.  It is not.  It is important that we pay tribute here to all the volunteers who undertake bingo nights throughout the country and the enjoyment that people get from it through socialisation.<\/p>  <p>  We must put the fears to rest and let it be a lesson to Deputies who might be persuaded by sharp-suited lobbyists that they should relax a little before jumping on a bandwagon.  I look forward to the Minister of State's clarifications.  It is important that this happens and that he explains exactly what the rules are so people can know they are playing by the rules and can organise their games by the rules.<\/p>  <p>  Bingo has various forms.

Gambling addicts, however, do not have a high profile.  They do not have lobbyists speaking on their behalf and running to Deputies when there is a problem.  Gambling addicts are sitting at home and may be watching this debate.  I am sure they would not have a problem with people enjoying community bingo or minor gambling.

The debate on Report Stage of this legislation has such interest for two reasons.  First, there is a very effective lobby group out there.  Second, the Minister of State did not get clarity out to the public quickly enough in response.  I was confused up to yesterday but I got clarification having spoken to Deputy O'Callaghan and other Deputies.  I was fully happy going home last night and I put a tweet out this morning supporting the legislation.  I also met a group of the lobby people in the coffee dock here today.  I do not know if they will list meeting with me as part of their lobbying activities - I have no idea on that one.  When I left that meeting only a few hours ago, I was further confused again.  I went back to Deputy O'Callaghan and his staff who clarified the whole issue.<\/p>  <p>  There has been mass confusion over several days.  I was in my local town of Mountrath, in Laois, at the weekend where I was asked what was I doing \"up there stopping the bingo\".  There is a lesson here for the Minister of State's Department.  Some of the correspondence that went out confused permits, licences and lottery operators.<\/p> <p>The Bill, however, does not apply to any of the people who believed they were affected.  The local community group, be it a hall committee, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, a parish council or a soccer or GAA club, is not affected, but it believed it was.<\/p> <p> This Bill has a benefit.  Under the old legislation, some of these groups were technically only allowed to run two lotteries per year.  That restriction will be gone under the Bill and groups will be able to run bingo weekly or monthly if they ask a chief superintendent and place limits on their prize funds.  That is an improvement.<\/p> <p> I call the bingo in my community centre on the second Sunday of every month.  If anyone wants to come to Castletown in County Laois on Sunday, he or she might win &euro;3,000.  That is my plug.

An operator could sell 1,500 tickets for less than &euro;5 each and pay out less than &euro;1,000.  Someone could raise &euro;7,500 and clear &euro;6,500.  I think of the small raffles that parents councils are running in primary and secondary schools.  They are selling one ticket for &euro;2 or three tickets for &euro;5.  They will be able to pay out up to &euro;1,000 and happily operate without having to ask the Garda for a permit because they will be below the limit requiring one.  It is good that this has been clarified.<\/p> <p> One grouping might need a bit of clarification, though.  I know all of the bingo games in the Laois area.  They advertise set prizes.  They pay out &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 and people know how much single lines, double lines and full houses are worth as the games go on.  Even under the current arrangements, that information can be stuck up on a door.  However, there is another arrangement whereby some games split the pot or bucket.  Depending on what they collect in a raffle during the course of a week, they might agree to pay out 50% of it.  Sometimes, the amounts cannot be determined, but once the prize money is under &euro;1,000, the small games will have nothing to worry about.  I wanted to make that point, as I am familiar with games that run &euro;2 tickets every week and there are 20 promoters in a parish.  It is small money.  They will not have to ring their local garda&iacute; once the prize fund is under &euro;1,000 and the game is being run for charitable or philanthropic purposes.  That means \"for the good of the community\" in simple English.  People worry about big words, so we have to tell them what they mean in simple English.<\/p> <p> The provision relating to the maximum prize of &euro;5,000 covers most of the lotteries that I know.  I am not expressing any interest in major commercial lotteries.  The Revenue Commissioners and the lotteries' accountants should be ensuring that every penny they collect is properly recorded in their books and audited and that they pay their proper corporation taxes like everyone else.  Making sure that a commercial operator is paying its tax is not the Minister of State's function, but other State authorities should be dealing with them and we should not allow their issues to be conflated with those of others.  They are being conflated, however.  The people whom I met today conflated some of the issues, for example, licenceholders with permitholders.<\/p> <p> It is important that the Minister of State understand one of the queries raised with me today concerning something that is in the legislation.  People told me that the holder of the permit could only retain 5% of the proceeds.  I went away a few hours ago wondering what it was about.  I will explain what it means.  If I am a trustee of the local hall and I get a permit in my name on behalf of the community hall, I might need to incur some legal expenses.  I would be allowed a maximum of 5% of the proceeds.  Although no trustee of any hall keeps a penny, there is provision allowing for a trustee's legal costs to be covered.  We were told only a few hours ago that the pemitholder could only hold 5% of the gross proceeds.  I am not sure whether they did not know what they were talking about or were deliberately trying to mislead the Oireachtas.  It could have been one or the other.<\/p> <p> If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle indulges me, I am almost finished.  Once a lottery exceeds &euro;5,000, it must go to the District Court.  That should not be an issue.  This is where the percentages clock in with regard to prizes, operating costs and the amount that goes to charitable of philanthropic purposes.  There is a cap of &euro;30,000.  Some of the large lotteries roll over.  Some parishes have hit big lotteries, though.  In practice, they might have had voluntary ceilings.  That will now be in legislation.  A ceiling stops a roll-over.  If a lottery keeps rolling over from &euro;28,000 to &euro;29,000 to &euro;30,000, it will stop at &euro;30,000.  A lottery cannot exceed that amount.  Some lotteries might start building up a second jackpot to be won in a later week.  When the big jackpot is won, the second one coming behind it will already be halfway up to the cap.  I see the Minister of State's officials looking at him wondering whether an amendment is necessary to cover a second jackpot that is creeping up at the same time, but we will move on and take the legislation as it is before us.<\/p> <p> A great deal of confusion was caused during the week by a certain sector that came to lobby, but the Department could have helped to assuage much of that.  We are there now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400049#CCC00900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575483300,"counter":639,"content":"<p>We are where we are.

The Government's proposals, for which the Minister of State has responsibility, are that there will be a revised structure for how the financial elements of bingo are divvied out - costs, prizes and charitable donations.  At the very least, the Minister of State should have sent every Member a detailed letter outlining what he proposed to do and how it would work.

The Minister of State's motives may have been well meant but he seriously needs to explain to people, and particularly to women, up and down the country what exactly it is that he proposes to do, why he proposes to do it and what impact it will have on a fairly harmless fun pastime that is at the heart of a lot of communities up and down the country.<\/p> <p> Earlier today, I understood the Minister of State was going to send us out a letter or a card with the details of what he was proposing so we in turn could pass it on to people and tell them they do not need to worry because this is what will happen and how it will happen.

The Minister of State has raised a question, particularly in the minds of the organisers, as to whether they will now have to meet more stringent conditions and new regulations.  I am not clear as to whether the Minister of State will bring new regulations.  I know the legislation is fairly simple but are there regulations to give effect to what the Minister of State is proposing on bingo?  I would say from my ministerial experience that there probably will be a need for regulations.  Why is the Minister of State visiting all of this on people?  It is a total waste of the Department's time and resources.  Really, the Department of Justice and Equality should be doing better things with its time and money than threatening a pastime that is so important, particularly to women.<\/p>  <p>  Those who regularly visit people in nursing homes will know that in many nursing homes bingo is offered one or two days a week.

I still do not know why the Minister of State has it in the legislation.  Perhaps he should introduce a side Bill that deals with bingo only but I would not advise that either.

It may well be the case that some of the smaller bingo operations will not be affected adversely by the legislation but it is the case that there are bingo operations that fall into the larger category and have pots over the threshold.  It is the case potentially that some of them are community based.  It is also the case that some of them are profit-based.  We are all more inclined to support charitable community-based bingo and with good reason.  Many bingo operations started in this way.  As far as I am aware, it is not the intention of the Department to make it difficult for the profit-making venues to operate.  There are many such venues and they employ a lot of people.  I appreciate it is not the intention but it appears to be the case that under the legislation it will be difficult to run these premises and to run a community or voluntary operation with a very large pot as it would require the prize money to be under 50%.<\/p>  <p>  I was not in the Chamber at the time but I understand the Minister has accepted recommittal of the Bill and that is welcome.  A very constructive and sensible proposition was raised previously by Deputy Martin Kenny.  This is that the 25% charitable portion would be preserved but the maximum prize limit would be 75%.  It would then be on the organisation to make the call on its own profits and running costs and the prize pot, which could vary from week to week.  An organisation could calculate how it might work for it.  It would preserve the purpose of what the Minister of State is trying to achieve, which is to ensure a portion is safeguarded and ring-fenced for a charitable purpose but it would also allow bingo operators the flexibility to ensure they can offer an attractive pot and run a viable business.  They would have discretion within that as to their own running costs and profits and the prize fund.  Leave it up to them.  That is a very sensible and constructive proposition and I ask the Minister of State to consider it.<\/p>  <p>  On Committee Stage we discussed a number of issues and I asked the Minister of State to consider them over the summer.  At that time, we anticipated that Report Stage might be taken immediately after the summer.  We discussed stakes when debating Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment, which he withdrew, to reduce the stake from &euro;10 to &euro;5.  The Minister of State has tabled amendments to this effect.  I still have a little concern about this because the point I raised with the Minister of State has never been clarified.  My understanding is that the legislation would be interpreted whereby every line in a machine would be treated as a game.  I gave the analogy of betting a lucky 15 or a lucky 31 on horses where each line is a separate bet.  Someone might put down one note for a lucky 31 but they are 31 lines in the bet.  In a similar way, if the lever is pulled there may be several lines in a game for the stake.  What one might imagine to be a maximum of a &euro;5 stake could have 25 lines.  That is 25 by &euro;5.  There is an issue and I have never had it clarified.  I am still concerned about this.  I am not sure the legislation captures it.  If it is the case it is a big issue and people could spend an awful lot of money.  It needs to be fixed.  There is a constructive solution on the table that I believe could be to the satisfaction of many Deputies across the board.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to consider that because it could get us out of the difficulty this legislation faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400051#EEE00800","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575484500,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I will let Deputy Mattie McGrath in briefly before I go back to the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400052#FFF00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1575484500,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I am just seeking clarification on one point.

We are probably already dealing with it to some extent in the conversation we are having but that would be a wise way forward.  While Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned I had proposed a solution, I had not formally proposed it here but I want us to look at the 50% the Government is talking about as being the cap on the prize money.  If that was moved to 75% it would be up to the operator to decide what portion of that they would be able to put back out in prize money.  The 25% going to charitable causes is at the root of this and that is what we need to see happen.  Many of the big operators that currently get a licence to run bingo, get that licence on the premise they will give a portion of the takings to charity.  The current legislation does not say how much must go to charity so they run the bingo, they have a large profit and they give 1% or nothing to charity.  This legislation will force them to give 25% to charity.  That is what it does, that part of the legislation is appropriate and we need to do that.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is an issue that needs to be addressed, namely that in order for bingo to be viable the pot has to be above 50%.  That is where we run into the problem and unless we can deal with that we will have an issue but we can find a solution to that.  The smaller bingo operators I deal with in rural Ireland give out less than &euro;5,000 in prize money per week so they come under the permit section and that does not apply to them at all.  That would be the case with most of the bingo operators I know such as those that operate in small GAA clubs and community centres around the country.  They would be giving out less than &euro;5,000 per week and many of them would be giving out less than &euro;5,000 per month in prize money.  They do not come into this, therefore.

Is it the case that bingo is a form of entertainment?  Is it valid to say that with this form of entertainment in which a lot of people participate, enjoy and get a lot of satisfaction from, there should be an imposition of a requirement to donate 25% of the proceeds to charity?  How fair is that as an approach?  If the Government is saying that about fundraising, that is one thing.  I am not setting these down as being my firm beliefs but I am asking if there is an issue with requiring a commercial operation to make a 25% contribution to charity.  The other aspect is the limit of 50% of the takings going into the prize fund.  Again, I have to say I do not know a huge amount about the economics or mechanics of bingo but my understanding is there is flexibility in that.  Sometimes 80% of the pot might be given back in prize money and sometimes it might be less.  Much of the flexibility that currently exists is used to create excitement, to encourage more business and to encourage people to come back or on a quiet night, more than 50% of the takings might go out on prize money.  Those are the arguments that are made.  There is an extent to which the priorities are skewed in this.<\/p>  <p>  I admit straight off I was not involved on Committee Stage at all but it strikes me that some of the big problems associated with gambling in this country are not being addressed in this legislation.  For example, we are not getting the regulator and we are increasing the stake in a way that is likely to cause more social problems for people who have addiction problems.  At the same time, the Government is including bingo in gaming and gambling when that is not what it actually is because there is no legal definition of bingo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400052#FFF01200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1575484500,"counter":684,"content":"<p>There is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400052#FFF01300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1575484500,"counter":685,"content":"<p>The Government is therefore lumping bingo in with all lotteries and gambling and because of that it is not regarded as a separate activity in its own right.

Another thing has transpired here tonight.  Every one of us, as elected Members, give 100% support to the small bingo operators that are raising funds for this club or that club or perhaps a person with a medical problem, for example, might have a bingo event organised for them or a bingo event might be organised to keep a local club going, be it a sports club or a community centre.  We should also remember there is nothing wrong with monster bingos.  In the Irish National Event Centre, INEC, in the Gleneagle Hotel complex in County Kerry, for instance, a monster bingo event was held four or five weeks ago.<\/p> <p>I played bingo there that day and was delighted to be there.  Perhaps 2,500 to 3,000 people were playing bingo and the place was at capacity.  It was a lovely Sunday afternoon and the people thronged.  They came from everywhere to Kerry to play bingo that day.  On the other side of the border, in County Cork, there are monster bingo events.  Does the Minister of State know about the bingo week held in Limerick?  Points made during the debate have given the impression we should be against monster bingo events.  There is nothing wrong with people who organise a monster bingo event.  People attend such events and play bingo just for one day or for a week, where they play bingo during the day and into the night.  They have a good, sociable time and if they want to take a break from a few games, they go outside and have a bit of time to themselves.  They stay in hotels and have a great time.

I was out of the country dealing with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination for the past couple of days.  I was away from Sunday until last night and the issue blew up while I was gone.  I tried to deal with it on a connecting flight from Paris and determine what was going on.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was published two years ago.  It passed all Stages in the Seanad, and Second Stage and Committee Stage in this House.  Now, at the 11th hour, it has all blown up.  Some colleagues, including Deputy Thomas Byrne and O'Callaghan, noted that a major, professional lobbying campaign was taking place.  Deputy Martin Kenny also referred to it.  Let us not be fooled about it: that is what happened at the last minute and it was an attempt to derail the Bill.  I ask colleagues not to fall for that and to be wise to what is happening.  People have called for a long time for regulation of gambling, gaming and lotteries, and this is the start of it.  While it is modest, the issue has been overblown.  Let us imagine what will happen when we introduce a regulator and get to grips with the heavy aspects.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation is in place, including the 1956 Act.  The Bill will update that.  It is quite modest and no more.  Under the legislation, which was amended in 2013, running a lottery with a prize fund of up to &euro;5,000 requires a permit from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that can be done every week.  With the permit, away you go, and the lottery can be run.  In 1965, the courts defined bingo as a lottery.  It was decided in the Doherty judgment and I can convey the details to Deputy Shortall.  For bingo events, there can be a payout of up to &euro;5,000 every week, and in the case of the vast majority of local bingos in rural areas, that is what happens and the payouts are well under that.  I have checked what is done in my area, where the payout is sometimes as high as &euro;3,000 but that is it.  Organisers are well covered with the permit and no change will be made at that level.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan pointed out that we will introduce an alleviation to lotteries held for charitable or philanthropic purposes not requiring a permit or licence.  Section 9 states that section 26A of the principal Act will not apply to a lottery where the total value of the prize is not more than &euro;1,000, where the price of each ticket is not more than &euro;5, where the maximum number of tickets sold is 1,500, where the lottery is conducted for the benefit of a charity and where the promoter of the charity derives no personal benefit, as long as he or she has not conducted a lottery in the preceding three months.  If there is a fashion show, therefore, and the organiser wishes to hold a lottery to raise a few more euro, this is how it will be done.  Until now, by law, the organiser should have had a permit for that, although many organisers would not have had one.  Now, there can be a lottery at a fashion show, table quiz or whatever it is, and the organiser will not need a permit, which will alleviate the issue and make it easier for clubs and organisations to hold fundraising events.  For payouts up to &euro;5,000, there will be no change and no matrix will be involved.  The vast majority of clubs and organisations that run bingo events are in that space, and we will not do anything to them.<\/p>  <p>  For larger prizes of between &euro;5,000 and &euro;30,000, that is serious money and the organiser must go to the District Court to seek a licence to operate at that level.  For the permit and the courts, the judge and the Garda superintendent have to ensure that the person applying for the permit or licence is of good repute, according to the legislation.  A licence to run a lottery will be given by the court and the payout can be up to &euro;30,000 per week.  The law states - we will not change it - that if such a permit is sought, it has to be for a charitable or philanthropic purpose.  No commercial bingo is currently allowed under law and we do not propose to entertain it.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the 1956 Act does not specify how much money, if anything, should go to charity.  If somebody goes to the court and applies for a licence to run bingo or a lottery, he or she has to name the charity that will receive the money but does not have to say how much it will receive.  The Bill will provide that the charity must receive at least 25% of the proceeds, which many Deputies support.  The vast majority of bingo events in towns, cities and rural areas will not be impacted by the provision because they are small potatoes compared with the larger events.  At present, operators at that level can put up to 40% of the proceeds into their back pocket, which leaves 60% for prizes.  We argue that 25% should be for the charity.  The figure allowed to be taken for running costs will be reduced from 40% to 25%, which will leave 50% for prizes.  In effect, we will reduce the prize fund from 60% to 50% of the take on the night, assuming the charity will receive little.  Nothing will prevent an organisation at any level from topping up the jackpot if it wishes, as some colleagues noted.  They indicated that, sometimes, organisers pay out 120% or 130% of the takings, perhaps because they have had a slow night.  Nothing will prevent that from happening and many clubs and organisations do it already.  I take Deputy Kenny's point but there is no reason to amend the legislation because organisers can top up the prize to make it more attractive.<\/p> <p>I understand it.  There is no need to change the Bill as it stands because of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400053#GGG00900","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575485700,"counter":707,"content":"<p>They can pay more than 50% if they want to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400054#HHH00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1575485700,"counter":708,"content":"<p>No, not 50%.

We are discussing amendments Nos. 5, 9, 10, 12 and 13.  We are making it easier for small bingo operators to operate because instead of having to print the name of the charity and prize on every book they will be able to put the information beside the door.  That makes everything much easier for them.  We are trying to make it easier across the board for small local operators.  Large so-called commercial operators have applied for licences and have told courts they are holding events on behalf of charities.  We are now telling them that they have to give 25% of the take to charity.  Most colleagues here have agreed on that.  That is the crux of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  A question was asked about rollovers.  Some clubs get a permit from Garda superintendents, which allows them to have a prize of &euro;5,000.  If the rollover goes beyond that, they should get a licence because they are going beyond the limit of the permit.  Deputy Byrne said many clubs have a cap of &euro;5,000.  They can then apply for a new permit for a new event.  I am delighted that most colleagues here have read about this, taken in the information and realised what is happening.  The main regulator is to be established.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned about addiction, which has been mentioned.  People who have an addiction of any sort need help, treatment, counselling and so forth.  It is a health issue, as I have said time and again.  We can do so much with regulation, but even where there is intense regulation in other jurisdictions, people still have addiction problems, there is problem gambling and so forth.  People with addiction problems of any kind, whether it is alcohol, drugs or anything else, need to be treated by the HSE and medical professionals.  This is something similar. <\/p>  <p>  We have to be careful to recognise that regulation will not solve addiction.  It can help, but it will not solve the problem.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire made a good point.  I recall the debate on Committee Stage with respect to lines and stakes, which we will discuss later.  I listened carefully and reduced the numbers involved.  People who have an addiction problem will spend and spend anyway.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill has been kicking around for two years.  It is only at one minute to midnight that this issue has been raised.  Unfortunately, I was out of the country when it arose and I want to apologise for any confusion that was caused.  There is no confusion intended.

I am in favour of increasing the amount that goes to charity to 25%, a change that makes all the sense in the world.  I still do not quite understand why a maximum of 50% of the proceeds is to go to those who play bingo.  A maximum is proposed, but if the running costs can be met with 5% of the money involved why can 70% of the proceeds not go back to the players?  This would mean 25% would still go to charity and running costs can be taken out of the remaining 5%.  If the amount can be topped up, why is the maximum not higher?  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify that.<\/p><p>When we are tackling this issue, it is important to distinguish between two different interest groups.  One is the interests of those who play bingo and use it as an important community outlet.  I am on their side and against anything that will impact on their ability to play bingo.  The second issue involves a separate group of interests, namely, the large bingo companies.  I accept that most of the bingo operators outside of the major cities do not exceed the &euro;5,000 limit.  Major corporations in Dublin have the money to hire PR companies and so on and have a separate interest to that of the players, namely, to minimise the amount that goes to charity and, therefore, to maximise their profits.  We clearly have to take a stand against that.  <\/p><p>On the broader issue, the Minister of State said that if someone has a gambling problem, he or she will spend and spend, and I take that point.  The Government has reduced the figure which can be spent from &euro;10 to &euro;5, but that facilitates gambling.  If there is a maximum bet per game of &euro;5, which is 800 times the previous limit, multiple games can be played at one point in time, as a previous speaker said.  A person could play five games a minute and play for an hour.  In the course of an hour, he or she could spend &euro;1,500.  People with addiction problems can spend a large amount very quickly and go broke.  <\/p><p>What the Minister of State proposes is wrong.  I agree that &euro;5 is better than &euro;10, but I do not think the &euro;5 limit is the answer.  That is particularly true given that we have the highest gross gambling revenue <i>per capita<\/i>in Europe.  We have up to 40,000 problem gamblers, yet we have no dedicated gambling addiction treatment service or gambling prevalence study, and there is no State agency dedicated to reducing gambling-related harm.  This issue is being significantly underestimated and is not being tackled by the Government.  <\/p><p>We have spoken about an element of the interests that exist within gambling, and there are much more significant interests at play than the average bingo company.  They are making substantial profits in this country.  We should not facilitate the exploitation of people who have addiction problems in the context of increased alienation, community fragmentation, poor mental health and the lack of Government investment in supports for people, which are, in some cases, being filled with addiction problems, including gambling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400054#HHH01100","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1575485700,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for allowing the Bill to be recommitted.  I respect that he was out of the country and it was difficult to catch up with what was going on when he got back.  Clarity on the issue was definitely required because a lot of people were concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Byrne's comments were not helpful.  He talked about lobby groups.  We can make up our own minds and do not need any lobby groups to tell us what to do.  I will talk on behalf of the constituents of Cork South-West and if he wants to talk on behalf of lobbyists, that is his own business.  If he had spoken to his constituents, he would have known how concerned they were about the Bill.  Many concerns required clarity.<\/p> <p>I respect that.  People are talking about prize money being printed on every ticket or for every bingo.  Perhaps I stand to be corrected, but I am pretty sure that when there is a pop-up bingo in a local social centre, a game that does not occur on a regular basis and that is based on the local hospital or whatever, it would depend on the number of people there.  Many of these groups make no money on the bingo, they basically make money on selling raffle tickets during bingo.  That is what keeps the doors open in community halls.  In fairness, the Minister of State has clarified quite a lot and I am not taking that away from him.  He has always been very fair in clarifying issues.<\/p> <p> Perhaps further clarity will be given.  I still think, however, that if a large bingo game is being run, perhaps to aid a community voluntary organisation, that the prize money going from 60% to 50% is going to upset many good bingo players.  There has also been much talk about addiction.  That is a serious problem, regardless of whether it is to addiction to alcohol or gambling.  However, we are going strongly down the route of bringing people playing a bit of bingo into that.  I am referring to people who play bingo once or twice a week.  That is getting mixed up in this conversation.<\/p> <p> Concerns have been expressed over the past number of days.  The Minister of State has allayed much of that concern.  If more clarification is needed, perhaps that can be given.  I appreciate that this Bill is being recommitted and that will give us a further opportunity to have a discussion.  Our job here is to try to help community and voluntary organisations.

I will not take that lecture from anyone in this House that we were eejits here and were lobbied by people and that we could not see who they were.  There is none so blind as those who cannot see at all.  We are well able to represent rural people and we are not going to be lobbied.<\/p>  <p>  We met professional lobbyists today and we were very quick to discern those from the ordinary people.  I have no truck with or interest in lining the pockets of public relations companies and allowing them to get paid.  They should not, and there is plenty of them around.  Plenty of them work for the political parties as well and plenty of mercenaries travel from party to party too.  As the whip of our group, I organised the meetings today through my office.  I want the allegation withdrawn that we were jumping on the bandwagon because of information we got from \"sharp-suited\" lobbyists.  Nothing could be further from the truth.

The only difference is that people there can get the DART, bus or Luas.  We cannot do that.  Often a husband would come to bingo and have a social drink while his wife or partner was playing bingo.  That day is gone now.  The wife might not be able to drive.  With the national car test, NCT, the poor roads, the b&oacute;ithre bochta, and everything else they cannot afford a car to drive.  Let those people have their pastime playing bingo and let the small voluntary clubs and groups be supported through the profits.  The spirit of it, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile, and the meitheal, is nearly quenched.  The late great Canon Hayes said that it is better to light one candle than to curse the dark.

Can those groups run their daily or weekly bingo on their permit and then, if the jackpot exceeds the &euro;5,000 combined with the amount given out in prize money, get a licence to cover that?  Will they be forced to continue to operate that licence when the prize money goes back again to less than &euro;5,000?<\/p> <p>Deputy Martin Kenny's suggestion that we increase the threshold from 50% to 75% meets the Minister of State's objective of giving 25% to charity.  None of us has an issue with that aspect of the Bill.  When we return to Committee Stage, Deputy Martin Kenny will propose that the maximum which can be paid out is 75%.  That will ensure the maximum amount of prize money is paid out.  If the operator wants to take a bigger share for itself, so be it.  In such circumstances, people will vote with their feet by going to another operator where the prize money is bigger.  The 25% that goes to the charity is secured in either event.<\/p> <p> My understanding, based on what the Minister of State has said, is that in circumstances in which the jackpot rolls over, the 75% cap we are proposing will not kick in.  As I understand it, the 75% cap will apply to the money taken at the door of the bingo hall on that particular day.  As Deputy Scanlon said earlier, the &euro;100 that is put into the jackpot every week rolls over if the jackpot is not won.  Such roll-over moneys cannot be seen as takings on the door or considered as part of the prize pool or pot.  The Minister of State referred earlier to an operator taking money that it already has on account.<\/p> <p> I would like clarity on the licence.  It appears that if a community group falls back under the &euro;5,000 threshold, it will revert to operating under its permit.  If the Minister of State accepts Deputy Martin Kenny's proposal to increase the prize money cap from 50% to 75%, that will address the issue which has been raised with me by community groups across my local area.

It is inevitable that those who will be responsible for administering this legislation will end up worried.  They are volunteers rather than professional accountants.  They do not own these businesses.  They are setting out to do something for the good of their communities.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention something the Minister of State should consider.  I do not disagree with him when he says a certain amount of money should go to charity and that we should make it clear it is going to charity.  Why is he not expanding the role of the Charities Regulator to provide for some regulatory oversight?  I remind him that all of these community organisations have to fund their work.  I will give a small example of something the Government is doing at the moment which is giving rise to a great deal of fundraising.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is aware that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, is requiring significant fire surveys to be carried out in community buildings where there are cr&egrave;ches.  That is fine.  If one were to commission a fire survey tomorrow, it is likely it would cost thousands of euro.  The only way that many communities can raise such moneys is by organising a series of fundraising events, possibly including the kinds of events covered by this legislation.  Why is there no regulator to which people can go to get clarity?  I invite the Minister of State to go to his local Garda station to work out the finer points of the law in this area, including the stage at which roll-over and accumulator jackpots fall into certain categories.  I remind him that many garda&iacute; in many stations are under pressure.  It is difficult to work out these things.  The Minister of State is asking many people who are essentially volunteers to add another element to their existing burden, which involves seeking to do a good job for their local communities in a variety of community organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to put a second point to the Minister of State.

The Minister of State will recall that earlier I referenced what is known as \"bingo week\".  It is held in County Mayo in the spring and in the autumn.  Can anybody here tell me what is wrong with attending a monster bingo event, which people often do on a week's holiday?  It is akin to another person going to Cheltenham or the Galway races.

I do not see why we should give the impression that, as legislators, we are out to get at the monster bingo events.  There are thousands of people who adore monster events such as bingo week and the type of event I attended in the INEC in The Gleneagle Hotel in Killarney four or five weeks ago, which was great.  There is nothing wrong with that.  While there are many aspects of this legislation that are fine, the Minister of State needs to amend it to exempt bingo operations.  When I put that proposal to the Minister of State earlier he shook his head as if to indicate he could not do it.

It might have been better if he had started off with the heavy stuff such as the element of gambling that is problematic and causing huge social problems, particularly within families.  It would have been better if he had done that.  That would entail having a proper regulator and the introduction of other limits.<\/p> <p>The really problematic side of gambling is online, in the main, and in the privacy of people's homes where they can get rid of thousands of euro in a very short space of time with no checks and balances.  There is no positive side to that whatever.  It is a pity the Minister of State has not taken on that aspect of gaming and gambling.  Had he set about doing that, he would have had the support of the House.  <\/p> <p> There is a lack of understanding in this regard - I do not know where it is coming from, perhaps from the Department - on the distinction between the different kinds of bingo.  Some of it is charitable and some commercial but the fact that it has been operating on a non-charitable basis does not make it bad.  It is a commercial operation that provides a social outlet for people who are happy to buy their few books and go along a few nights a week.  It is a good social outlet for lots of people.  There is an element of taking one's chance and so on but it is predominantly social.  There has been a complete failure to appreciate the distinction between commercial bingo and charitable bingo for fundraising purposes, which operates on a smaller scale and what the Minister of State is doing to control the latter sounds quite reasonable.  What he is not legislating for and what he does not seem to have taken into consideration is commercial bingo, which is a very big activity in the Dublin area.  It operates throughout my constituency and many others, and I am sure that is also the case in other large population centres.  That he has not made that distinction is the problem and he needs to do that.  The Minister of State has stated that no commercial bingo is allowed in this country but why is that the case?  There is commercial bingo in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK.  I am not saying these operations are in any way philanthropic; they are not.  It is a commercial activity and it is legitimate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400057#LLL01200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575488100,"counter":759,"content":"<p>It is big business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400058#MMM00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1575488100,"counter":760,"content":"<p>Yes, it is a business but it is an entertainment business without too many downsides to it.

I am not aware that the Minister of State was seeking to take a contribution for charity from any other commercial entertainment activity or business but if he wants to do that, he should do so in a reasonable way.  Can he tell me another commercial activity where the Government came along and said it was taking 25% of its proceeds to go to charity?  I do not think that he would do that in any other area.  The problem is that there is not adequate legislation to define what bingo is, other than in respect of charitable and fundraising activities.  There is a separate commercial activity but the law does not recognise the reality of that.  The Minister of State would have been better off had he made that distinction between the two very different kinds of bingo, which is where the problem arises.  What effort was made to look at how the issue is dealt with elsewhere, particularly across the Border and across the water?  We would not be in this difficulty had he done so.

Most of those who go to these bingo halls, most of whom are elderly, do so to go out.  I do not consider it a form of gambling; I just see it as a form of entertainment for most of them.  My mother is not well but she used to do it.<\/p>  <p>  I seek clarity on the figure of &euro;5,000 per week.  My local soccer club holds a draw, which goes up to &euro;8,000 and &euro;10,000.  Is the &euro;5,000 weekly, that is, it would not affect the draw if the &euro;8,000 was carrying over?<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny suggested a possible change to the effect that the 50% would be taken up to 75%.  That might solve some of the problems people have raised in respect of prizes.  I agree with others on the amount going to charity.  From what I can gather, very little was going to charity and while I accept some should, I am not sure that it should be 25%.  I seek an answer to this issue because this has been an ongoing practice.<\/p>  <p>  Will some of the bigger companies argue that they have been employing many people and if the legislation reduces their margins, they will cut back on staff?

I assume the plan is to ban them completely.  I have not heard of what will happen on this.  Some of these halls do not make a lot of money and while it is gambling, many of the people who use them do not go out very much.

Incidentally, the Bill allows the Minister of the day to amend those figures.  It will not need primary legislation, which was one of the issues with the 1956 Act.  They got stuck in time and there was no way of changing but we have included a section in this Bill that will enable the Minister of the day to change some of these figures by regulation if necessary.  It would have to come before the House to be approved but if there is a problem that has not been foreseen that can be done, although that is not possible in respect of the percentages.  The figures of &euro;5,000, &euro;30,000 and the stake in prizes for the machine can be amended by statutory instrument with the approval of the House, if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that under current law, commercial bingo is not allowed.  If someone goes to the courts because he or she wants to run bingo or a lottery - and bingo has been identified in the courts as a lottery - he or she must do it for a charity.  That is the law as it stands and most colleagues here agree with that.  The big issue causing a problem here is the percentage  the charity should get.  I have suggested 25% and that 25% of the takings would go to run the thing, which is quite a large amount of money.  While getting 25% of the takings is a lot of money; at present those concerned are taking up to 40%, which is huge, and then there would be 50% for the prizes.  At the moment, prizes comprise approximately 60% although I know we have spoken about 75% and so on.  There is a facility to top up.  <\/p>  <p>  There were a few questions about roll-overs.  At the moment, and this will not change, if a prize goes over &euro;5,000, one needs to get a licence from the court because one is running an event for which a licence from the court is clearly demanded and that is it.  That is clear.<\/p>  <p>The lottery licence lasts for 12 months, as per the legislation.

Depending on how the machines are structured, we will have people doing what happens on these types of machines in other jurisdictions.  They will not play for one &euro;5 stake and one &euro;500 prize.  They could be playing for ten &euro;5 stakes and ten &euro;500 prizes.  This is an incredible incentive to engage in mad gambling with a view of winning for a problem gambler.  Gamblers do not necessarily have the outlook the Minister of State has on gambling.  A person might well envisage if he or she were to spend an hour or two on one of these machines not only would he or she win a &euro;500 prize but he or she could win ten &euro;500 prizes.  When people are caught up in mad gambling, that is the way they think.  That is what is happening with online gambling.  I presume these figures are probably influenced by the fact that people can gamble away vast sums online.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State may have done this but if he has not, he should talk to some of the young people on GAA teams and other sports people who find themselves heavily addicted to gambling and to the notion of large prizes, which he is inserting here.  What he has put forward here is utterly and completely wrong and destructive.  <\/p>  <p>  When I was a Minister, I instituted the first study on gambling.  I have also had an opportunity to meet people in a number of organisations throughout the country who deal with gambling addictions and, for families, problem gambling is probably the worst addiction of all.  People will gamble away the house, farm, business and family savings.  We have no mechanisms to deal with problem gambling other than a small number of specialist facilities that will take people usually on the basis of them having private health insurance.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this proposal.  The Labour Party does not accept it.  The proposal could cause great harm to people with problem gambling issues and their families who often find their family home, everything they posses, their farm or business has gone because of the gambler.  Many young people in different sporting organisations have come out and explained what has happened regarding their problem gambling.  If the Minister of State were to speak to any of them, they would give him a different take on this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400060#OOO00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1575489300,"counter":797,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 6 is being discussed with amendment No. 7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400060#OOO00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1575489300,"counter":798,"content":"<p>I want to point out there are very few areas where stakes and prizes are controlled by legislation but this is one of them.

This particular area is the one area where we are legislating to control the amount that can be put on.  This has not been changed since 1956.  The current position is ludicrous in that the amount is so small, it is being ignored all over the place, as Deputy O'Callaghan said.  There is no scientific method for us to know which is the best thing to do.  We have also inserted in the legislation a provision whereby a Minister in the future can reduce or increases these amounts by way of a statutory instrument in consultation with the Houses.  If the &euro;5 stake is too much and is seen to be a problem, the Minister of the day can bring in a statutory instrument and change it swiftly without having to resort to primary legislation.  The same applies to stakes or prizes.  I believe that is a good provision.<\/p>  <p>  We had a good debate on this on Committee Stage.  I listened carefully to what colleagues had to say and to what Senators had to say when we debated the Bill in the Seanad.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, this is a good compromise.  However, if it proves to be unworkable or if causes an issue further down the road, it will be easy for the Minister of the day to change it quickly without too much fuss and without having to go through what we are doing here.<\/p>  <p>  We propose revised amounts of a maximum stake of &euro;5 and a maximum prize of &euro;500.  It is not compulsory or even expected that somebody would do that.  It may not please everybody but there is little point in putting in amounts so small that they will be ignored and, therefore, this is what we propose.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Bruton rightly said, it is not clear that physical gaming machines will be a significant feature in the future.  Gaming can just as easily be done online or on a mobile device.  The regulator, who will be established before too long, will have to take on board the issue of mobile online gambling, which is becoming much more of a serious issue.  I recognise that, as others do.<\/p>  <p>  I also recognise a small number of people, regardless of what amounts we might set for gambling machines, will be vulnerable to addictive behaviour and the temptation to play quickly but we are not in a position to impose technical requirements in respect of gaming machines at this time.  Any such technical requirements will have to await consideration in our proposed comprehensive reform of gambling licensing and regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400060#OOO01100","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1575489300,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Is the amendment agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400060#OOO01200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1575489300,"counter":804,"content":"<p>It is not agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400060#OOO01300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575489300,"counter":805,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1575489300,"counter":806,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 8, line 26, to delete &ldquo;&euro;750&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&euro;500&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400060#OOO01500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575489300,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1575489300,"counter":808,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 8 is a drafting amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400060#OOO01700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1575489300,"counter":809,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 27, to delete &ldquo;product concerned.&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;product concerned (if such is required) and there is no additional charge for the redemption of a prize.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>This amendment proposes a minor addition to the wording of the new section 27A(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the principal Act inserted by section 10 of the Bill.

It was the Minister of State who decided to take Report Stage tonight.  As I have said before, the reason that there are ten Stages to passing legislation is to allow for consideration of Bills.  This issue was only flagged with us in the last 24 to 48 hours.  We are putting forward what we believe is a constructive solution to this issue which protects the integrity of the Bill, which aims to ensure that 25% of takings go to charities.  Our amendment facilitates that.  Rather than dividing the House on this issue, I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400061#PPP02900","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1575489900,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I raised this issue with the Taoiseach earlier today and he made it clear that his interest and the interest of the Government is in the 25% for charity.  The Minister of State has obtained the agreement of the House for that but he is imposing these rules without knowing how costs are structured in this business, whether games are run by voluntary organisations, semi-professional organisations, or professional organisations.  He is tying a noose around his own neck because, in a commercial operation, hiring a hall, advertising a game, and employing staff might easily run to a significant percentage of takings whereas if it was an entirely voluntary local thing, those costs may be far lower because people are giving their services voluntarily.  The Minister of State is not trying to ban the semi-commercial lotteries which people outside the gate were talking about yesterday but, if he wants his 25% for charity, he should stick with that.<\/p> <p>If needs be, why not commission a study of profit margins and earnings in the industry so that the Minister of State and his officials actually know what they are talking about and can tell us the sensible thing to do?  The Minister of State has no basis for his figures of 25%, 25% and 50%, or 40% and 35%.

This provision is irrelevant to the legislation the Minister of State is bringing forward.  We are considering the takings of a lottery or a bingo in one week.  We are saying that 25% of those takings should go to charity.  We are saying it should be up to whatever person, organisation or company is running the bingo game to decide how much of the remaining 75% to put into the prize fund and how much to keep for themselves or spend on running the business.  The operator may have a good week when it needs to use less than 50% for prize money.  There may be a week when there is a small crowd at the bingo hall and the operator needs to put 75% into the prize money.  This provision would give operators the flexibility to do that.  By giving them that flexibility, the Minister of State would be allowing operators to top up the prize fund from their own money, just as he has described.  However, this would put that choice in the legislation rather than just suggesting it as an alternative.  We need to be explicit about what people can do and be explicit in giving them flexibility.  That is what we are asking for.  I appeal to the Minister of State because I know he is a reasonable person.  We all want to do the right thing here.  The reasonable approach is to accept this small amendment and then we can move forward together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400062#QQQ00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1575490500,"counter":849,"content":"<p>It is not for me to interfere, but could I suggest that we find a compromise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019120400062#QQQ00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1575490500,"counter":850,"content":"<p>We have one.

We have not had a huge amount of time to consider this.  The only issue I can see is that we are dealing with conditions that will apply to a lottery licence granted by the District Court.  These conditions will apply in cases where the prizes are between &euro;5,000 and &euro;30,000 a week.  These are the large-scale bingo events Deputy Michael Healy-Rae was talking about earlier.<\/p><p>I understand the point made by Deputy Naughten.  The 25% referred to in paragraph (<i>d<\/i>) of the conditions is not incompatible with the figures of 75% and 25% in paragraph (<i>e<\/i>).  I know it can be read intelligently, but it is a bit odd for two paragraphs to have a total percentage adding up to 125%.  I know it can be read in a sensible way.  However, if the Minister of State is happy to go with it I will go along with it.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say.  A lot of these big bingo events are run by operators.  There is no doubt about that.  The Minister of State has told us they get 40%.  That sounds like far too much to me.

We are interested in ensuring that charities get a fair share.  We are all agreed on the 25% figure.

There seems to be consensus across the House that this is the right thing to do.  We have argued the toss here.  We do not have an awful lot of time, but I do not wish to divide the House.  This should help larger community organisations that surpass the &euro;5,000 mark and meet running costs from their own bank account anyway.  Rather than having to top prize money up from their funds, they can use this provision if they wish.  With that in mind I am persuaded by colleagues, including Independents as well as Members from the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il.
