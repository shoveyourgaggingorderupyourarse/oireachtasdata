Through consultation with the Oireachtas All-party Working Group on Commemorations and the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, I have sought to prioritise projects that are of educational and historical value, that provide a lasting legacy and that are appropriate in tone and scale to the events being commemorated. <\/p><p>To date, a number of capital projects have been identified as priorities in this regard for completion by Easter 2016. These include the development of a suitable permanent facility for the Military Service Pensions Archive, the renovation of Kilmainham Courthouse to enhance the visitor experience at Kilmainham Gaol, the development of a permanent exhibition space and interpretive centre at the GPO, and the development of visitor facilities at Teach an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc. Among the further projects under active consideration are developments at the National Archives and the National Concert Hall, as well as the renovation of Richmond Barracks and the development of a Tenement Museum.  The progress of these and other initiatives will be contingent, inter alia, on the availability of resources. <\/p><p>In relation to the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, in July 2013 I made a determination under the National Monuments Acts on the consent application and related Environmental Impact Statement submitted by the owners in relation to their proposals for the national monument.  My decision provided, inter alia, for the full repair and restoration of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and the creation of a commemorative centre to honour the leaders of the 1916 Rising. The completed designs for the approved works have now been submitted to my Department to verify that they are in compliance with the decision I made on the consent application in July 2013. The National Asset Management Agency has recently confirmed to my Department that it will make the necessary funding available for the works covered by my consent.  This adds considerably to the prospects of a fitting tribute to the 1916 leaders being in place in Moore Street in time for the centenary of the Rising.<\/p><p>Complementing the many special presentations, reports and discussions prepared by the national cultural institutions, colleges and community groups, the centenaries this year of the founding of Cumann na mBan and the import of arms by the Irish Volunteers are being marked by official ceremonies.  The arrangements for Cumann na mBan included a commemoration led by the President at Glasnevin and an academic conference hosted by the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks.  The import of arms in July 1914 will be marked by special presentations in the Asgard Gallery at Collins Barracks and a special programme at Howth harbour.  A second online release of historic records from the Military Service Pensions Archive will support research and enhance our understanding of the republican movement.  The continuous reporting and analysis of centenary news by <i>Century Ireland<\/i>will offer a sense of the period to interested readers.<\/p><p>The programme to commemorate the First World War is developing. In partnership with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Teresa Villiers, I laid the foundation stone for a memorial cross at Glasnevin Cemetery on 31 March last.  This 'Cross of Sacrifice' was arranged in partnership between Glasnevin Trust and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The dedication of the Cross will take place in late July in remembrance of all the soldiers from Ireland who died in the Great War.  A special Cathedral Service of Remembrance on 3 August will mark the entry into the war and be followed closely by further events in Britain and Europe in early August.  The First World War centenary programme will continue on the historic timeline until 2018, marking the salient anniversaries of particular significance for Ireland.<\/p><p>Information on the developing commemorative programme will be available on my Department's website and individual announcements will issue for specific events. I remain, as always, grateful to hear from Deputies with any views on commemorative arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700046#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Criteria","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700046#WRA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[17782\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700046#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the position regarding special areas of conservation on which turf cutting is still taking place.","asker":"981","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>I published three major documents relating to Ireland's peatlands in January.

This is a difficult reality that every publicly funded body has had to deal with during the economic crisis. I can assure the House that I have done my utmost to minimize budget cuts to the cultural institutions, in so far as was possible, while being cognisant of competing demands on the public finances. The stark reality is that, in the current funding environment, institutions have had to make difficult choices when prioritising the spending of their allocations.<\/p><p>In relation to the National Archives, the Bishop Street headquarters are at capacity and off-site storage has been required for a number of years to house the statutory annual transfer of Departmental records to the National Archives.  Cognisant of these matters, my Department had requested that the OPW prepare a development plan for the Bishop Street premises. A plan was prepared accordingly for the phased delivery of the necessary works in the National Archives headquarters warehouse. The plan concluded that the construction of a two storey facility <i>within<\/i>the existing building will provide an efficient and economically viable solution to the storage needs of the National Archives.  A formal Cost Benefit Analysis in respect of the proposed development was completed in October 2013.

Ireland is committed to defending the universality of human rights, and one of our key priorities is the promotion and protection of space for civil society to operate, free from harassment and intimidation.  Civil society actors have come under increasing pressure in many parts of the world in recent years. In some countries, dialogue with civil society remains limited, and the space for civil society engagement is narrow or shrinking. Restrictive legislation and repressive practices in some countries have led to stigmatisation, harassment, and even criminalisation of civil society actors. As part of our commitment to the protection of civil society space, Ireland took the lead, with the support of a cross-regional group of member states consisting of Chile, Japan, Sierra Leone, and Tunisia, on a new draft resolution entitled &lsquo;Civil society space; creating and maintaining, in law and in practice a safe and enabling environment&rsquo; at the 24th session of the Human Rights Council which took place in September 2013.<\/p><p>  The creation and maintenance of space for civil society is inextricably linked to the ability of individuals to exercise their fundamental right to the freedoms of peaceful assembly, association, opinion and expression.  This resolution addresses, for the first time at the Human Rights Council, the issue of civil society space as a human rights concern, underlining the importance of the contribution of civil society in so many aspects of our lives, and calling on States to create and maintain, in law and practice, a safe and enabling environment in which civil society can operate effectively.  The draft resolution was the subject of difficult and politically sensitive negotiations.  Ireland successfully defended the draft resolution against several hostile amendments, paving the way for it to be adopted by the Council without a vote.<\/p><p>  On foot of the resolution, a panel discussion was held on 11 March 2014 during the 25th  session of the Human Rights Council, on the challenges facing states in their efforts to ensure space for civil society, and lessons learnt and good practices in this regard.  The Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva worked closely with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the preparations for this event.<\/p><p>  The panel discussion was addressed via video message by the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon.  Ms Flavia Pansieri, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, also delivered opening remarks, which was followed by an interactive discussion moderated by Ms. Hina Jilani, a prominent human rights lawyer and pro-democracy campaigner. The panellists were: Ms. Safak Pavey, member of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; Mr. Frank La Rue, Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression; Ms. Deeyah Khan, film, music and arts producer; and Mr. Mokhtar Trifi, Honorary President, Tunisian League for Human Rights.<\/p><p>  In addition to the panellists, many states, national human rights institutions, non-governmental organisations, and UN agencies intervened during the discussion to highlight their diverse experiences in the promotion and protection of civil society space.<\/p><p>  Ireland delivered a national statement during the interactive debate which emphasised that protecting civil society space entails the fulfilment of the rights of peaceful assembly, association, opinion and expression, online and offline, which in turn facilitate the enjoyment of other human rights.  It is the primary responsibility of states to promote and protect these rights and to be accountable to their citizens.  The statement also noted that governments should see civil society as an asset, not a threat.  It expressed deep concern that in some countries, certain provisions, such as those relating to national security, public morals, defamation, funding and regulation of the internet, have led to the harassment, stigmatisation and criminalisation of civil society actors.   <\/p><p>  The statement also emphasised that ethical, religious or cultural values should not be used as a justification for putting in place national legislation which undermines the universality of human rights, and that national legislation should be consistent with international human rights law and should facilitate civil society to operate in a safe and enabling environment.  Ireland also highlighted that the engagement and inclusive participation of civil society can cultivate democracy, enhance the promotion and protection of human rights, prevent violations and abuses, and foster social and economic development.<\/p><p>  As mandated by the resolution on civil society space, OHCHR will now prepare a summary report of the panel discussion which will be presented to the Human Rights Council at its 27th  session in September 2014.  Building on this report, Ireland intends to work with its partners to lead a further resolution on civil society space at the Human Rights Council.   We will also continue, through our development cooperation programme, to use our voice, influence and partnerships to protect and promote the ability of civil society organisations to operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[18444\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had any recent discussions with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State in relation to the proposed Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[18451\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his proposals to discuss further with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive the need to establish a civic forum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[18521\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the recent discussions he has had with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State or with Members of the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to the Irish Language Act; the progress made in relation to this legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 44 and 52 together.<\/p><p>I believe that the Good Friday and St Andrew&rsquo;s Agreements provide the essential framework for the achievement of reconciliation and mutual trust in Northern Ireland and in the totality of relations between these islands.

At that meeting, the European Union expressed its deep concern about the ongoing conflict in South Sudan and the grave human suffering it is causing for ordinary civilians caught up in the violence.<\/p><p>  Since the outbreak of the conflict in mid-December 2013, more than one million people have been forced from their homes and around 3.7 million people are severely food insecure. At the Foreign Affairs Council, the EU welcomed the role of the UN in coordinating the humanitarian response and urged all partners to contribute both generously and swiftly to the South Sudan Crisis Response Plan. In particular, the EU urged the international community to align efforts in addressing the growing food security problem while at the same time strengthening the resilience of the population. EU Foreign Ministers also condemned continued restrictions on humanitarian activities and called on all parties to allow rapid, full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all populations in need, in accordance with international humanitarian law and principles.<\/p><p>  Total EU (Commission and Member State) humanitarian support currently stands at &euro;127 million. This funding is supporting immediate life-saving activities such as distributing essential food and non-food items, providing shelter, healthcare, protection, water, hygiene and sanitation. Funding is targeted at people in need within South Sudan, as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries. <\/p><p>  Ireland has committed more than &euro;3.6 million to date in 2014 in response to the current outbreak of conflict and resulting displacement.  In January, I authorised two airlifts totalling 45 tonnes of emergency supplies to South Sudan from our pre-positioned stocks in Accra, Ghana, valued at &euro;400,000. A further airlift of 36 tonnes of emergency supplies, valued at &euro;370,000 was dispatched to Uganda in March to assist the South Sudanese refugees in the country. I also approved &euro;1.5 million in funding to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) for 2014 to ensure that UN agencies and NGOs on the ground can respond to urgent humanitarian needs. Finally, under Irish Aid NGO humanitarian funding schemes, I have so far in 2014 also approved a total of &euro;1,360,000 in funding to Concern, MSF, World Vision and Plan, for a range of emergency response activities in Unity, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Warrap States. <\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort both within South Sudan and for South Sudanese refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries.

Before addressing this in detail however, I would like to briefly outline the discussions that took place on other key issues.<\/p><p>  Opening the Council meeting with short introductory remarks, High Representative Ashton updated Ministers on: the latest developments in the Middle East Peace Process; her recent visit to Egypt; the latest round of nuclear talks with Iran; preparations for the elections in Iraq as well as the recent first round of Presidential elections in Afghanistan. She also noted the outcome of several high-level exchanges that had taken place in Brussels in recent weeks, notably the EU-US energy Council, the EU-US Summit, the EU-Africa Summit and the visit of the Chinese President. <\/p><p>  In the lunchtime discussions, Ministers had an exchange of views on Syria and Bosnia-Herzegovina; Council Conclusions were adopted in both areas. <\/p><p>  On Syria, the EU&rsquo;s emphasis remains on the importance of supporting Special Envoy Brahimi and the so-called &lsquo;Geneva II&rsquo; political talks process and on addressing the humanitarian crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries. The scale of the humanitarian challenge was underlined by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's recent report on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2139, which noted little evidence of meaningful progress on the ground in delivering humanitarian assistance since the adoption of UN Resolution 2139. <\/p><p>  The discussion on Bosnia-Herzegovina was wide-ranging. The EU&rsquo;s efforts are firmly focussed on supporting Bosnia in its efforts to meet the accession criteria; Ireland remains a strong supporter of Bosnia&rsquo;s EU perspective. <\/p><p>  In the afternoon, we moved on to a detailed discussion of the crisis in Ukraine and for the latter part of the exchange, we were joined by Commissioner Oettinger who briefed the Council on exchanges that day with Energy Ministers, on the critically important energy dossier.  <\/p><p>  Ministers decided to expand the list of those to whom visa bans and asset freezes will apply. Preparatory work continues on so-called Phase Three measures so that further steps can be taken should they be required. Ministers also agreed to send an expert mission to Ukraine to prepare possible EU assistance in support of reform and capacity-building in the areas of policing and rule-of-law.<\/p><p>  The FAC also adopted a Decision on macro-financial assistance for Ukraine, which brings the total amount of funding being made available by the EU to &euro;1.6 billion.  The support is part of a broader package of international support put together by the IMF and conditioned on Ukraine's implementation of wide-ranging reforms.<\/p><p>  The EU will also continue its engagement in international facilitation initiatives involving the UN, the OSCE and others.  Ireland is participating fully in these efforts: we contributed officers to two interim OSCE observer missions pending the deployment of the main OSCE Monitoring Mission which is being put in place and in which Irish personnel will also take part. <\/p><p>  The FAC expressed strong support for the holding of free and fair presidential elections on 25 May.  Ireland is sending a number of observers to Ukraine to help achieve that objective, one which will allow the Ukrainian people to determine their own future and help build trust across the country.  It is in the interest of the entire region that a sovereign, prosperous, stable, democratic and inclusive Ukraine emerges from the current crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dublin-Monaghan Bombings","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[18447\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he raised last week in his discussions with the British Foreign Secretary the need for the British Government to respond positively and without further delay to the motions passed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann requesting the British Government to release the papers and-or files pertaining to the Dublin\/Monaghan bombings in 1974; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I applaud that &ndash; and urge them to recognise the opportunity that is now in sight and to take it.<\/p><p>  We witnessed last year how some are only too willing to decry and reject politics altogether or take politics into their own hands and out onto the streets.  Those individuals and groups must be given the clearest message that progress is made only through dialogue and negotiation by those elected to lead.  Those political leaders can count on the full support of this government as they work through the talks process to reach a comprehensive agreement. <\/p><p>  The Government wants to see an early agreement as we believe it is in the best interests of Northern Ireland and I will continue to engage closely with the British Government and the NI parties over the coming weeks towards that end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC01925"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[18455\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the failure of the international community to provide adequate humanitarian aid to Syria and that region was discussed at the recent EU Foreign Affairs Council, if he will outline the commitments made by the international community following the Humanitarian Aid Pledging Conference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>The protracted and tragic crisis in Syria has resulted in unprecedented levels of humanitarian need, requiring a sustained response from the international community. As the number of fatalities surpasses an estimated 140,000 people, there are now over 9 million people within Syria who are in need of immediate life-saving support, with a further 2.6 million Syrian refugees requiring assistance in neighbouring countries.  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of a further &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance at the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and region in Kuwait on January 15th 2014. This additional pledge in Kuwait brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding commitment over the period 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million, of which over &euro;20 million has been disbursed to date. Funds have been provided to a range of established UN partners as well as to Irish NGOs.  We will continue to provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.<\/p><p>  Ireland has also been consistent in its efforts to ensure that the necessary attention is given by the international community to this crisis, including at the most recent meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg. At this meeting discussions were focussed on the need for a political solution to the conflict which has had dire humanitarian consequences, both within Syria and in its neighbouring countries. Ministers considered the latest developments on the ground, in particular the state of play in diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the crisis and the implementation of the UN Security Resolution 2139, on humanitarian access.<\/p><p>  The revised UN response plan for Syria and the refugee populations has requested US$6.5 billion dollars in total for operations in 2014, of which approximately 23% has been provided by the international community to date. This represents the largest humanitarian appeal in the history of the UN. The international community has pledged US$2.5 billion in assistance in response. Ireland strongly supports the continuation of the EU&rsquo;s role as the largest donor to this prolonged crisis and has used every opportunity to encourage donors to honour their pledges towards the humanitarian response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700048#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700049#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[18456\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700049#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress made on the possibility of immigration reform legislation being passed by the United States Congress in 2014; the proposals, if any, he has to have further discussions with members of Congress and with members of the US Administration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>This is an issue to which I accord very high priority and I have maintained contact, both directly and through our Embassy in Washington, with many key players in Congress who are influential in steering the process of US immigration reform.   <\/p><p>  The Taoiseach discussed immigration reform and the plight of our undocumented in many of the meetings and public engagements during the recent St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Washington DC.

As regards the action being taken by the EU, I believe that throughout this crisis the Union&rsquo;s messages have been strong and they have been consistent and clear.  All Member States have been, and are, united in their views that what has happened in Ukraine is completely unacceptable and that it will have consequences for our relations with Russia.  From the outset, the EU has played an active role in trying to facilitate a resolution to the crisis in Ukraine.  In addition to its scheduled meetings, the Foreign Affairs Council has met twice in extraordinary session to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the Heads of State and Government also have discussed Ukraine in extraordinary session as well as during the regular meetings of the European Council.<\/p><p>  The Heads of State and Government on 6 March set out a three-phase roadmap in relation to targeted measures against the Russian Federation in the absence of steps to de-escalate the situation.  They also endorsed the decision of Foreign Ministers to suspend talks with Russia on visa matters and on a New Agreement, both stated priorities of the Russian Government.  Following the holding of the referendum in Crimea, the Foreign Affairs Council implemented the second phase of measures involving the imposition of travel restrictions and an asset freeze against 21 Russian and Ukrainian officials involved in undermining Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.<\/p><p>  On Monday of this week, I participated in the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg, where there was a detailed discussion of the crisis in Ukraine.  Ministers decided to expand the list of those to whom visa bans and asset freezes will apply. Preparatory work continues on so-called Phase Three measures so that further steps can be taken should they be required. Ministers also agreed to send an expert mission to Ukraine to prepare possible EU assistance in support of police and rule-of-law.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council also adopted a Decision on macro-financial assistance for Ukraine, which brings the total amount of funding being made available by the EU to &euro;1.6 billion.  The support is part of a broader package of international support put together by the IMF and conditioned on Ukraine's implementation of wide-ranging reforms<\/p><p>  The EU will also continue its engagement in international facilitation initiatives involving the UN, the OSCE and others.  Ireland is participating fully in these efforts: we sent one officer to the initial interim and  another to the subsequent Polish-led second interim OSCE missions. One Irish person has been seconded to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission agreed upon on 21 March and others are available should the mission be expanded as planned.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on Monday expressed strong support for the holding of free and fair presidential elections on 25 May.  Ireland is sending a team of observers to Ukraine to help achieve that objective, one which will allow the Ukrainian people to determine their own future and help build trust across the country.  It is in the interest of the entire region that a sovereign, prosperous, stable, democratic and inclusive Ukraine emerges from the current crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700049#WRD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":116,"content":"<p>Question No. 51 answered with Question No. 40.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":117,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700049#WRD00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Regulation","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700049#WRD00850"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[18257\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700049#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"with regard to the appointment of a person (details supplied) as an independent agent by the special liquidators to examine whether KPMG should be sued for its role in auditing INBS's books; if this person has been in receipt of any employ of fees from Irish Bank Resolution Corporation since the bank's liquidation; if his attention has been drawn to any work previously or ongoing by this person for KPMG; if he is satisfied with the independence of the special liquidator's appointment; if he provided any direction as to who should be appointed; and his views on whether a person from outside the State should have been appointed.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>Due to commercial confidentiality and sensitivities, and also client\/solicitor confidentiality, the Special Liquidators do not propose to provide details of whether there was\/are amounts payable by IBRC (in Special Liquidation) to the firm concerned.

Enforcement is an important tool to effect deterrence, achieve compliance and promote positive behaviour. The Central Bank\u00a0will take enforcement action against regulated entities under its Probability Risk Impact Supervisory System (PRISM) supervisory model. PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the Central Bank concluded 16 Administrative Sanctions Procedure (ASP) cases, imposing fines totalling &euro;6.35 million.\u00a0The cases involved firms across most of the Central Bank's areas of responsibility such as banking, insurance, investment firms, retail financial intermediaries and moneylenders. The breaches that arose related to issues such as breaches of prudential requirements (e.g. failure to maintain adequate solvency margins; failure to ensure accuracy of regulatory reporting to the Central Bank; failures in relation to systems and controls dealing with technical reserves), breaches of the Consumer Protection Code,\u00a0failure to comply with the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders and the failure by a listed company to comply with the requirements relating to the proper maintenance of an insiders' list.<\/p><p>  The total fines of &euro;6.35 million for 2013 includes a &euro;5 million fine imposed on Quinn Insurance Limited (Under Administration) that was waived due to the exceptional circumstances of the case, namely that the firm is under administration and is wholly reliant on funding from the Insurance Compensation Fund, which is ultimately funded by the public. The Central Bank has a policy of issuing detailed publicity statements following the conclusion of each ASP settlement.\u00a0Further details of each of the above cases is available on the Central Bank's website. <\/p><p>  In 2014 to date, I have been informed that the Central Bank has concluded 4 ASP cases, imposing fines totalling &euro;575,640. The cases dealt with issues including breaches of large exposure requirements, capital adequacy requirements, the Insurance Mediation Regulations and MiFID Regulations. Detailed publicity statements in relation to 3 of these cases are available on the Central Bank's website. With regard to the fourth, relating to a breach of professional indemnity insurance requirements, I have been informed by the Central Bank that this is one of a number of cases relating to a particular enforcement theme and a publicity statement relating to this case along with other cases dealing with the same enforcement theme will issue as a batch later in the year. This approach seeks to maximise the public impact of the enforcement work.<\/p><p>  I have been further informed by the Central Bank that its\u00a0Enforcement Division currently has 29 open ASP cases. These open cases cover the range of areas of the Central Bank's supervisory responsibility. The issues under investigation also broadly align with the Central Bank's public statement of its enforcement priorities, which was published on its website on 25 February 2014.<\/p><p>  The issues under investigation in the open ASP cases include compliance with prudential requirements by banks and insurance companies; compliance with the MiFID conduct of business rules by investment firms; compliance with the Consumer Protection Code and compliance with requirements to have adequate systems and controls in place. The open ASP cases also include investigations into historical lending practices at Irish Nationwide Building Society, financial irregularities at the former Bloxham Stockbrokers and issues related to Quinn Insurance Limited. <\/p><p>  The open cases also include a case relating to a possible breach of the Market Abuse Directive Regulations, which has been referred to a panel of Assessors under Regulation 35 of those Regulations. <\/p><p>  The open cases further include the Central Bank's investigations into Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (formerly Anglo Irish Bank) and Custom House Capital, both of which are currently suspended, following consultation with the Garda&iacute;, to avoid the risk of prejudicing any current or future criminal prosecutions.<\/p><p>  In addition, as set out in the Central Bank's Annual Performance Statement for 2012, 841 Regulatory Actions were taken in 2012.\u00a0The 2013 Annual Performance Statement\u00a0will be published in due course\u00a0by the Central Bank.

The advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland. A county by county panel with over 2000 participating accountants is in place and their details are available on . Borrowers are free to choose their own advisor from this panel and the lender will pay &euro;250 to the accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choice for the provision of this independent financial advice. <\/p><p>The Central Bank collates the information relating to the number of borrowers who have availed of the independent financial advice service on a quarterly basis commencing in Quarter 1 2013. The data supplied does not relate exactly to the reporting period as there will be delays between the time the lender makes the long-term resolution offer to the borrower, the meeting with the accountant and the receipt by the lender of the invoice. <\/p><p>A review of the independent financial advice element of the Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service was undertaken in 2013 to ensure that the service is meeting its objectives. A group comprising representatives from the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection was established to oversee the review. The review report has been considered by the Mortgage Arrears Implementation Steering Group and the Cabinet Committee on Mortgage Arrears and Credit Availability.<\/p><p>The key recommendations in the review report relate to increasing awareness among borrowers through the provision of clear and unambiguous information about the service and to increase the scope of the advice to include advice on the other mortgage debt resolution options that are now available for borrowers, so that they can fully assess their options. In that context the report recommends that consideration be given to increasing the funding for the financial advice from &euro;250 to &euro;500.<\/p><p>A stakeholder seminar was held in January 2014 to which all stakeholders were invited to discuss the recommendations of the review. An implementation plan has been prepared and discussions have commenced with the relevant stakeholders to progress the recommendations.  <\/p><p>It is envisaged that the service will continue to be funded by the lenders and that the recommended changes to the service will be in place by the end of Quarter 2 2014.<\/p><p>Usage details of the services are set out in the table below.<\/p><p><b>Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Helpline Calls<\/th><th><div>Visits to Keepingyourhome.ie<br \/><br \/>website <\/div><\/th><th><div>Financial Advice Service ( invoices received by lenders from accountants)<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>August 2012<\/td><td><div>295<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September 2012<\/td><td><div>397<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October 2012<\/td><td><div>459<\/div><\/td><td><div>*34,157<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November 2012<\/td><td><div>410<\/div><\/td><td><div>6,434<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2012<\/td><td><div>259<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,150<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>January 2013<\/td><td><div>577<\/div><\/td><td><div>9,955<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February 2013<\/td><td><div>529<\/div><\/td><td><div>10,073<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March 2013<\/td><td><div>737<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,243<\/div><\/td><td><div>54<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April 2013<\/td><td><div>973<\/div><\/td><td><div>17,813<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>May 2013<\/td><td><div>610<\/div><\/td><td><div>9,463<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>June 2013<\/td><td><div>504<\/div><\/td><td><div>10,194<\/div><\/td><td><div>52<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July 2013<\/td><td><div>473<\/div><\/td><td><div>9,632<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August 2013<\/td><td><div>590<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,621<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September 2013<\/td><td><div>521<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,438<\/div><\/td><td><div>72<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October 2013<\/td><td><div>641<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,815<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November 2013  <\/td><td><div>440<\/div><\/td><td><div>10,029<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2013<\/td><td><div>385<\/div><\/td><td><div>10,063<\/div><\/td><td><div>119<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>January 2014<\/td><td><div>665<\/div><\/td><td><div>10,387<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February 2014<\/td><td><div>749<\/div><\/td><td><div>12,239<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March 2014<\/td><td><div>608<\/div><\/td><td><div>11,817<\/div><\/td><td><div>**<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April 2014 (to end April 4th)<\/td><td><div>123<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,074<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td><div>10,945<\/div><\/td><td><div>222,267<\/div><\/td><td><div>297 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*Covers the period June 2012 to October 2012<\/p><p>** Not yet available from the Central Bank<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700055#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Payments","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700055#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[18263\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700055#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding payment of farm assist in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 14 February 2014 together with the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer.

The incentive is payable, on a monthly basis, over a two year period if the employee is retained in full-time employment for two years.  The value of the aggregate monthly payments is &euro;7,500 for employing a jobseeker 12 to 24 months on the live register and &euro;10,000 if the jobseeker was on the live register for over 24 months.

There are other exceptions, including for instance those undertaking a course of study under the back to education allowance (BTEA) or partaking of an internship under the work placement programme (WPP) or national internship programme (JobBridge), where they may have difficulty accessing the post office during normal working hours and who may, if they wish, opt for their payment to be paid directly into a financial institution.<\/p><p>In January 2014, new provisions were introduced for older people who have left work before reaching the State Pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker's payment.  As a result, those aged 62 or over are no longer subject to the penalty rate provisions if they do not wish to engage in the Department&rsquo;s activation process for jobseekers.  They also have a more relaxed signing regime and may, if they so wish, have their payments made by EFT into an account in a financial institution. <\/p><p>This measure recognises the abolition of the State Pension Transition (SPT) for new entrants from January 2014 and has been introduced to ease the transition until they become eligible for a State Pension on their 66<sup>th<\/sup>birthday.  The introduction of these new arrangements for older jobseekers has been necessary in order to prioritise scarce resources.  <\/p><p>Those under age 62 continue to be subject to the full conditionality of the jobseeker schemes, including mandatory engagement in the activation process, and consequently no letters in relation to the above have issued to people under 30 years of age, as there has been no change to their signing and payment arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700056#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Expenditure","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700057#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[18378\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700057#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a saving would accrue to her Department if all jobseeking clients received their payments through electronic fund transfers and if she will outline the scale of any such saving.

The Strategy sets out a roadmap for payment developments over the coming years.  The Strategy aims to facilitate greater use of electronic payments and to remove the limits that cash payments impose on our clients in terms of making onward financial transactions and availing of discounted prices online while also continuing to serve those who are more vulnerable in our society.    <\/p><p>  The Department is very conscious of the need to ensure that fraud controls are not diminished when implementing change. In achieving an electronic payments environment, the Department will ensure its payment delivery approaches complement and enhance its scheme and payment control functions.  In this regard, the Department proposes to adopt a risk-based approach to all payments, including those made to jobseekers,  in progressively converting to electronic payments.  The rollout and migration of electronic payments will be based on appropriate assessment of risk for the client cohorts involved. It will build on existing control attributes and security. The Department will seek to reassess and evaluate the associated risks and ensure that both preventative point of entry controls and detection systems are modified to securely accommodate the Payment Strategy.  This approach will also be used to identify and combat any trends that are emerging in the financial services sector generally and in instances of fraudulent applications or unusual trends in payments.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Department does not intend migrating higher risk clients to an electronic payment until appropriate and robust measures are defined and fully implemented to mitigate any potential for increased risk of fraud within an electronic payments environment.

This report illustrates that 19 turf cutters could be accommodated on the site.

Details can be accessed at .<\/p><p>A key priority for the Government in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2014<\/i>is the conservation, development and presentation of the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors so as to help make a significant contribution to supporting economic recovery and in sustaining enterprise and job creation across the country. This is achieved through direct support from my Department and the bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group and, in particular, through promoting cultural tourism.<\/p><p>In 2014, there are a number of specific initiatives underway in my Department in relation to the built heritage which will have positive employment benefits. I recently approved funding of almost &euro;5 million from the Government&rsquo;s Capital Stimulus Programme under the Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme for the repair and conservation of 618 structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012. It is anticipated that these projects, with a combined value of &euro;21 million, will unlock &euro;16 million in private funds and support significant employment in the conservation and construction industries and in specialist trades. In tandem with this, my Department is also operating a pilot Traditional Skills Training Programme, in conjunction with four local authorities, to enhance skillsets in built heritage conservation, thus improving employment prospects for trainees. The creation of approximately 270 high-end construction jobs, many of which are specialist positions, will be provided for through the major renovation project of the historic wings of the National Gallery of Ireland.<\/p><p>With particular reference to historic sites, the protection and promotion of our national heritage assets has a significant role in generating employment through cultural and heritage tourism, through direct employment in built heritage conservation, repair and maintenance, as well as through related employment opportunities in the retail, catering, accommodation and construction sectors. <\/p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, has also recently awarded funding of &euro;0.652m to 144 heritage projects across the country this year under its Heritage Management Grants Programme. <\/p><p>In addition, my Department is concluding the pilot of a heritage-led urban regeneration scheme, the <i>Historic Towns Initiative<\/i>, in Youghal, Westport and Listowel, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Heritage Council and the relevant local authorities.  This initiative aims both to conserve heritage assets and to enhance the visitor experience. <\/p><p>I have also allocated over &euro;56 million in funding for 2014 to the Arts Council, which in turn will provide funding to over 500 individual artists and 870 organisations across a range of arts venues, festivals, arts organisations and touring initiatives. This supports tens of thousands of direct and indirect jobs in Ireland and recognises the important role the arts play in innovation and expression, as well as job creation and economic recovery in 2014.<\/p><p>My Department is also committed in its continuing support of the Irish Film and Audiovisual Industry. This sector has contributed over &euro;168 million to the Irish economy and has witnessed an increase of 42% since 2011.  2014 will see this support continue, with over &euro;13 million earmarked for investment in over 40 significant projects, creating up to 800 jobs in the audiovisual production sector alone.<\/p><p>My Department continues to advance the 1916 Commemoration and Decade of Centenaries programmes, including a range of capital projects, which will directly and indirectly support job creation, as well as cultural tourism. The national programme marking the anniversary of Brian Bor&uacute; and the Battle of Clontarf is also being supported.<\/p><p>In addition, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which is funded from my Department's Vote Group, aims to create 520 new jobs and retain 7,000 existing jobs in the Gaeltacht area by supporting developments in the Life Sciences, Food and Business Support Services and Creative Enterprises sectors and providing ongoing support for community development initiatives. My Department also supports a range of Irish language arts, publishing, creative writing, training and other schemes, as well as festivals and drama companies through Foras na Gaeilge.<\/p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department is determined to support and increase employment across the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors.

","asker":"1050","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160, 162 and 163 together.<\/p><p>  Since market liberalisation in 1999, the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services are delivered in the first instance through private sector operators who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County including Counties Kerry and Westmeath can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.<\/p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in 33 locations in County Kerry, and in 19 locations in County Westmeath, before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputies.  I would point out that the Local Authority has a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the Country. In the case of County Kerry, I note that the County Development Plan recommends against siting a mast within 1km of dwellings. I understand that this is contributing to difficulties in providing broadband and telecommunications services generally in the county.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the Next Generation Broadband Task force report, which concluded its deliberations in 2012, service providers noted the importance of planning and consent processes in facilitating the roll out of infrastructure to support the provision of telecommunications services. The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services. Local Authorities have an important role to play in this regard, particularly in facilitating the provision of infrastructure that supports wireless and fixed line services. <\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p> - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p> - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. <\/p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.  This map will outline exactly the type of broadband available in Counties Kerry and Westmeath. <\/p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700060#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Electricity Market","counter":426,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700060#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","counter":427,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[18342\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700060#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reasons for the delay regarding decisions on the single energy market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":428,"content":"<p><font color=\"#333300\">The Single Electricity Market (SEM) is the wholesale electricity market for the island of Ireland, regulated jointly by the Commission for Energy Regulation (the CER) and its counterpart in Belfast, the Utility Regulator.

I am also very aware of the overarching importance of protecting our marine environment. Realising the economic potential of offshore renewable energy can only be achieved if offshore developments do not adversely impact on our rich marine environment.  The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I published in February, provides the mechanism through which action across Government Departments and Agencies to support the development of offshore renewable electricity generation can be fully coordinated in areas such as environmental monitoring and protection, research and development, consenting procedures, infrastructure requirements and enterprise development.<\/p><p>  The OREDP identifies export as the route to market for offshore wind. I recently stated, with regret, that it has not been possible at this time to conclude an Inter-Governmental Agreement as envisaged in the Memorandum of Understanding I signed with the the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in January 2013. Economic analysis undertaken by my officials clearly indicates that under agreed policy and regulatory conditions, renewable energy trading would deliver significant economic benefits to Ireland and the UK, and would also be attractive to developers. However, renewable energy trading has to be designed to work. Based on further discussions between my officials and the Department of Energy and Climate Change in the UK since the Summit in early March, I am confirmed in the view that given the complexities involved, and key decisions yet to be taken by the UK, delivery by 2020 is not now a realistic proposition. However I believe that in the context of a European Internal Market and greater integration, greater trade in energy between Britain and Ireland is inevitable in the post 2020 scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700060#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700060#WRP01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff Numbers","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700060#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[18293\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700060#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the fact that only four local authorities nationwide employ archaeologists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Act provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. It also assigns responsibility for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) .     <\/p><p>  Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015. The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers.   <\/p><p>  It is understood that t he CER is commencing its public consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties and the approach it is proposing for non-domestic tariffs. The CER will announce its decision on the approved water  charges plan, which will include details of the levels of metered, assessed and standing charges, in August 2014. <\/p><p>  In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water, including the funding available for any proposed affordability measures. The Government has committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage would apply. The free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households. Consequently, decisions on these matters will provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by the CER.   <\/p><p>  The Government has given initial consideration to approaches proposed by me, as Minister, and will further consider these matters over the coming weeks.     <\/p><p>  Under the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations. In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in these Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause and, in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health may exist, the Health Service Executive, ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. <\/p><p>  The 2013 Act requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700061#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Exemptions","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700061#WRQ01025"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[18315\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700061#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the residents of unfinished residential housing estates may acquire exemption from liability for local property tax if it is demonstrated that the conditions in the estate have disimproved to a point at which, consistent with the methodology used in the national housing survey, they would have been assessed as exempt at the time the local property tax was introduced; if not, if he intends to rectify this oversight","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>Under Section 10 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 a waiver from liability can arise for properties located in developments prescribed on a list made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government where the Minister is satisfied that the developments on the list are incomplete to a substantial extent, having regard to the condition of public infrastructure and amenities, including access, water services, public lighting and amenity areas.

The survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency. <\/p><p>Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The objective is to eliminate , to the greatest extent possible, the need for Local Property Tax waivers in respect of Unfinished Housing Developments as soon as possible and a number of approaches, as outlined below, have been adopted towards achieving this objective.   <\/p><p>The development of Site Resolution Plans (SRPs), agreed between residents, developers, funders and local authority personnel for the finalisation of works on site to render estates as habitable as possible, have been pivotal in resolving a large number of estates. In the 2013 National Housing Survey, of the 1,811 estates inspected, there were 607 in some stage of SRPs. Specifically, 281 were agreed and ready for implementation, 213 had commenced while 113 had been completed. I believe that a continuation of this collaborative approach serves the best interests of all concerned and is an effective tool in the resolution process.   <\/p><p>The Public Safety Initiative (PSI), which was launched in March 2011, also provided funding to address immediate public safety issues in unfinished housing developments.\u00a0 The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. <font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5m to local authorities from the funding made available. To date, &euro;3.26m has been drawn down. <\/p><p>To assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments, Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF). The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer\/owner\/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition. I expect that my Department will be in a position to finalise its consideration of the SRF applications in the very near future. I anticipate that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible. <\/p><p>The Report, Resolving Unfinished Housing Developments: Annual Progress Report on Actions to Address Unfinished Housing Developments, published in November 2013, is available on the Housing Agency website, at, and appends a Summary Report of the 2013 National Housing Development Survey.<i><\/i>The key findings of the survey include: a 56% decrease in the number of remaining unfinished developments and a 72% decrease in the number of vacant units since 2010. <\/p><p>Through the above approaches, supported by the findings of the 2013 National Housing Development Survey, the general trend is towards improvement in the conditions of such developments and the situation should improve further over the lifetime of the SRF. There are no plans to revise the list of developments included in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013, either by removing or adding developments to it, at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700061#WRQ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Provision","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700061#WRQ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[18317\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700061#WRQ01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the upgraded sewage treatment plant will be delivered for a town (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>The Athenry Sewerage Scheme was included as two contracts to commence   construction in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &ndash; 2013.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995.  <\/p><p>In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers.  <\/p><p>In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government's objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:-<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. <\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association's claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700064#WRT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700065#WRU00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers Funding","counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700065#WRU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[18265\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700065#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount allocated for Howth Harbour Development under the Fisheries Harbour Investment Programme 2014; if he will provide specific details of the work to be carried out under this programme for the design and planning for pontoons between the Middle and West Pier Howth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is one of the six designated Fishery Harbour Centres, which are owned, managed and maintained by my Department.<\/p><p>  I am happy to inform the Deputy that a total of &euro;1.18 million has been approved for works at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre under the 2014 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, which includes &euro;100,000 for the design and planning of a pontoon between the Middle and West Pier Howth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700065#WRU00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Environment Protection Scheme Payments","counter":545,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700065#WRU00350"},{"type":"question","counter":546,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[18271\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700065#WRU00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding a rural environment protection scheme payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo.

My Department continues to work closely with the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment and the Youth Guarantee and in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700067#WRW01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Services Provision","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700067#WRW01150"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[18374\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700067#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will address the issue that Thai Social Workers may be unaware of six applicants pulling out of the adoption process from Ireland and which may be holding up the process for everyone else on the list meaning an additional wait of up to two or three years if this is not communicated; if she will direct the Adoption Authority of Ireland to make representations to the Thai officials indicating the current active files pending for adoption; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":613,"content":"<p>I have asked the Adoption Authority to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700067#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":615,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700067#WRW01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Pricing","counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700067#WRW01350"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[18287\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700067#WRW01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will introduce legislation to provide for minimum alcohol pricing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.

Under the legislation, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has statutory responsibility for establishing and maintaining a list of interchangeable medical products.  In doing so, the IMB is required to have regard to a comprehensive set of qualifying conditions, all of which must be complied with before a decision is taken to make a medicinal product interchangeable.  In addition, Section 13 of the Act provides that where a branded interchangeable product is prescribed for a patient and the prescriber is satisfied that the medicinal product, should for clinical reasons, be exempted from substitution, the prescriber shall write 'Do not Substitute' on the prescription.  In these cases, the pharmacist must dispense what is written on the prescription, i.e. is not permitted to substitute with any product in the same group of interchangeable products.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price the Health Service Executive (HSE) will reimburse to pharmacists for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.<\/p><p>  Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products prices at or below the reference price.

In cases where substitution is prohibited for clinical reasons, patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.

This study is welcome as it provides comprehensive information on the impact of stroke for survivors and their carers.<\/p><p>  Many developments in cardiac care have been brought about through various means including the National Cardiovascular Health Policy.  This policy named &ldquo;Changing Cardiovascular Health&rdquo; covers from 2010 to 2019.  It provides an integrated and quality assured approach for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular disease including stroke.  Since 2010, significant improvements have been made with regard to access to acute treatments for coronary heart disease as well as the development of stroke units across the country.  As Minister for Health, I was pleased to outline these at the launch of the Irish Heart Foundation Stroke day on 11th April last week.<\/p><p>  Key elements of Stroke care now available include: New and existing stroke units provided with additional therapy, nursing and consultant posts; The Clinical Programme for Stroke continues its work to develop and disseminate care pathways and clinical protocols; A national 24\/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis through service development, telemedicine and training is already available in many hospitals with access protocols agreed for others; Ambulance access protocols are being developed by the Stroke Programme working in partnership with national ambulance service to agree and implement ambulance access protocols.  Thrombolysis is now available to all acute hospitals admitting stroke patients and 9.5% of patients are being thrombolysed.  This rate compares will with the best European figures and exceeds our target 7.5%.<\/p><p>  The Stroke Programme estimates that the number of people with enduring disabilities as a result of stroke has decreased as the percentage of patients with stroke discharged from acute hospitals to nursing homes has dropped from 17.3% in 2009 to 14.5% in 2012.  This is a positive outcome.  The rapid increase in access to thrombolysis, from 3.3% in 2008 to 9.5% in 2012, has resulted in better outcomes for patients.  The Stroke Foundation Education programme developed by the Stroke Programme and available to all staff caring for stroke patients is leading to improved patient experience of stroke service provision.  Patients requiring more intensive rehabilitation are referred to the nearest available rehabilitation service, such as the Stroke Rehabilitation Unit, Baggott Street, Dublin Stroke Rehabilitation Unit, Louth County Hospital, Dundalk Hibernian Stroke Rehabilitation Unit, St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Phoenix Park Stroke Rehabilitation Unit and St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork.<\/p><p>  Stroke rehabilitation can be provided in a number of settings, which range from specialised rehabilitation centres and departments in acute hospitals to outpatient and community settings.  The establishment of managed clinical rehabilitation networks for neurological and prosthetic rehabilitation services in each of the 4 HSE Regions is proposed to facilitate the development of integrated quality rehabilitation services. Currently the only internationally accredited programme of specialist inpatient stroke rehabilitation is delivered at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dublin. However, the Programme&rsquo;s Model of Care outlines that 4 regional hubs, which will have clinical and consultant leadership from a designated specialist in rehabilitation medicine, supporting existing neurologists and specialists in medicine for the elderly, be set up. It will include the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) as the national hub and will also incorporate the setting up of Specialist Community-Based Rehabilitation Teams.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the Department of Health&rsquo;s National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland - in collaboration with the National Clinical Programme for Rehabilitation Medicine and its Model of Care - will provide for improved access to and quality of services for all patients requiring rehabilitation and their families.<\/p><p>  Primary Care also plays an important role in stroke rehabilitation.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2013 provided for additional funding of &euro;20m to strengthen primary care services (&euro;18.525m for the recruitment of 264.5 primary care team posts and &euro;1.475m to support Community Intervention Team development).  The posts were allocated based on the analysis carried out by the HSE in identifying areas of deprivation and need.  The additional primary care posts includes 72 Public Health Nurses, 40.5 Registered General Nurses, 47.5 Physiotherapists, 52.5 Occupational Therapists and 52 Speech and Language Therapists.<\/p><p>  As of 6th March 2014, 199.5 posts have been filled or start dates have been agreed.  The HSE is striving to have the remainder of the posts filled as soon as possible in 2014.  Taken together, all these developments show that we have made significant progress in preventing stroke and its complications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700068#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700069#WRY00075"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[18353\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700069#WRY00100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the implementation of the national neurorehabilitation strategy; and report the number of extra community neurorehabilitation teams that have been put in place since the publication of the strategy.

","asker":"962","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive operates under the legislative framework of the Health Act of 1970, as subsequently amended.  In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged, irrespective of the age of the person, to ensure that a person's eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines.  The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to the medical card schemes is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement.<\/p><p>The current structured processes in operation in PCRS concerning medical and GP visit card applications, reviews and appeals must be supported with a range of documentation, as outlined on the application forms.  Where such supporting documentation is not supplied, or is incomplete, to enable the assessment of an application, in accordance with the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE will issue correspondence to the applicant, specifying the additional information required to progress the assessment of their application.  Clearly, the processing time for incomplete applications is dependent on the furnishing of the required supporting documentation by the applicant.<\/p><p>Any medical card holder undergoing a review to renew a medical card, who genuinely engages with the HSE, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of their right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to them.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, he\/she also retains the medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided. <\/p><p>Towards the end of 2013, the HSE announced a communications campaign designed to raise awareness of the rules governing eligibility for medical cards.  This included providing extra resources to the national Call Centre for public enquiries, a public information campaign through media advertisements, the development of a key new Information Leaflet, improved support on the HSE website, and included wide ranging training for front line staff.  Given, also, that over 40% of the population, or nearly 2 million people, qualify for a medical card or GP visit card, the scale of the administration of the general medical services, GMS, scheme is significant.  Over 700,000 individuals were assessed by the HSE in 2013 and well in excess of 95% of applications were processed within the target of 15 working days. <\/p><p>The HSE is now completing medical card reviews for approximately 86,000 individuals per month.  It is expected that increased data sharing between Revenue, Department of Social Protection and the HSE has the potential to further reduce the level of documents and information required from families as their eligibility status is reviewed.  In view of the assessment processes involved, I am satisfied that every effort is made to assist, support and facilitate persons undergoing review and in the most timely fashion. <\/p><p>Each week the HSE publishes the turnaround time for medical card processing and this data is available on the Primary Care Reimbursement Services website: .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700069#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Delays","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700069#WRY01550"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[18423\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700069#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an appointment and treatment for a person (details supplied) in County Kildare will be expedited in view of the urgency of their condition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":676,"content":"<p>Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

","asker":"1052","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":698,"content":"<p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme provides financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care services in nursing homes.  Under the Scheme, applicants contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of any assets per annum towards their cost of care.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual's assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is disregarded from the financial assessment.  Applicants, therefore, retain at least 20% of their income.  However, it should be noted that the Scheme also provides for a minimum retained threshold.  This ensures that applicants retain at least 20% of the maximum amount of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). Applicants are free to spend this retained income as they wish.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of residential care, which are:<\/p><p>- nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,<\/p><p>- bed and board,<\/p><p>- basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living, and<\/p><p>- laundry service.<\/p><p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payments Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or  residence in a nursing home.  Incontinence wear, where required, is provided free of charge by the HSE to all Nursing Homes Support Scheme residents that possess a Medical Card.<\/p><p>  In determining the services covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, it was considered very important that the resident and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, goods and services that are already available under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  Part 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700070#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescription Charges","counter":699,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700070#WRZ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":700,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[18505\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700070#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total amount raised from prescription charges in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":701,"content":"<p>The total amount raised from prescription charges in 2013 amounted to &euro;85.6 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700070#WRZ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":702,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700070#WRZ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[18508\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041700070#WRZ01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is concerned that a medical assessment of an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details provided) in County Kerry has not been completed after being sent for review 11 weeks ago; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
