A review of the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro generation including broadening the scheme to include other groups and other technologies. As I outlined in the D&aacute;il on 27 November last, in response to the Micro Generation Support Scheme Bill, I am supportive in principle of providing a route to market for citizens and communities to generate their own renewable energy and receive a fair and efficient price for doing so.

As well as carbon abatement and sequestration, measures that result in energy displacement (i.e. substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy and renewable materials) have also been a focus of discussions. Reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020, which will likely incentivise particular farming practices and processes, will clearly play a significant role in determining the overall shape and configuration of the Irish agri-food sector in the next decade, and the European Commission's current CAP proposals - which place a welcome focus on sustainability criteria, including carbon emissions -- will play a critical role in the transition to more environmentally sustainable farming processes and activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400044#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":22,"content":"<p>Question No. 17 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":23,"content":"<p>Question No. 18 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Schemes","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400044#WRA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[3402\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400044#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the measures he will take to ensure a greater uptake in SEAI grants in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>The energy efficiency grants administered by the SEAI are funded by my Department. Grants are available to homeowners for insulation, heating controls, heat pumps and solar thermal hot water heating systems. Grants are also available for solar PV systems, electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging. Grants are also available for businesses to improve their energy efficiency.    The majority of the home energy grants are available to homeowners whose properties were built before 2006. Since the introduction of these grants nearly 400,000 homes across the country have received an energy efficiency upgrade, representing nearly one home in five across the country. Grants are administered through a range of schemes:<\/p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Homes scheme provides a financial incentive, typically covering 30% of the cost of works, to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.<\/p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme provides a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty who meet the defined eligibility criteria. <\/p>  <p>  - The Deep Retrofit Pilot Programme is available to homeowners who want to upgrade their house to an A BER while availing of grant support of up to 50%. 4 homeowners in Cork availed of this grant in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Communities scheme supports energy efficiency upgrades to mixed projects of homes, community facilities and businesses in a local community. This scheme provided funding of &euro;20m in 2018 to 37 projects across the country, upgrading 1,189 homes and 454 community buildings. In 2018 12 of these projects included homes and community buildings in County Cork. <\/p>  <p>  - The Sustainable Energy Communities scheme supports and funds communities to build capacity and develop plans to upgrade the energy efficiency of their local area. 24 communities in Co Cork are signed up to the network.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 &euro;5,251,691 was invested in improving the efficiency of homes in Co Cork. This was an increase of almost &euro;1.7m on the investment made in 2017 in Co Cork, reflecting the increased investment overall by Government in energy efficiency. Fewer homes were upgraded however, reflecting the shift to deeper, more expensive measures that also result in more carbon savings.<\/p>  <p>  A number of actions are already underway to encourage investment in energy efficiency and further uptake of home energy grants by homeowners across the country. For example, the Better Energy Homes Scheme was expanded in 2018 to support the transition away from fossil fuels, and achieve greater energy savings and emissions reductions, by introducing a new grant for heat pumps and increasing the grant amount available for all other measures. In addition, the Better Energy Warmer Homes was also expanded in 2018 to include internal and external wall insulation which allows more people to avail of the scheme and also increases the energy savings and emissions reductions from the investment made.

This a critical policy area on which the Plan will focus considerable ambition and I anticipate that a significant scale-up in the penetration of renewables will feature in the Plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400046#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400046#WRC03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Deployment","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400046#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[3481\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400046#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 20, 25 and 32 of 17 January 2019, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that UNIFIL and UNDOF operate under UN Charter Article VI which is primarily in relation to peacekeeping and that the mission to Mali, MINUSMA is under UN Charter Article VII which means it is a mission to maintain peace through force and thus qualitatively different to UNIFIL.","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[3482\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400046#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the reason he considers the Army Ranger Wing would be suitable to serve in the MINUSMA mission in Mali in view of the fact that it is an elite special forces unit that is not trained or organised for peacekeeping.","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Army Ranger Wing (ARW) are the  Special Operations Forces of the Defence Forces.

They are an elite military unit and their capability is a significant asset to the State both in a domestic national security role and in an overseas role.  <\/p>  <p>  The ARW is part and parcel of the capabilities available to the State to be deployed in support of our national security and overseas peace support operations.   They are deployed overseas to UN peacekeeping missions in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Acts and their deployment is covered by the same legislative provisions as apply to the rest of the Permanent Defence Force.  The statutory authority for the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service overseas is set out in Section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No.2) Act, 1960 as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006.  The ARW have previously been deployed on UN mandated peacekeeping operations including, in what was then East Timor with INTERFET, in Liberia with UNMIL and in Chad with EUFOR tChad\/RCA where their particular skill set has been required.  <\/p>  <p>  MINUSMA, the UN mission in Mali is a authorised under Chapter VII of the UN Charter by the UN Security Council.  It is a significant UN peace enforcement mission comprising both regular and special operations forces and high end capabilities.  The option to deploy a small contingent of Army Ranger Wing personnel to MINUSMA as part of a larger Special Operations Forces within the mission later this year has arisen.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland currently has no Defence Forces personnel deployed to the UN mandated MINUSMA mission.  However, potential overseas missions are considered on an on-going basis.  The Department and the Defence Forces are in the very early information gathering stage in considering this particular mission.  This involves getting detailed information on the mission and its operations, consideration of the possible role which the Defence Forces may be able to undertake in the mission, how such a deployment fits with Defence Forces capabilities having regard to existing and potential commitments at home and overseas and a detailed threat analysis and assessment.  This process has only just commenced and will take a period of time to reach a conclusion.  On foot of the respective military and policy advice arising from this process, I will then consider the matter.  I should emphasise again that no decision has been taken yet and there is some way to go in the process before we reach that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400046#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Barracks Closures","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400046#WRC03600"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[3504\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400046#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the amount paid to private security firms for the provision of security services by the Defence Forces in each of the past three years in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>When a military installation is closed and is surplus to requirements all military responsibility for the installation ceases.

In 2017 SUSI provided some &euro;370m in student supports that benefitted more than 78,000 students. \u00a0Additional funding of &euro;4 million was secured in Budget 2017 and a further &euro;3m in Budget 2018 to facilitate the reinstatement of full maintenance grants, from September 2017, for the most disadvantaged postgraduate students. <\/p>  <p>  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education published in 2015 has as its overall vision the goal of ensuring that the student body entering, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population.

The objective of PATH 1 is to increase access to initial teacher education for students from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan, namely Students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, Mature students,\u00a0 Students with disabilities, Travellers, Part time\/flexible learners and Further Education award holders. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2018, I\u00a0published the Action Plan\u00a0for\u00a0Teacher Supply.

It is intended that this action will be progressed over the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  Also under the Action Plan, the Department is exploring the provision of additional supports for postgraduate ITE students.  Following from this, an additional &euro;1 million was added to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for the current academic year 2018\/19 for students attending PME programmes.  The SAF provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.

This includes developing standards, policies and carrying out accreditation of pharmacy degree programmes.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2014, the Minister for Health approved changes to the education and training of pharmacists.  This change in Pharmacy education has come about because the regulatory body, the PSI, now requires graduates to have completed a Masters degree before entering the PSI Register and practising as a Pharmacist.

I can assure the Deputy that this approach is kept under constant review.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,400 recruits have attested as Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Garda numbers reached almost 14,000 by the end of 2018.\u00a0 The Garda Commissioner intends to recruit an additional 600 Garda&iacute;\u00a0next year along with redeploying a further 500 Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and this is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.\u00a0 As part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnership initiatives with important rural-based organisations such as the IFA, Muintir na Tire and other community organisations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is appropriate\u00a0to also\u00a0highlight the Government&rsquo;s plan to implement the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.\u00a0 Those recommendations have a core focus on a more visible Garda organisation working closely and collaboratively with communities and other agencies to keep communities safe and to prevent harm to vulnerable people. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the deployment of Garda resources, including personnel, to specific areas, members will appreciate that this is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. However, I am advised that Garda management constantly monitor the distribution of these resources in light of crime trends and overall policing needs at local level &ndash; and this applies equally in both rural and urban areas.\u00a0A total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work in both rural and urban communities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since November 2015, there has been concentrated policing activity throughout the country as a result of Operation Thor. As of January 2019,\u00a0there have been over 177,000 targeted checkpoints and more than 270,000 crime prevention patrols carried out nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of\u00a09,300 arrests and 10,600 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.\u00a0 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to bring pressure on the gangs and individuals responsible for these type of offences. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On 20 December 2018, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) published the latest crime statistics for Q3 2018. \u00a0While I am pleased that, nationally,\u00a0burglary and theft-related offences were down, I am concerned that offences relating to robbery increased over the 12 month period to the end of Q3 2018 when compared to the end of Q3 2017.\u00a0 This trend must be tackled comprehensively, and the\u00a0focus on the recruitment of new Garda&iacute; and increased resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reflect this Government&rsquo;s commitment to support Garda&iacute; in the fight against crime.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that at the National Ploughing Championships last September, I announced details of the 2018 Text Alert Rebate Scheme which was available to over 1000 local groups registered under the Garda Text Alert Scheme. My Department committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for\u00a0Government\u00a0also committed to support investment in CCTV systems and a grant-aid scheme was launched by\u00a0my Department\u00a0in 2017 to assist in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas with\u00a020 CCTV grants scheme applications approved to date.\u00a0The scheme is open to all groups wishing to take advantage of the available funding.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I believe it is absolutely vital that, as elected officials, we continue to encourage all citizens to report all instances of criminality to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Only then can the crime be properly investigated by Garda&iacute;.\u00a0Furthermore, these reports will allow the Garda authorities to identify any new or emerging crime trends affecting a particular community and, where necessary, allocate Garda resources in order to tackle these developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400051#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400051#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[3473\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400051#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he or his officials met the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2018 to discuss drink driving legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my officials meet with officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on an ongoing basis, in a number of different fora, in relation to road traffic matters. <\/p>  <p>  The overarching\u00a0road traffic\u00a0policy structure is the Ministerial Committee on Road Safety, the function of which\u00a0is to oversee the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 and provide a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Committee is chaired by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and attended by myself (or officials from my Department), the Attorney General, CEO of the Road Safety Authority (RSA), the Garda Commissioner (or a senior representative) and officials from other relevant bodies.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee has met on 18 occasions to date under the current Road Safety Strategy, and is scheduled to meet next on 5 March 2019.

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million.  <\/p>  <p>  It has been designed to assist eligible Irish businesses in the short-term to deal with the challenges of Brexit, which include the pressures of increased market instability and currency volatility. The scheme is open to both State Agency clients and businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies. Sole traders may also apply. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process.  First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. This application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. Guidance is available on the SBCI website on how to complete a business plan.  The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. <\/p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank.

These safety features take the form of an anti-tamper device (e.g. foil seal, breakable cap) and a set of unique identifiers embedded in a 2D barcode on the pack.  <\/p>  <p>  The Delegated Regulation is directly applicable across all EU Member States. \u00a0However, a Statutory Instrument is being prepared to ensure that the Irish legislative system is consistent with the requirements of the new Regulation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Delegated Regulation was finalised and published in 2016.  The intervening\u00a03 year transition period allowed more than ample time for all concerned parties to prepare well in advance of the legislation coming into full effect on 9th February 2019.\u00a0 Details of the requirements of the Delegated Regulation have been widely communicated to all sectors throughout this 3 year transition period, including to the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The intention of the provisions of the national Regulations in respect of persons authorised to supply medicinal products to the public, is that the offences for non-compliance with this EU Commission Delegated Regulation will be in line with offences already set out in other national medicinal product legislation.  The new national Regulations, The Medicinal Products (Safety Features on Packaging) Regulations 2019, currently in draft form, are made under Section 32 of the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, as is the case with existing medicinal\u00a0product Regulations which already provide for such\u00a0rules and offences for non-compliance occurrences. <\/p>  <p>  As with other medicinal products Regulations, this national legislation will provide that the &lsquo;persons&rsquo; upon whom any proposed sanctions or penalties are placed may be a body corporate as well as an individual.

It is\u00a0the responsibility of the body corporate to ensure that the infrastructure is in place and correctly functioning to facilitate the pharmacist\u00a0decommissioning the medicinal product from the national repository prior to supplying to the patient.

The regulatory model for medicines is becoming more complex, and EU pharmacovigilance legislation has led to an increase in the number of referrals and regulatory actions arising from the outcome of these referrals.

One of the recommendations included the introduction of an integrated 5-year Masters level programme of education and training for pharmacists in line with international best practice, to replace the previous 4 year Bachelor plus 1 year in-service practical training programme.<\/p>  <p>  A National Forum was established to advise and assist the Council of the PSI in its oversight of the development and ongoing delivery of the new fully integrated programme of pharmacy education, training and assessment.

Under the previous model, students became employees during their final year.<\/p>  <p>  Since September 2015, students commencing their pharmacy education undertake a PSI-accredited five-year fully integrated Master&rsquo;s degree programme in pharmacy, with the first cohort awarded this MPharm degree graduating in 2020.

Therefore, my Department has had extensive engagement with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys and her Department in relation to employment permits for non-European Economic Area nationals.<\/p>  <p>  This engagement culminated in my Department submitting a detailed, evidence based case to Minister Humphreys Department earlier this year which laid out the justification for granting employment permits to three sectors &ndash; dairy farm assistants, general operatives in meat plants, and horticultural farm assistants. This resulted in the introduction in May 2018 of a pilot quota of permits by Minister Humphreys, including 500 for horticulture workers. So far, I understand that 39 of these have been issued, with around 60 applications having been received. These numbers are lower than was expected, although I understand that with the drought and the timing of the announcement, demand may have been lower than anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside the dedicated pilot scheme for the agri-food sector, it is also important to point out that an overarching review of the broader employment permit system has been carried out by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Minister Humphreys published the report on this review last September and my Department, having actively participated in the review, is now part of an inter-departmental group tasked with implementing the recommendations. I am confident that this exercise will lead to a permit regime that is more flexible and adaptable to the labour needs of the agri-food sector, particularly for seasonal employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400061#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400061#WRS02600"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[3693\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400061#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of applications received to date for the Brexit loan scheme for food businesses by company size (details supplied); the number of applications approved and not approved, respectively, to date by firm size; and the number of loans granted to date.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":614,"content":"<p>The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme was designed, in cooperation with DBEI and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), to provide working capital support to enable eligible Irish businesses to implement necessary changes to address the challenges posed by Brexit.

The report sets out the progress that Ireland has made in reducing reliance on fossil fuels for transport, heating and electricity production. In 2017, as Ireland&rsquo;s economy grew by 7.2% as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) or 3% as measured by gross national income (GNI), whereas energy use increased by 0.5%. The report also states that renewable energy use grew by 52% between 2013 and 2017.  Notwithstanding this, over 90% of all energy used, including transport, in Ireland in 2017 was from fossil fuels. <\/p><p>There are no specific international requirements on the composition of electricity generation in the fuel mix.  The EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009\/28\/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.

Table 11 (Page 34) shows that the share of electricity from renewable energy has increased fourfold between 2005 and 2017 &ndash; from 7.2% to 30.1% - an increase of 23 percentage points over 12 years.  Table 11 also shows how electricity production from wind energy has increased to the point where it accounted for 84% of the renewable electricity generated in 2017.  Electricity generated from biomass accounted for 8% of renewable electricity in 2017. Biomass consists of contributions from solid biomass, landfill gas, the renewable portion of waste and other biogas (including anaerobic digestion). Renewable electricity (or non-fossil fuel) generation accounted for 30.1% of gross electricity consumption in 2017.

In the electricity sector, which accounts for less than one fifth of Ireland's overall emissions, we have made good progress and are well on our way to our target of 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector by at least 80% by 2050.  As energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are linked, meeting this objective requires a radical transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominantly fossil fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system.   As set out in the Energy Policy White Paper, a low-carbon future involves moving away from high-emissions fuels in electricity generation to lower emissions fuels such as gas, and ultimately away from fossil fuels altogether.  This policy is fully aligned with EU policy objectives of decarbonisation in the electricity sector. <\/p>  <p>  On the way to achieving this low-carbon future, it is settled policy that Moneypoint will cease burning coal by 2025, and the three peat-fired electricity generating stations in th Midlands will cease burning peat before 2030. All three plants have been awarded support for biomass combustion under the REFIT3 Scheme for up to 30% of the installed capacity up to 2030. Bord na M&oacute;na commenced co-firing at its Edenderry Plant with biomass in 2008, and it is expected that ESB will commence co-firing at its 2 peat fired plants with biomass in 2020, subject to the plants receiving planning permission. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to electricity generating stations being restricted in the past twelve months on the basis of their levels of GHG emissions, all fossil fuel based stations participate under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which is a system designed to reduce emissions and provides a strong incentive to decarbonise the manner in which these installations produce electricity. EU ETS carbon prices have been on average over &euro;20 per tonne since August 2018. As the carbon price rises even further, these installations become less economically viable, and incentivises companies to move to lower GHG emitting technologies, including renewable generation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400064#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":684,"content":"<p>Question No. 250 answered with Question No. 247.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Generation","counter":685,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400064#WRV01500"},{"type":"question","counter":686,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[3674\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400064#WRV01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the daily requirement of electricity generated and available to the domestic and industrial markets without restriction; the extent to which this is compliant with public service obligations such as the need to ensure continuity of supply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":687,"content":"<p>The Electricity Security of Supply Report 2018 published by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities on 8 November 2018, points to peak daily system electricity demand in Ireland recorded during 2017 was close to, but slightly higher than, 5GW.

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to mobile telephony service quality in other countries, comparisons between Member States and within regions can be problematic for many reasons, including the fact that the technical characteristics of mobile phone networks determining coverage and capacity will vary between operators and locations.  Other factors include the characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc. <\/p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce produced a report in December 2016, available on my Department's website, containing 40 actions to alleviate telecommunications networks coverage deficits. An Implementation Group is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the Taskforce actions.  Of the 40 actions, 29 had been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the inaugural National Stakeholder Forum 2017, 23 new measures were identified for delivery in 2018. The outcome of discussions at the second Annual National Stakeholder Forum held in October 2018 informed preparation of the 2018 Annual Review report which will be published shortly together with the 2019 Work Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Some of the Taskforce's key achievements to date in addressing mobile phone coverage issues include:<\/p>  <p>  - Work by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.<\/p>  <p>  - Both Departments are working with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.<\/p>  <p>  - Establishment of a focus group to provide guidance with respect on categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The focus group report was published on my Department's website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots, as well as informing future policy in my Department with regard to priorities for mobile phone services.<\/p>  <p>  - Work underway by a working group which is investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the service available to them. <\/p>  <p>  - Development by ComReg of a licensing scheme enabling households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.<\/p>  <p>  ComReg is providing expert advice to the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce and has committed to implementing a number of actions designed to improve the service experience of mobile phone users. In late 2016, in accordance with its strategic plan and in alignment with taskforce actions, the Regulator commenced several projects to gain greater understanding of factors affecting mobile user experience, including the effect of building materials on indoor coverage. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017 ComReg published the results of a survey, the first of its kind in Ireland, investigating Irish people's experience and perceptions of their mobile phone service. The survey involved over 2,800 face-to-face interviews and to ensure that the experience of those in rural areas were captured, the survey sampled a higher percentage of those living in less densely populated parts of the country. The full report can be found on ComReg's website at www.comreg.ie\/publications. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators' commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. at least one operator has now in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. <\/p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400064#WRV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400064#WRV02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Car Test","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400064#WRV02300"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[3465\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400064#WRV02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if there have been policy changes or changes to the way in which the national car test, NCT, is conducted in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>The governing legislation\u00a0for the National Car Test is provided by the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 - S.I.

A detailed business plan for the LDA is currently in development and will provide additional information on its delivery programme.<\/p><p>Acknowledging that renters in Dublin are currently facing significant access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.<\/p><p>A significant early mover project is being advanced by Dublin City Council,\u00a0which will deliver important lessons in terms of cost rental in an Irish setting, at Emmet Road, Inchicore. While the final tenure-mix on the site will be decided by Dublin City Council, to be informed by the detailed site development process, it will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided by the City Council under cost rental arrangements. My Department is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency, the European Investment Bank and the\u00a0LDA to examine the optimum funding and delivery options to support cost rental delivery at scale in Dublin and other urban areas.<\/p><p>Finally the approved housing body sector includes a number of housing co-operatives whose objectives are to provide social and affordable housing. These bodies are supported through a range of schemes for both social and affordable housing which are funded by the State through the local authorities. In addition, some local authorities facilitated housing developments through supporting co-operatives to deliver housing under the low cost sites scheme. With the introduction of a new affordable purchase housing scheme and cost rental, supported by the Serviced Sites Fund, there will be further opportunities for approved housing bodies, including co-operatives, to provide affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400068#WRZ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Maintenance","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400068#WRZ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[3452\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012400068#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans and the timeline for funding and delivering a refurbishment programme for flat complexes in Dublin city centre to tackle in particular dampness and to provide for insulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":824,"content":"<p>It is very important that local authority housing stock is maintained to an appropriate standard.

In seeking to ensure that the commemorative programme is authentic and comprehensive, I am particularly interested in ensuring that the vital role of women in making and shaping our national shared history will continue to be acknowledged and lead to a deepening of the public awareness and understanding of the role. <\/p>  <p>  The history and achievements of Cumann na mBan have previously been commemorated under the State commemorative programme, specifically with a conference at the National Museum Collins Barracks in April 2014 and a commemorative stamp issued by An Post the same year.  In 2016 the State commemoration to honour the role of women in the Easter Rising was led by President Higgins at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on International Women's Day.  On 6 February last year I marked the date of passage of the legislation introducing the voting rights for women and their right to stand in parliamentary elections with the publication of the Mn&aacute;1916 book by my Department, a copy of which I shared with each member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.
