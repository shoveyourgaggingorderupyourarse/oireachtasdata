Thanks to the Chairman and the committee for the invitation.  As the Chairman said, I am joined by Eddie Casey, chief economist and head of secretariat at IFAC, and Niall Conroy, an economist with the secretariat and other members of the secretariat.<\/p> <p>  The council published its fifth pre-budget statement on 7 September which reviews the fiscal stance in advance of the budget.  The assessment is based on an economic analysis assessing the appropriateness of the fiscal stance and an assessment of the Government&rsquo;s fiscal plans in terms of the overall budgetary framework.  At the outset, we think it is important to note the substantial progress that has been made to move the public finances to a safer position since 2008.  The Government is running close to a balanced budget.  Debt ratios look to be on a steady downward trajectory and near-term growth and interest prospects are relatively favourable.  This means that Ireland is in a good position to move the public finances to safer levels and that there is no need to stimulate the economy any more than is already planned.<\/p> <p>  In assessing the appropriate fiscal stance for 2019, the council notes that the economy is close to its potential and that the budget deficit, excluding one-off items, is almost closed.  This would imply that the structural budgetary position is also near balance.  This suggests that little further adjustment is required in structural terms to close an underlying deficit or to enable a steady pace of reduction in the Government debt ratio.<\/p> <p>  To maintain this position, it is essential that spending increases or revenue reducing measures are introduced at a sustainable pace.  The council therefore assesses that the Government should stick to its existing budget plans for 2019 of a budget day package of &euro;800 million.  This would increase Government expenditure, net of tax measures, in line with the sustainable long-term growth rate of the economy.  Various estimates put this at approximately 3.25% per annum.  When combined with inflation, this would imply an approximate limit of up to &euro;3.5 billion for spending increases or tax cuts for 2019.  There is no case for additional stimulus in 2019 beyond this figure.<\/p> <p>  The cost of previously announced measures, including sharp increases in public investment spending, means that the scope for new initiatives in budget 2019 is limited.  If additional spending measures are to be addressed in 2019 beyond the quantity in the summer economic statement, these should be funded by additional tax increases or through re-allocations of existing spending.<\/p> <p>  An earlier than planned move to a small budget surplus would be warranted if cyclical growth and corporation tax receipts continue to exceed expectations.  Any unexpected increases in tax revenues or lower interest costs that arise this year or in 2019 should not be used to fund budgetary measures beyond those currently planned.<\/p> <p>  The risks of overheating and the narrowing window of opportunity provided by a favourable external environment would suggest that improving the budget balance by more than currently planned would be desirable.  This would be especially warranted if revenues were to outperform expectations for reasons that might prove to be temporary.  This includes higher corporation tax receipts or stronger than expected growth in the domestic economy.  The Government should instead use these receipts to build buffers either through additional contributions to the rainy day fund or through a budget surplus and faster debt reduction.  Moreover, expenditure ceilings should not be allowed to continue to drift up as unexpected and likely cyclical or transitory revenues arise.<\/p> <p>  Most plausible estimates suggest that the domestic economy has been growing faster than its potential growth rate since 2014 and is now close to its potential.  Central forecasts suggest that it will move beyond potential from 2019 onwards, with some overheating emerging in later years.  Looking ahead, it is inevitable that adverse shocks will occur in coming years.  Three major sources of potential downside risks to Ireland are apparent: Brexit, rising protectionism and the international tax environment.<\/p> <p>  The size and nature of potential impacts from various Brexit scenarios are highly uncertain.<\/p><p>In the context of the international tax environment, the highly concentrated nature of Irish corporation tax receipts means that substantial reductions in Government revenue could arise if even one large firm was to relocate its operations elsewhere.<\/p><p> Although efforts to stabilise the public finances since the crisis have proven successful, improvements on the budgetary front have stalled since 2015.  This comes despite a strong recovery in the economic cycle &ndash; both domestically and internationally &ndash; in addition to a supportive monetary policy environment.  Non-interest spending has risen at essentially the same pace as tax revenue since 2015 and, as a result, the strong cyclical recovery and favourable external environment have not led to any notable improvement in the underlying budgetary position, excluding interest savings.  Recent revenue growth has been supported by short-term cyclical developments and a possibly transient surge in corporation tax receipts.  Looking through these effects, the underlying structural position would appear to have deteriorated since 2015.<\/p><p> Health spending for 2018 again looks set to exceed the level of planned increases set out at budget time.  The Department of Health has experienced numerous overruns historically, and the problem of unrealistic forecasts coupled with a soft budget constraint has undermined the credibility of expenditure ceilings.  To ensure that the overall level of spending increase for 2018 does not go beyond existing planned increases, and to ensure that the pattern of spending drift does not continue into 2018, it is important that pressures in the Department of Health budget should be absorbed elsewhere.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s debt burden is still among the highest in the OECD.  When set against a more appropriate measure of national income such as GNI*, Ireland&rsquo;s net debt burden for 2017 was equivalent to 96%, the fourth highest in the OECD, behind only Portugal, Italy and Japan.<\/p><p> Looking beyond this budget, the council assesses that the Government should reinforce its medium-term plans to ensure they are credible.  Focusing on the right budgetary stance and being prepared to be more cautious than the fiscal rules allow is the correct approach for the Government to follow over the medium term.  This is particularly true given that the strict legal application of the current fiscal rules using the EU&rsquo;s commonly agreed methodology for potential output estimation will not necessarily prevent a repeat of pro-cyclical fiscal policy mistakes made in the past.  The rainy day fund is potentially very useful in this regard, but is currently only half-formed and needs further development if it is to be effective.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to attend.  We look forward to taking questions and hearing the views of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coffey.

For a number of weeks, Sinn F&eacute;in has been trying to discover how much of that overspend is going to be classed as a recurrent cost because the answer to that question will impact on the budgetary process.  We have not been able to get an answer.  In the document supplied by Mr. Coffey, it is stated that the overspend seems to be driven by recruitment, which indicates that the overall run on the health budget should be classed as a recurring spend.  Perhaps Mr. Coffey could comment on that.  We are close to budget time and are still unable to identify how much of that black hole is down to recurring costs or how it will impact on the budgetary process.  Does Mr. Coffey have any thoughts or comments on how we are monitoring our health budgets?  This is an ongoing issue.  Estimates are calculated every year, but even the Estimate we are looking at this year ranges between &euro;600 million and &euro;800 million.  There is no exact figure yet.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to figure No. 2 on page 13 of the pre-budget statement provided by Mr. Coffey, which gives us an indication of areas which potentially could overheat.  Much of the commentary we have heard to date has been about housing and construction and how that area might impact on the economy, which might lead to its overheating.  However, the chart provided seems to suggest there is no risk of overheating, or that there is a very minimal risk of overheating, through housing construction, and that non-housing construction is a potential driver for overheating.  Could Mr. Coffey go into more detail on that matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#C00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537362000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The council has spent a lot of time discussing those two points.  On the health budget, we are no more informed than the Deputy and are depending on Departments and Ministers to provide us with that information.  We are told that not all of the overrun will be built into budget 2019, and it is not expected that all of the overrun will be recurring.  However, we are not told the breakdown.  The indication that a certain amount of the overrun was caused by recruitment suggests that it should have been predictable.  Not only is it going to be a recurring item of expenditure - it will still be in place next year - but it should also be predictable.  One of the issues with the constant overruns in the health budget is that they undermine our ability to assess budgetary policy.  The Government has set out a plan for 2019, which we have assessed and which we believe to be in line with prudent economic and budgetary management.  We also assessed the plan that was set out last year and thought the same.  As we progress through 2018, however, those plans are not being adhered to.  For example, the health budget overrun looks set to amount to hundreds of millions; we do not have the precise figure.  It appears that much of the overrun will be recurring expenditure and will be built into the base figure for 2019.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, one impact of this is that the underlying budgetary position is deteriorating.  While it might appear in headline or nominal terms that we can absorb these increases because of corporation tax and lower interest, if we consider that some of those factors are transitory and look at what is happening on a sustainable basis, it is clear that our underlying position is deteriorating.  We have no additional insight into the health budget beyond what the Department and the Minister are willing to offer.  We agree there should be greater monitoring of the health budget and a greater ability to predict what is required.  If resources are required, they should be made available at the start of the year.  A Minister should not come before a committee in July and say that there should be a supplementary budget.  It is now the middle of September and we do not know what the Supplementary Estimate will be or when it will be passed.  In recent years, Estimates have been passed towards the middle of December, the end of the year, when most of the money has been spent.  The White Paper published on the Friday night before the budget might provide an indication, but we are still left to pick between numbers and assess what is happening.  Such information should be provided.  We share the concerns of the Deputy, but unfortunately we - and others - do not yet have the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Will the White Paper tell us how much of the overrun is recurring expenditure that has to be built into the budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#C00500","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537362000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>No, it will only give the total.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Will we ever find out how much is recurring expenditure?

I do not believe there is a formal process for documenting how much of the budget is carried over.  Until one sees the expenditure report with the budget and what the Department expects the carryover to be, one cannot tell.  The only thing we have received that might be worth looking at is the major expenditure report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Early estimates for the year showed that the number of staff was to increase by 1,800, but 1,700 new staff had already been recruited by May.  Recruitment was running at a much faster pace than had been expected for the full year.  The Department extrapolated from this and concluded that if there were already 1,700 new staff by May and the target for the year was 1,800, then the overall number of new staff is likely to be much higher by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I have looked at some of the recruitment trends in health.

If there are issues with the recurring nature of it, perhaps it should be clearly set out in a more coherent fashion.<\/p><p>It is hard to pinpoint one-off or temporary increases in spending within the Department of Health.  If it is driven by increases in recruitment, population or demand, a fairly safe assumption would be that a large part of them are recurring.<\/p><p> On the second question and the heat map introduced in this pre-budget statement by the council, we are delighted this innovation is having an impact.  On the point regarding houses and housing completions and whether they would show up as a red light within this, the warning from the council is that housing output and construction is a potential source of overheating in the economy.  What is shown on the map is the current forecast as set out by the Department of Finance, which shows relatively modest and stable increases in housing output over the next four to five years.  The level in 2017 of 15,000 new housing units completed will increase in stages of three or four thousand each year out to 2021-2022 to reach 30,000 units, which the Department considers to be the equilibrium for State housing output.  The council's fear is that housing output could reach a tipping point and could increase much faster than that.  While the forecasts might be for stable and steady rises, given the nature of the housing sector and the cyclicality built into it there is potential for housing output to rise much more rapidly.  While that might look fairly benign right now it is something that should be monitored in terms of commencement data and more reliable completions data.  While it looks as if construction is not generating overheating concerns this will remain the case only if there are steady increases over a four or five year period.  If we do reach a tipping point where housing output increases rapidly, given the labour intensity of it and the tax richness of it, we would see difficulties arising.      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>We are in the middle of a housing crisis and we need to increase our housing output, I would argue, over and above the Government target.

In other words, it is entering a position where overheating more generally could arise.  Rapid housing construction has the potential to push the economy over the edge and to overheat.  Other levers that are available to the Government and policymakers would need to be used to dampen down the potential of any strong housing response.

This would be feasible.  Taking the broader economy as a whole, can we dramatically increase housing output in an economy where the unemployment rate is 5.5%?  A key question for us is where are the workers going to come from to build those houses if output is to rise at a much more rapid rate?  For example, are workers from other sectors, including workers previously in construction who moved during the recovery to other sectors, to be drawn back into construction with promises of more attractive wages, leading to an increase in wage pressures across the economy, or are we going to bring in workers from abroad, which is what we did during the previous construction boom?  If we are to bring workers in from abroad we will have to be able to house them.  We would be bringing them in to build houses for themselves before they can build houses for us.

Most of the construction workers that could be building houses are working as taxi drivers because the pay in construction is too low.  If pay and security of employment in construction were better they would move out of taxi driving into construction.  Also, there would be no requirement for new houses because they are already living here.  When talking about housing output should we make a distinction between types of housing output?  To me, overheating could arise if we return to private sector output of the scale we witnessed pre-2008.  A dramatic increase in public sector housing output would be different, for two reasons.  The houses that are being built are being sold at prices that nobody can afford.  The banks, rightly, are not willing to lend to people amounts of money which their income cannot sustain, as they did in the past, leading to the market crashing.  It was at the point everybody realised the emperor had no clothes.  If the investment is in social and affordable housing this problem does not arise because it is creating a revenue stream for the Government.  One would not be financing housing in an unsustainable way.  In terms of current social and affordable housing provision a huge amount of the expenditure is current expenditure, which is an accident waiting to happen.  If the State has its own stock, it is not an accident waiting to happen: it is a revenue stream.

If the increase in the public construction of housing was allied to additional revenue raising measures that created the space in the economy to facilitate that increase in output, it would be on a sustainable footing.  If the majority of the output was sourced in the private sector, it is likely that much of it would be funded through borrowing as new houses tend to be bought by purchasers with mortgages.  There would be no reduction in activity.  Householders would not be cutting back in other areas to fund the initial construction activity in the economy and we could end up with an excess level of capacity.  There definitely is merit in the Deputy's suggestion.  The key point we are making is that if there is to be this increase in housing output, it must be funded by additional revenue measures that automatically generate the space for it.

I shall hypothesise how it could work.  I believe that emphasis in public housing particularly should be around the cost model.  This has the benefit of retaining in State ownership and there is a future income stream that meets the pace for the capital upfront costs over time.  Our construction costs for public housing previously were just a lump sum from the Department of the environment to the local authority; it was not clever and it was anti-cyclical in that it tended to stop and start.  The cost rental model has real potential, especially in the long term, as we build up the asset of public cost rental properties.  Critically, because it is also in the private rental market, that model has the prospect of dampening down the private market rented sector in a way that current housing subsidies will never do.  In some ways that would manage some of the overheating concerns because it is rental pressures in Dublin, for example, that also push up wages and so on.  I am specifically thinking that it must be large scale to effect that level of change on the private market.<\/p> <p>  I am very encouraged to hear Mr. Coffey refer to that sort of long-term investment, particularly where it is long-term borrowing met with revenue streams.  If Ireland needed to fund this and if capital was needed up front to help it to get going, and if we were still to borrow from the European Investment Bank or from somewhere else, one prospect could be the sale of bank shares.  I am aware that the Department of Finance would hate this hypothesising - but would love to bring the debt down - but if some percentage of AIB bank shares were sold and if there was a large lump sum in a cash pile would this be a way to allow for an intervention in the housing market, which we need to do, that does not affect the general budget financing figures?  This could be a practical way of financing such a measure.  Has Mr. Coffey a problem with the hypothetical allocation of a cash stream such as that, which is not coming from tax revenue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#E00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537362000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>We would echo the concerns of the Department of Finance and would not be in favour of such hypothecation.  It does not tend to work.  Money is funded but if the same money came from the same source and is allocated to another source, by and large the appropriate thing to do is consider the overall budgetary situation one is addressing.  There is no shortage of cash or funding within the Irish budgetary position.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is currently managing close to &euro;20 billion in cash terms in the Exchequer account.  Much of that is somewhat precautionary such as for bond redemptions that are coming down the line.  If there are banking asset sales the proceeds would feed into the overall cash holdings that are managed by the NTMA.<\/p> <p>  I do not, however, believe that it would be appropriate to hypothecate, as the Deputy has said.  Money is raised from the sale of assets and if it was to be spent on housing, or in a sense put it on the sidelines of the overall budgetary measures, I think we should be looking at the totality of what we are doing.  If one considers the Government accounts and the allocation to capital spending, one can see that it is increasing significantly.  In 2014-15 it was a little over &euro;4 billion and by 2020 it will be more than &euro;8 billion.  In just five or six years the nominal amount will have almost doubled and Ireland will have gone from being a relatively low government spender on public infrastructure in EU terms to being up towards the top.  There has been a large allocation.   Perhaps one difference in Ireland compared to other EU countries is that their governments tend not to spend directly on capital housing projects.  They do have public housing but in the main it tends to be done through approved housing bodies or housing associations.<\/p> <p>  I do have the long-term view, as referred to by the Deputy, that the cost rental of the older stock, which was produced and constructed at a lower cost, is subsidising the construction and renting of newer stock and could on average have a dampening down effect on the rents and costs in the housing system.  That seems to be more successful than what we are doing, but the issue is to have the long-term view and if we do have housing units within the system that they are not sold off.  It cannot work if older units are sold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I remind members, especially those who joined us late, that due to reasons beyond our circumstances, we have to stop this meeting at 3.30 p.m.  That is our time limit and I ask members to be conscious of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#E00600","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The per capita budget is rising, mainly for roads that will lead to more sprawl with all of us living in Mullingar and commuting to Dublin according to the Minister of State at the Department of Defence.

Professor John FitzGerald at another Oireachtas committee said that for Ireland to meet its climate change targets we need to spend &euro;5 billion retrofitting just the social housing we already have to make it zero carbon and into quality housing.

We have seen a huge swing in our favour with huge tailwinds even before considering the cyclical recovery we have experienced.  Almost all of that &euro;6 billion, which is an unexpected gain since 2015, has been absorbed through either additional increases in spending on health or through a ramping up of public capital spending.  In 2018, even with that &euro;6 billion gain, we are still projected to run a deficit.  That leaves us in a vulnerable position where there could be an economic downturn.  It is likely that it is inevitable that there will be a slowdown at some stage.  There is a strong likelihood of there being a downturn at some stage.

How would the witnesses incentivise using it or what advice do they have to do so?  Vacant housing does not seem to be coming back into use.  I ask the witnesses to forgive me if I am going outside their remit.  I am new to the committee and want to see what their role is, but, equally, how value for money can be achieved and increased momentum generated in house building.  We have dealt enough with health and know where some of the problems are there but we do not seem to be getting a handle on building houses.<\/p> <p>  There are 6,500 people employed in the 100 largest housing agencies.  What if they were divided into and subsumed by the local authorities?  Since I do not come back when I ask questions, my final point is on the issue of how one speeds up a system.  We have people in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment who are at a lesser grade than some of our planners and engineers at local authority level who are toing and froing on schemes.  Would it not make more sense if a lump sum was given to local authorities with the freedom to go and get the job done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#G00700","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537362000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Much of that is outside our mandate and looks at areas for which we do not have direct responsibility.  There is a plethora of housing agencies and we have picked up another in the past week or two.  They are supposed to look at this area.  I am not familiar with employment levels in approved housing bodies.  Our concern with housing, as mentioned in the discussion we had with Deputy Boyd Barrett, is the impact housing activity and construction has on the economy and whether there are resources to meet the activity demand that might emerge.  The design of our housing system is for somebody else to address.  We are concerned with the impact on economic activity, especially of new housing, and, given the tax-rich nature of private housing construction, the impact that can have on public finances.  That is our primary sphere of interest.<\/p> <p>  I will have to put on a completely personal hat in addressing vacant housing because it is not something that IFAC looks at.  I am at a loss to say why there is vacant housing in urban centres and city centre locations, given the rent increases we have seen in recent years.  If someone has a property and owns it, I cannot understand why he or she would leave it sitting idle when there are substantial rents to be collected.  I am not sure what are the costs or hindrances to prevent those from being used or why one would just sit on an asset when substantial rents could be had.  It seems contradictory.  An issue with vacant housing in rural areas is that people prefer large houses outside the town and that is what has happened over a 20 to 30-year period.  The centres of rural towns have become depopulated as people have moved to newer, bigger houses on bigger sites on the outskirts of the town.  That is what people have chosen.  I do not know if we can reverse that.  With regard to the system itself, whether it can be sped up and whether lump sums should be given to local authorities to engage in activities, that is something for somebody else to decide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>If it is not the IFAC's job, whose job is it?

It has been recommended that the Government should not exceed &euro;800 million in the budget day package.  I recall a similar conversation last year about the available fiscal space.  The IFAC's statement was that it was at the upper limits of prudent budgeting.  Lo and behold, with one week to go to the budget, some &euro;300 million was found and it went beyond the council's recommendations for the year.  It is likely that more than &euro;800 million will be spent in the budget day package because it seems to be the practice to hold onto the available fiscal space until the last minute in order that the rest of us do not know about it.  If the budget package is in excess of &euro;800 million, what risks does that pose to our economy?  If it is more than the package should be, what would the IFAC's advice to Government be, as well as to us as the committee that will report on this?<\/p> <p>  On Brexit, it is interesting that the witnesses say the standard models being used may not fully capture the integrated supply chains and the extent of our relationship with the UK.  In our budgetary process, what should we do to try to offset or counteract the worst effects of whatever type of Brexit we get?  We are still planning for the unknown but it will hit in 2019 so we need to do something financially to try to protect our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#H00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537362000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>On the budget package, the issue we have is how it is achieved and where those increases come from.  Is it changing calculations slightly to give an answer that somebody might prefer, or is the space increased through additional revenue-raising measures?  In last year's budget, additional space was created through increases in corporation tax, profits linked to intangible assets and a change in the stamp duty rate for commercial properties.  They created the additional capacity for more measures to be introduced.  In broad terms, if the net answer remains as set out in the summer economic statement, the additional space can be created through that.  That was achieved in last year's budget and it is a useful template that shows that the technical calculation of fiscal space is not this straitjacket or limit that has been set out.  While we would like to see the plans that were set out in the summer economic statement adhered to, it is not a massive restriction and additional space can be created through revenue-raising measures.  By and large, that is what happened last year.  We were reasonably favourable to the approach taken in last year's budget.<\/p> <p>  On Brexit and any financial measures that should be introduced, we do not need to introduce financial measures now, especially from a macroeconomic perspective.  Brexit has yet to happen and it is uncertain.  We can go through various scenarios that might impact on the public finances.  While the fiscal council may call for greater improvement in the budgetary deficit for 2019, and perhaps even a move to a small surplus, there are a number of reasons one does that, one of which is to create fiscal buffers.  We have fiscal buffers in order that we can use them, and in order that if we hit a downturn and experience a significant macroeconomic shock because of Brexit that could lead to a reduction in unemployment, an increase in social welfare, an increase in tax revenue, we just let it happen and the economy can then recover.  We would run up a deficit but if we have the buffers there, the deficit should not be too large.  We will not end up in a situation where we run close to a balanced budget, spend the resources being generated, have a macroeconomic shock with Brexit, along with potential changes in corporation tax or interest rates, and a large deficit opens up.  In a situation where we should let things happen naturally and let those deficits stimulate the economy, we do not want to end up in a situation where Brexit happens and there are tax increases and spending cuts on top of it - the pro-cyclical policy of which we have 40 or 45 years of experience.  While we might call for greater prudence now, the ability to use it is in the future.  If financial measures are required to react to Brexit in a macroeconomic sense, let us wait until it has happened and we will have the space to react appropriately then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018091900002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1537362000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>For example, a revenue-raising measure could be introduced for budget 2019 that we have not been told about such as a change to the hospitality VAT rate, but the argument from those working in the hospitality sector is that they need to protect themselves against Brexit and cannot deal with an increase, which is a different argument.

The IFAC's report would prefer us to run a small surplus this year to get back among those exemplar countries in the OECD area.

We can do both; it is simply a matter of making choices.  If there is not sufficient capacity in the &euro;3.5 billion to meet all those demands, revenue-raising measures can be introduced.  As long as we stay within the overall envelope, we should be able to move to a position of a small budget surplus and achieve whatever additional demands are deemed necessary.

Our systems have improved in capital spending over recent years and decades, primarily driven by developments at EU level, when there were matching funds and various assessments, and undertakings had to be done before the money could be drawn down.  In transport, in particular, we tend to get the appropriate matters undertaken, but there are other areas that could be improved.  We have assessed the overall capital budget that has been set out, and given the resources the economy is generating, we feel a near doubling of capital spending in quite a short period can be achieved within a sustainable envelope.  During the crash, we went to relatively low levels in EU terms and we were barely spending enough for maintenance of our public capital stock, whereas we are now moving to a high level in EU terms and a position where we can add to our public capital stock.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that value for money is important.  The IMF did a recent study, the public investment management assessment or PIMA study, which looked at capital spending in Ireland.  It raised questions about whether we have been getting value for money, but we believe there is capacity to increase capital spending and to do it in a sustainable fashion.  The problem will be if one commits to increasing capital spending and then tries to reduce taxes, increase public sector pay or increase social welfare supports at the same time.  Doing everything is not sustainable.

It is indisputable that the price of accommodation in the private sector is clearly an overheating threat.  One could argue all roads lead to it.  The labour and skills shortage roads lead to it, as do potential wage demands and potential social welfare costs in terms of the cost of emergency accommodation or renting from the private sector.  It is arguable that if one were to look for overheating threats, the housing threat is way beyond any other threat.  The council should flag that more strongly.  That is incumbent upon a body whose remit is to warn against overheating.  For example, NAMA has more or less redeemed all its bonds.  Whatever case is made about what it did with its assets up until now, I believe that NAMA continuing to sell off land is contributing to the overheating threat.

The Fiscal Responsibility Act provides that we should assess budgetary policy to the extent that it is in line with prudent budgetary and economic management.  That is why we developed the heat map, which gives a snapshot of overheating pressures within the economy.  At present, we do not identify significant overheating pressures in the Irish economy and the most recent forecasts from the Department of Finance indicate that this relatively benign scenario is predicted to continue.  Whether that happens is subject to question.  In 2003 and 2004 forecasts at the time would have given a relatively benign scenario as well.  When it comes to overheating the one area where we see potential problems emerging is in the housing sector, whether that relates to the level of prices, the rate of price changes or the impact of activity on the overall level of demand in the economy.  At present, however, the major growth area has been in non-residential construction but we see a potential for that to change.<\/p> <p>  We believe we are highlighting overheating and we are pointing to housing as a potential source of it.  The Fiscal Advisory Council has been raising overheating in its assessment reports since 2015, just as the recovery was finally beginning to emerge fully in the economy.  We are glad that other people are now also taking on board the concerns about what an economy trying to do too much in too short a time can cause.  If we are going to have an increase in housing activity it should be sustainable.  We should not be going from 15,000 in 2017 to 65,000 or 70,000 by 2020 and then drop down to 20,000 again in 2024 or 2025.

As the Chairperson said, I am a member of the Medical Council.  I am also the chairperson of the working group which is reviewing the section relating to abortion in the Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners.  I am joined today by Mr. Bill Prasifka, CEO of the Medical Council.  We are here to discuss the council&rsquo;s role in regard to this important issue, so I will begin by giving a quick outline of the council&rsquo;s responsibilities and functions which are particularly relevant in the context of the referendum result and pending legislative changes.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of doctors within the Republic of Ireland.  Its purpose is to protect the public by promoting and ensuring the highest standards among doctors.  The council works to ensure that medical education and training is always up-to-date and is benchmarked against the highest international standards.  Standards for undergraduate and postgraduate training are set by the Medical Council.  The council also requires doctors to maintain their professional competency through updating and maintaining their professional skills on an ongoing basis.  The Medical Council is also where the public may make a complaint against a doctor.<\/p> <p>  The principal functions of the Medical Council relate to the control of standards of education and training at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, the registration of medical practitioners in accordance with their education and training, the determination of questions of professional misconduct or fitness to practise and the operation of EU directives relating to education and training in the practise of medicine.  The Medical Council also provides guidance to doctors on matters relating to conduct and ethics through its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners.  In summary, the key objective of the council is to protect the interests of the general public in their interactions with registered medical practitioners while also supporting doctors.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Medical Council&rsquo;s role following the referendum result and pending legislative changes, it should be noted that the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 requires the council to, among other things, provide appropriate guidance on all matters relating to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners.  However, it is the role of the postgraduate training bodies to set clinical guidelines.  The Medical Council sets out ethical guidelines for registered medical practitioners in its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners, the current or eighth edition of which was published in 2016.  This guide is regularly reviewed and updated when there is a relevant change in legislation.  Section 48 of the 2016 edition details guidance on doctor&rsquo;s actions around abortion.  However, the guidance currently relates to the situation prior to the referendum result and will need to be adjusted and updated in the context of upcoming changes in legislation.  Section 49 of the current guide puts forward guidance for conscientious objection from a doctor.  This section is also of a particular relevance to the changes in legislation and will also be reviewed and updated as appropriate.  Sections 48 and 49 of the guide and a full copy of the guidance were provided to the committee as supplementary information in advance of this meeting.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council term of 2018 to 2023 has recently begun and reviewing the ethical guide in light of the referendum results was a key item on the agenda for the first meeting.  During this first meeting, the council came to the decision to establish a working group to review the guide as there are sections which will need to be updated or changed following the referendum result.  The procedure for a section of the Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners to be updated would normally be for a council committee or working group to review relevant information relating to the topic, be it research or new legislation, consult with key stakeholders and then draft guidance on the matter.  Once the council is happy with the draft wording, further targeted consultation would normally take place and any feedback would then be taken into consideration.  Final proposed guidance would then be brought to the full Medical Council meeting to be decided on.  This ethical guidance from the Medical Council is for the use of doctors and should be followed in conjunction with the clinical guidelines set out by the postgraduate training bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council is happy to keep the members of the Joint Committee on Health updated throughout the process.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address members today.  We are happy to address any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Suzanne Crowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Crowe.

The ICGP acknowledges that changes that will be required by the outcome of the May 2018 referendum on the repeal of the 8th amendment.  As a result of the referendum outcome, a patient centred clinical care pathway for termination of pregnancy as part of a comprehensive reproductive and sexual health service that is appropriately resourced will be required in Ireland.  The proposed legislation on this matter needs to be accompanied by measures and policies which aim to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy and provide support for those who experience it, including comprehensive contraceptive services and sexual health education programmes.<\/p> <p>  The result of this referendum has created a new reality.  What has principally changed is that terminations of pregnancy which were previously undertaken in another jurisdiction will now be carried out in Ireland.  How this is done, the standards and quality of care, the legal implications and the supports given to women at a difficult time is of concern to all of us.  As healthcare professionals, it is imperative that we engage to ensure a safe and workable outcome.  Our college needs to be part of designing the service and we would like to do so with our colleagues in the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.<\/p> <p>  More detailed information is needed to inform legislators and to enable the Department of Health, together with the postgraduate training bodies and the representative bodies, to comprehensively draw up the detail and resourcing of services for those with unwanted pregnancies.  Whichever model of care is developed, the patient must be front and centre in the required clinical care pathway.  To ensure the delivery of safe, high quality and timely services to our patients, a series of critically interconnected elements will clearly need to be in place.<\/p><p>These will include the following: legislation; clinical guidelines and clinical care pathways; the licensing of appropriate medications; secondary care referral pathways clearly delineated and resourced; community-based opt-in provision; clarification regarding medical indemnity, if there is any; Medical Council guidelines; and a 24-hour helpline that includes a clear referral pathway to a known community provider, referral to in-person counselling, if required, expert advice to pre and post-termination expectations of care and complications and triage out-of-hours advice to address patient concerns and side effects, post-procedure, with onward referral to medical follow-up, if that were to be required.<\/p><p> This opening statement summarises the work, which may change as new evidence arises, required to address the pertinent concerns such as ultrasound and blood typing, and it summarises key elements of a clinical care pathway.  Termination of pregnancy will be legalised for the first time in Ireland.  Few clinicians are trained to deliver this clinical care pathway, unless they received training outside this jurisdiction.  Naturally, this leads to concerns about patient safety in community-based provision of this new service.  To address these concerns, and to generate solutions in the design of a termination of pregnancy service, the college undertook an electronic member engagement process, which does not close until the end of this week.<\/p><p> We have received some good and innovative suggestions for how a service might be offered.  Clinical guidelines need to capture the full clinical care pathway from initial appointment to follow-up care post-termination.  Clinical guidelines would map to the expected legislation and would undergo the usual best-practice rigorous review process in the college.  GPs would prefer an opt-in mechanism by which they choose to provide this clinical care pathway.  Clinical guidelines would be expected to address the totality of care provision, including appropriate means of confirming and dating a pregnancy, medical termination of pregnancy for those at up to nine weeks&rsquo; gestation, consideration of the additional complexities of providing medical termination of pregnancy at up to 12 weeks&rsquo; gestation, and secondary referral to hospital care where required in complex cases or cases where there is uncertainty about dates, known risk factors, etc.  Following discussion of all the options available to her, the final decision about whether to undergo a medical or surgical termination of pregnancy should be the woman&rsquo;s own choice and the appropriate informed consent obtained.<\/p><p> The evidence base on the need for administration of anti-D and the need for ultrasound scanning is becoming clearer and the guidelines would clarify these issues.  If ultrasound is required, rapid access to this facility, including the expert provision and interpretation of sonographs, will be a critical element of the pathway.  A 24-hour helpline, staffed by appropriately trained clinical staff will be required.  This helpline will serve a dual purpose, namely, to provide immediate access to clinical information and care to those with a crisis pregnancy who are considering termination, and to provide post-termination assistance to answer specific questions and make onward referral for care as indicated.  Whether GPs wish to provide this service, college members have expressed concerns regarding capacity and resourcing challenges such as staffing, facilities and training; the potential lack of appropriate specialist support; the possibility of medical complications for their patients; the public reaction for those who choose to provide and those who do not choose to provide this clinical care pathway; and a fear of litigation.  They wish to see an acknowledgement of conscientious objection and how to accommodate this in the care pathway, and an acknowledgement of conscientious commitment and how to support this in the care pathway.  There needs to be an integrated and resourced contraceptive service, provided to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancies.  They want clinical care pathways to keep the patient central to the service and be free at the point of care.  They have concerns about the remuneration for service providers and desire a commitment from the Department of Health to a timeline within which a woman can expect to receive a service.<\/p><p> This is a significant juncture in medical care in Ireland.  We have an opportunity to ensure the provision of a safe, best-practice, appropriately resourced, patient-centred termination of pregnancy clinical care pathway.  The ICGP looks forward to playing a significant role in the development of this pathway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>We welcome the opportunity to address the committee and to discuss the matter of clinical guidelines being prepared in light of the impending introduction of abortion services in Ireland.  The IOG is the national professional and training body for obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland.  Members of the institute are drawn from all 19 maternity hospitals and units throughout the country.  In April this year, the IOG set up a number of working groups to establish principles to underpin the development of guidelines for legislation for abortion services in Ireland in the event of successful repeal of the eighth amendment.  More than 50 members of the institute volunteered to participate in the development of guidelines.  Members have visited units in Scotland, England and Norway where abortion care is integrated into the health system.  Clearly, the legislative process is not yet complete, so the IOG working groups are drafting guidelines on the basis of what has been proposed to date by the Minister of Health.  Guidelines will be completed when the final legislation is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The following workstreams have been established: early pregnancy; threat to life and health of the mother; fetal medicine; conscientious objection; and staff training. I will comment on the some of the general principles that we are following.  To deliver fit-for-purpose services for termination of pregnancy in Ireland, the institute recommends that services should be free to all at the point of delivery and funding for the service, as with all women&rsquo;s healthcare, should be appropriately resourced and ring-fenced.  International experience, supported by data, is that following legalisation of abortion services, numbers decline with the passage of time for a variety of reasons, including the removal of barriers to access and when the service includes advice on, and provision of, contraception.  The IOG, therefore, strongly supports the proposals of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and the Minister for Health&rsquo;s proposal that every effort should be made to reduce crisis pregnancies, including by the provision of free contraception.<\/p> <p>  Early pregnancy is defined as the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, that is 12 weeks after the woman&rsquo;s last menstrual period and, on average, ten weeks post-conception.  We have looked to the example of Scotland, a country with a similar population to Ireland, for data on termination services.  In Scotland, approximately 75% of terminations are at less than nine weeks and 91% of these are medically induced.  Approximately 10% require hospital attendance because of complications.  We believe that Irish figures should be in line with those of Scotland.<\/p> <p>  In line with international best practice, it is proposed that early medical abortion, at less than nine weeks' pregnancy, takes place in the community.  Although routine pre-termination ultrasound scanning is not recommended as mandatory in international guidelines, it is performed in most circumstances where it is readily available, and always if there are concerns about dates or ectopic pregnancy, or if the woman chooses.  In Ireland, however, we are only too well aware of the well-documented infrastructural deficits in access to ultrasound in pregnancy.  Introduction of a termination service without adequate scanning facilities is fraught with risk, and the IOG, therefore, recommends that appropriate and immediate investment in ultrasound is an integral element of termination services.  After nine weeks, and before 12 completed weeks, it is recommended that medical termination takes place in the hospital setting due to the increased risk of complications such as bleeding.  It is likely that a proportion of women will choose a surgical option for practical reasons.  Risks and benefits of both methods will be explained.<\/p> <p>  The IOG recommends that a 24-7 helpline be established to help with appointments, provide reassurance, and provide information if a woman is concerned about any aspect of her care such as where to go in the case of a complication.  The proposed three-day interval between the first consultation and initiating the termination is not supported by evidence; it may act as a barrier and it makes unwarranted assumptions about women&rsquo;s ability to make their own decisions.  There is evidence that those who request termination remain satisfied with their decision.  A waiting time, if any, should be from the time of first contact with the service.<\/p> <p>  Contraceptive advice and services, including long-acting options, should be available at the time of the termination.  Blood tests for anaemia, blood group and HCG, if appropriate, should be taken at the time of first consultation.  It may also be appropriate to test for sexually transmitted infections in certain circumstances.  On the threat to life or health of the pregnant woman, any woman whose life is at risk or where there is a serious risk to her health will be in hospital already.  Since the introduction of the Protection of Life in Pregnancy Act in 2013, experience has been gained in the performance of termination in hospitals and, therefore, current practice need not alter.<\/p> <p>  Foetal medicine and termination for a lethal foetal abnormality will take place in hospitals.  The medical procedures will be the same as for those performed for the risk to life or health.  It is envisaged that medical management with Mifepristone and Misoprostol will treat the majority of cases.<\/p><p>Termination for foetal abnormality currently takes place outside the State.  Diagnosis in Ireland is almost exclusively based on ultrasound.  In the United States and Europe, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is the standard of care.  It is useful in complex anomalies to confirm or exclude pathologies suggested by ultrasound.  MRI results can change a diagnosis from fatal to life limiting and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The overall diagnostic accuracy of MRI is 93% compared to 68% for ultrasound.  Thus, when MRI is used, further to initial ultrasound, additional information is provided in 50% of cases, the diagnosis is changed in 35% of cases, medical management is changed in 33% of cases and prognosis is changed in 20% of cases.  MRI is currently only available in one maternity hospital in the country.  The IOG recommends funding to expand access to foetal MRI.  <br\/><br\/>The Medical Council has clear guidelines on conscientious objection.  In section 49 of the current guide - I will not read it out - if a doctor has a conscientious objection to treatment then he or she has a duty to transfer care to another doctor.  In an emergency there is no option but to give care.  We see no reason to change these guidelines but we understand that the Medical Council is looking at them.  Section 50 deals with current termination services in Ireland and will need to be updated once the legislative process relating to abortion is completed.  We draw attention to the fact that the document on the professional refusal to provide abortion care on grounds of conscientious objection and European human rights jurisprudence on State obligations to guarantee women's access to legal reproductive healthcare has a human rights perspective.  It states that, at a minimum, the State must ensure the adequate availability and dispersal of willing providers, prohibit institutional refusal of care, establish effective referral systems, disseminate information on legal entitlements to abortion care, impose clear limits on the legality of refusals and implement adequate monitoring oversight and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with relevant regulations.<br\/><br\/>We want to be sure that the system is not set up to fail as we have seen already with other systems.  On staff training, the institute has already begun organising courses for staff training on techniques not currently performed in Ireland and education on abortion care is being introduced into postgraduate training programmes for doctors.  I understand that it will also be introduced into undergraduate programmes.  A separate educational programme based on conscience and values is recommended for all whether directly involved in abortion care or not.  Abortion care in Ireland will be a significant change for all healthcare professionals.  In view of this, we recommend the establishment of an abortion provider's network to include nurses and midwives who will be integral to the delivery of woman centred care.  I thank the committee and will be happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Boylan.  To start, I would like to ask two questions.  On the heads of the general scheme of the Bill, published in July of this year, which is the only document that we have to work on at the moment because we do not have the legislation yet, in head 7 in relation to early pregnancy, there is a requirement that the medical practitioner forms an opinion in good faith that the pregnancy concerned is not in excess of 12 weeks.  Is Dr. Boylan making a distinction between nine weeks and 12 weeks in that after nine weeks it should occur in a hospital setting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Yes, that is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>The second part of the question is on the three day period from initial consultation to confirming that the woman wants to proceed with her termination.

Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Yes, it is.  I will address head 7 on nine and 12 weeks first of all.  Beyond nine weeks the rate of complication such as bleeding and perhaps a need for surgical completion increases and, therefore, it is not appropriate that should be carried out in the community.  Most of the early terminations, in fact the vast majority, will take place in the woman's own home, in her own environment wherever she wishes to be.  That is not appropriate if there is a high rate of complications from a patient safety point of view and so from nine to 12 weeks women will require hospital management.  That raises the question of ultrasound as a dating mechanism.  Figures vary but in Scotland, for example, about 30% of women will require a scan for uncertain dates and it will probably be something similar here.  We have to be very careful in this country when introducing this service that there are no hiccups or adverse outcomes so we recommend that the majority of women would have access to an ultrasound scan if necessary or if the doctor feels that it is necessary.  That will require a significant beefing up of ultrasound availability to doctors working in the community and to doctors in general.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the three day waiting period, there is not really any evidence that it is necessary.  There are mixed opinions about it obviously and in some countries in Europe, the Netherlands for example, there is a waiting period between the time of first consultation and the actual termination of pregnancy.  There is not, however, any evidence that it is necessary and it also makes presumptions about women's ability to make decisions about their own healthcare.  We have heard much about paternalism and attitudes to women recently in light of the CervicalCheck problems so while there will be mixed views about it, many doctors feel that it is not in fact absolutely necessary and perhaps should be dropped.  That is, however, a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Boylan.

Between nine weeks and 12 weeks, as Dr. Boylan has said, complications become more problematic and there are more dating issues.  We will need a very careful well elaborated pathway.  When we talk about clinical care pathways we mean how to plot the journey a woman takes from the beginning through to the end of a service so that there is an expectation by the clinician providing the care of what that service will be.  When we talk about guidance and clinical guidance we mean that we set up a section, a written education reference structure, so that clinicians can understand what they are doing.  We will need careful clinical guidance, which we would develop with the institute, we will need very careful clinical care pathways and we will need significant resourcing.  Before nine weeks we would expect to be in a community setting, between nine weeks and 12 weeks with the significant support of the hospitals or entirely hospital based and after 12 weeks it would be in the hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Will there have to be significant integration between the primary care and secondary care in respect of how the patient moves smoothly from one service to the other?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Yes, that would be critical to success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Favier.

The opening statements were very useful.  I want to ask all three groups about timing.  This a complex issue.  It is the first time we have done this in Ireland and there is much complexity involved for all three organisations.  The Medical Council needs to work through the ethical guidelines carefully.  By my count there were about six steps in the process between stakeholder reviews, drafts, integrating feedback, coming back together and finally publishing.  That is a comprehensive process.  The steps outlined for GPs are wideranging.  There is legislation, which we will all work on together, there are care pathways from primary to secondary, there is licensing of medications and availability of medications, there are 24-hour helplines, there is some way for people to opt in or out, whatever way it ends up, there is clarification on medical indemnity, which is obviously a hot topic at the moment, there are Medical Council guidelines and so on.  There is an awful lot.<\/p><p>Some GPs and obstetricians I have spoken with recently are very worried about the amount of work to be done within the timetable that has been stated by the Government which is that this would be operational on the ground by January.  The Medical Council is clearly putting a lot of time into making sure that this works for women in Ireland.<\/p><p> The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has laid out various issues as well.  The question I have for the institute is firstly the same question, namely how confident is it that things are progressing in such a way that this could be operational on the ground, to the standards required by January, which is the current goal.  Second, specifically on the infrastructure required in hospital or community settings, the institute has made the point that additional diagnostics are required such as ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, MRI.  Does it have a sense yet of what we are talking about?  Is it five new MRI scanners and doubling ultrasound capacity for example?  I ask the institute and the ICGP what other capacity constraints are out there.  Diagnostics have been mentioned.  When this is up and running, do the witnesses foresee capacity constraints in terms of not having enough GPs?  As we all know, GPs are under huge pressure at the moment.  Do the witnesses foresee not having enough consultants, obstetricians, operating theatres, acute beds or post termination supports for the women?

The first one he raised was the question of the timeline and we were all aware that the Minister has it in mind that the service would commence in the beginning of January.  There are three work streams involved in this process.  There is the legislation, which will be the responsibility of the Oireachtas.  There are the structural implications, that is to say the provision of services either within secondary care or within primary care and the pathways that have been spoken about, where a woman needs a particular course of action to be taken - will that be there for that woman in an expeditious way?  All of that needs to be worked out and to date we are not that far advanced in that side of things.  On the ICGP, our role in this will involve the production of guidelines and the education of our members and we have done considerable work on our guidelines to date but they will intersect with the legislation and with the structural arrangements that will be put in place.  In order for us to finalise that we need to have some knowledge of what else is happening in the three work streams.<\/p> <p>  Education will be another part.  This is a new service being introduced which we have not had in Ireland before.  We said in our statement that people will be unfamiliar and will need guidelines and educational input to reinforce that.  We will probably do that in a web-based fashion but we also have an infrastructure of study groups around the country.  Our continuing medical education, CME, group infrastructure which the committee might be aware of, where GPs gather together and discuss issues will probably be used.  We will also probably be looking to roll out more regional presentations as well so all of this will be a rolling process.  Whether we will have enough time for all of this between now and January is the question.

The Deputy will be aware that 60% of practices are now closed to new patients.  He will also be aware that there is a demographic cliff in general practice in that the National Doctors Training and Planning, NDTP, which is the HSE unit for planning, estimates that we will be down 700 GPs in seven years so there are major problems.  GPs will also be looking quite critically at what the Deputy spoke about in terms of the infrastructure that surrounds them and the care pathways that will flow from general practice because they do not want to be in a position where they have embarked on a process with a woman and that they are not carrying that to an expeditious completion because of bottlenecks in the system, waiting times for ultrasound or waiting times for consultant provision.

That needs to happen soon so that we can get a clear picture of what the requirements are in infrastructural deficits that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  On the MRI, in reality it is only used in cases of foetal abnormality in order to clarify what the diagnosis is so it is only relevant in those particular circumstances.

The MRI machine in the National Maternity Hospital, with some jiggling around, could possibly be a national centre for referral to clarify the diagnosis for women and pregnancies where there are foetal abnormalities.  The consequences of getting it wrong are serious.  We could end up with a termination done for a condition that is not fatal or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It is not an issue at the moment because women have to travel abroad and in many circumstances, or most, when they go abroad, they will have an MRI before having a termination of pregnancy.  That is something that has not been relevant in this country and it will not be until legislation is introduced and practice is changed.  That would require some investment but it is not madly expensive.  It just requires a jiggling around of consultant sessions, etc.<br\/><br\/>On ultrasound, there clearly are capacity constraints and we are all aware of those so that needs to be addressed.

Implementation is a much larger process and, as Dr. Boylan said, up to now much work has been done in silos.  Many stakeholders and I feel we would be better off sitting down together and contributing on the implementation process.  From speaking to clinicians on the ground, different hospitals may have different capacity constraints.  In particular, we are trying to anticipate what surgical capacity will be required in hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The narrative in the media up to now has been about the provision of services for the medical termination of pregnancy.  A large proportion, however, certainly between nine and 12 weeks, may well be surgical.  People may choose to have a surgical termination and there are also family reasons why they might do so, such as if they had children at home or workplace issues, etc.  We need, therefore, to anticipate the provision of services in our hospitals.  There is good evidence that provision of surgical terminations needs to be integrated into women's healthcare in hospitals.  We are not looking for separate buildings or separate capacity but we have to be creative in looking at our current deficits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>On the capacity issue, is the institute aware of the HSE, the Department or any other bodies doing a mapping exercise to identify where the constraint issues are hospital by hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#K00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>We have had two meetings with the Department of Health.

My first question is that 1 January is going to come quickly and the witnesses have all rehearsed some of the difficulties.  We know that there are three pillars - legislation, guidelines and infrastructure and resources.  Have all of the relevant stakeholders been in the same room together at any point to have that important conversation or are we only at the stage of drafting up the plan for where we might all get into a room together?  On the roll-out of services for primary care, we hear much about that and that the preference is for primary and community care.  Are we talking about family planning clinics, Well Woman centres and integrating all of the services that exist or is it only just GPs who have been involved in this up to this date?  In respect of the 24-hour helpline, information line or whatever, have the witnesses given any consideration to who might staff that, who they would work for and how that would work?  My sense is that could end up as a crisis line.  A non-clinical person or a non-trained person could not be on that line because the purpose is to direct women towards a clinical pathway.<\/p> <p>  The ICGP made reference in its submission to specialist support that might be necessary.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of that?  We are talking about 1 January and we need to understand if that is realistic.  We do not need to say in the middle of December that we mentioned specialist support and here is the list of what that looks like.  This question is most likely for the IOG but perhaps others might have a view as well.<\/p><p>I am a bit mystified about where the three-day waiting period came from.  It did not form a large part of our discussions at the eighth amendment committee.  I understand it is the practice in some jurisdictions.  I am interested in the views of all of the witnesses as to whether it is wholly necessary and, if it is deemed to be necessary, and we must be guided by clinicians on this, can the waiting period count from the first contact with the helpline or information line?  Do the witnesses envisage that it would work like that?  I will put my cards on the table and state I am not convinced that a three-day waiting period is necessary but it has been flagged.<\/p><p> My final question relates to the duty to transfer a patient where there is a conscientious objection.  My understanding from the presentations is that such a duty to transfer exists already.  I am interested if there are any plans to change that.  If consideration is being given to that, the witnesses might enlighten us as to why or how it will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#K01500","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman.

Today has helped to bring together the various components that must be put in place.  It is a jigsaw that must be put together by January and then monitored continuously.  We can all see that is going to be quite difficult but it must be done.<\/p> <p>  The presentations were very well put together on what needs to happen in the pre-nine weeks, nine to 12 weeks and post-12 weeks cases.  While we can see the care pathways, there are issues in respect of interaction between GP services and primary care services and even geographical coverage, in south Kerry or north Donegal, for example.  Issues will arise there.  How can we ensure that provisional pathways are put in place to ensure that all those points are covered?  What analysis is being done between the groups represented here working with the Department?  I will return to those two meetings or non-meetings.  What analysis is being done on this?  No one can tell me that we have universal coverage or that there will be a universal coverage map based on the pathways as outlined.  When I look around the country, I know that they do not exist and this will be even more the case in this regard.  What work is being done?  If no work has been done on it yet, the witnesses should be upfront and say so, because then we have a serious issue because we will have to solve it in the next 12 weeks.  There is an interconnection between GPs, primary care setting and hospital settings and there are gaps there.  How will we address that?  <\/p> <p>  My second question is connected to that and relates to the meetings with the Department.  I do not think that a lot happened at those meetings by the sounds of things.  I do not want to put Dr. Murphy on the spot but the Department of Health needs to drive this but, with the best will in the world, it does not come across to me that it is doing so.<\/p><p>I do not want to overlap with the issues that have been outlined by previous speakers.  Where are those issues in the discussions that have taken place?  Where is the issue I have just raised?  Is a plan being put in place?  Have the witnesses seen evidence that a plan is being put in place?  Maybe they can elaborate on what was discussed at the two meetings.  How much progress has been made on foot of those meetings?<\/p><p> In moving on to my third question, I will not ask about the three-week rule and the infrastructure in hospitals.  I respect what everyone has said about the Medical Council guidelines.  In some scenarios, GPs deliberately act in a manner that does not involve referring people on, or camouflages the way in which that happens.  We all know about the issues with clinicians that have arisen recently and have been considered by Dr. Scally.  We will talk about them in the D&aacute;il later.  How are we going to make sure such issues do not happen?  Where they do happen, how can we ensure they can be dealt with quickly?  The issue of geographical coverage arises again in this context.  When doctors behave in a certain manner, how can we deal with that clinically and quickly?  That is my third question.<\/p><p> The fourth question I would like to raise is a quick one.  I presume the witnesses support the concept of a 24-hour helpline.

Concerns jump out to me regarding the latter.  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on private provision?  I have not fully worked out my thoughts on it.  It seems that where there is private provision, there are concerns in respect of aftercare.  There are also concerns about knowledge that is not being garnered or put into the public setting, and the gaps of information because of that.  I suppose it is possible that some individuals will be targeted if they are just in a private setting.  I have asked five questions, some of which overlap.

We have not been in a position to do a mapping exercise on the numbers because we do not know what we are mapping against in terms of the legislation or the guidelines.  Some innovative suggestions have been made.  There is good international evidence that this problem can be solved in various ways, for example involving mobile provision.  A service run by a family planning clinic or another GP could be provided in a local area once a month, for example.  These are just suggestions.  Someone who rings a helpline could be sent to a provider in another area.  A person in a small town should be able to find a provider without having to run the gauntlet of trying to find somebody.  One of the main ways of addressing this issue will have to involve the Department of Health giving a commitment to a timeline that creates an expectation relating to when care will be delivered.  Women who have tried without success to access the service will have to be able to ring the helpline and ask for help in accessing it.  We do not have answers because the process is just starting.  There is a great deal of international evidence for ways of deal with this issue.  Countries like Australia and Canada have expertise of service provision in remote areas.

There is a duty on objecting physicians to ensure continuity of care, but some of them are falling short of that standard.  As the<i>ex post facto<\/i>regulator in this area, the Medical Council is responsible for dealing with complaints that are made to it and for taking action when it becomes aware of cases in which people are falling short of the prevailing standards.  The Act provides for the confidential process that must be followed when a complaint is made.  It sets out a comprehensive procedure that must take place, and there has to be a full investigation.  All procedural norms must be recognised.  Due process and the constitutional rights of the practitioner have to be preserved.  There must be a full process.  The Medical Council is responsible for making a determination in the context of all the evidence that is presented.  Each case is judged on its merits.  As the regulator, we are in a difficult position.  We do not want to prejudge any particular case.  Every doctor is entitled to a full process and to an open procedure.  The guidelines for conscientious objection and open disclosure specify that there is a strong duty to ensure continuity of care, to act in the best interests of patients and to provide full disclosure.  If, having considered all the standards, we believe someone is falling short, the Medical Council can impose a list of sanctions, including advice, admonishment and censure and, in more severe cases, suspension and erasure, which means the doctor no longer has the right to practice.  This is the role of the Medical Council as the <i>ex post facto<\/i>regulator.

Abortion provision, especially between nine and 12 weeks, is not a highly technical procedure, even in cases of surgical abortion.

We have listened to our colleagues and we have close connections with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, in England.  Their experience is much greater than ours and because of a difficulty providing the service in the public setting, outsourcing to private providers took place.  Subsequent difficulties arose with a lack of training in the public setting and with variation in standards so we do not want to go down that route.  Also, international evidence shows that data and monitoring are very important.  If the service is spread between private and public, it will not lead to an improvement in standards.  We envisage rolling out a service and there may be changes in how that is delivered over three or five years, as more information is obtained.

Senator Dolan started from the very important premise of trusting women.  As general practitioners, patient-centred care and keeping women and anybody who can become pregnant at the heart of that care are about trusting the patient and, in this scenario, trusting women.  Starting from a premise of patient-centred care, we are left with trying to support women who face crisis and unwanted pregnancies no matter what decision they may make.<\/p> <p>  From a conscientious commitment point of view, that language has come into the literature to recognise that there is a moral judgment involved in the imperative to provide care in these scenarios when women face these crises.  A significant majority of Irish people voted to change the legislation in the referendum and general practitioners and doctors are no different from the general population.  If anything, they have a more informed position because they see women in these unwanted pregnancies and the extraordinary lengths they have gone to in order to raise money and leave the country.  It was because it was unsafe that the position was changed and the Irish people voted for that change.<\/p> <p>  There has been a serious chilling effect in medicine because we have not been able to talk about abortion and it has been actively discouraged and criminalised.  For those reasons, we have found it difficult to have these conversations.  They are only starting and all of us are on a journey in the sense of clarifying and setting our values.  We have a deadline of 1 January but it will take some time in Irish society, particularly in the medical fraternity, to explore these issues further.

This is also related to what he said about the distribution of the availability of general practice.  As he will be aware, in rural lists the HSE is finding it very difficult to find any doctor to take up the GMS lists.  The Senator is right that the distribution of doctors is more favourable in wealthier areas than in poorer areas and that is a very large problem.  We are currently dealing with a specific area, namely, abortion, but general practice is comprehensive.  It deals with all people and all problems so anything that is causing a failure of general practice will impinge on any discussion, including this one.<\/p><p>Currently, as a country we spend a little bit less than 4% of the national health spend on general practice, which is about half of what the UK provides, and we expect it to be the same.  In terms of numbers of GPs per head of population, we have about half of what Australia and Canada have.  They would be two popular destinations for GPs who are emigrating.  While I am on that subject, we have research with regard to what is happening with our trained GPs, and it now appears that 20% of the GPs who are trained here go away and stay away.  We spend a great deal as a country training those GPs and they are leaving for reasons including lifestyle, career progression and the capacity to do what they are trained to do.<\/p><p> I know members are sick of people coming in to say they do not have enough money, and to be honest, I am sick of saying it, but I still draw their attention to the base rate figures which are what percentage of the health spend goes on general practice and what they expect as a result of that.  It is impinging upon the new service but it will impinge on every discussion.  I have been before the committee for discussions on mental health and it impinges on it in exactly the same way.  It is disappointing from our perspective because we feel passionately about the value the general practice provides to people in local communities and day-to-day lives.<\/p><p> To return to the Senator's original question on how it is going to impact and if we have a plan B, I think it is going to impact on the new service.  I cannot quantify the impact but, inevitably, what is going on in general practice has to have an impact on the delivery and roll-out of the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Is there a plan B?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#O00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I do not know if there is even a plan A.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>With regard to MRI scans, as I explained to Deputy Donnelly, it really relates to foetal abnormalities and making sure the diagnosis is correct.

There is almost an assumption that these are new women who did not exist before, that the ten or 12 each day who will land out of the sky are additional and have never approached a GPs surgery.  I remember evidence to the committee said that most of the women are already attending their GPs for contraception, cervical smears and so on, so they are pre-existing patients.  That does not seem to have entered the conversation.  I know it is a new service, but these women already exist.<\/p> <p>  There has been comment about the interaction between the GP and secondary care.  However, maternity care is universal in this country.  My understanding is that relationship between the GP and the secondary care provider is already established.  There was a conversation earlier about how we would do this.  Is communication between the two deficient?  Will the GPs and the secondary care providers outline the problems we might encounter?<\/p> <p>  If we had 12 cases of anything else a day which had to go abroad or source illegal medication online, it would be a national scandal and a bundle of money would be liberated for it immediately.  If the men of Ireland had to travel on a Ryanair flight they would be up in arms and out roaring and shouting outside the D&aacute;il.  This is something we have never provided in this country but it is not a novel provision.  It is essential medicine.  The committee heard that at length and we heart the World Health Organization's stance on it.  Despite recent mutterings about overspends in health, I believe this is a separate bundle.  It is long over due to the women of Ireland.  I advise whoever writes the cheque to just do so.<\/p> <p>  The three-day wait was discussed at length at the committee.  Some of those present here have a problem with it from the perspective of trusting women.

We should be able to manage it.<\/p> <p>  We discussed the ring-fencing of funding in a maternity strategy where the constant drag of women's health and gynaecological issues are just not a priority and women are expected to get over it and deal with their prolapsed whatever until a time comes when someone deems they can have an operation.  I would be very supportive of this.  It is a very time-sensitive matter.  Going from eight to ten weeks totally changes someone's situation.  Ring-fencing of budgets in contraception and the termination of pregnancy services is essential to ensure that women are not put at any undue risk.  We heard evidence that the longer a pregnancy goes on and the later the termination, the greater the risk of complication.  Doctors for Choice argued it should be as early as possible. <\/p> <p>  I refer to scanning.  People are already taking abortion pills in this country without scanning.  We had evidence of the complications.  Will witnesses clarify if it was 20% of under-nine weeks where there were surgical complications or is it less than that?  Is it not less than that?  Will the witnesses clarify the complication rate for medical terminations under nine weeks.  Do they have the evidence?  How would any form of ultrasound or MRI in a GPs surgery, or whatever, possibly effect that?  My memory of the evidence is that ultrasound intervention before nine weeks is neither here nor there except in the rare cases of ectopic pregnancy.  <\/p> <p>  I refer to an abortion providers network.  There appears to be agreement on the 24 hour helpline, certainly when a service starts, although I imagine that maybe in ten years time we will not need one.  However, I am seriously concerned at the idea of an abortion providers network.  Any list of providers of this service is ripe for targeting.  I know there is a list of pharmacists who provide the morning after pill.  Somehow I am not on it but my husband is and every so often, we receive a letter along with religious paraphernalia.  There are lists of people who provide things that others object to.  Such a list of providers seems to invite trouble.<\/p> <p>  The eighth amendment committee was very conscious of the service not being provided by a private operator in this country, but that it would be provided as part of the public health service on a universal basis.  I do not know which contributor mentioned the emergence of private care.  The most significant thing we heard this morning was the buy-in from the Department of Health.  Can those who have engaged in this already tell us if their informed view is that a lead needs to be appointed in the Department of Health between now and next June, for example, for the roll out period of perhaps two years?  Do we need a designated official?  We have three Ministers of State in the Department of Health.  Do they believe that someone must be appointed to drive this?  They have clearly said that without leadership it will not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#P00600","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Connell and invite the witnesses to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#P00700","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I will begin with the Deputy's reference to 12 women a day.  What I take this to mean is that with 5,000 people travelling to the UK currently, that works out mathematically as 12 people daily.  That probably underestimates the number of women who are requiring abortion.  My understanding is that it is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000.  In any case, the Deputy's point was that this does not represent an extra burden on practices as these women are already patients of the practice and this service can be fitted in.  The nature of the work that will be involved in this will be time consuming.  It is unlikely that it will fit in to the normal process of a standard GP consultation.<\/p><p>The work is likely to cluster.  It is not likely to be dispersed equally across all GPs.  Some 46% of GPs are female.  I am a male doctor of a certain vintage and when I was a young doctor, I was involved in women's health.  As the years have rolled on, I have seen less of it and almost no women's health issues have come under my remit in recent years.<\/p><p> With regard to the distribution of part-time work, many newer graduates work part-time hours.  This is skewed a bit more towards female GPs who are graduating.  It will not be a question of just 12 a day and it will not be evenly distributed across practices.  As we discussed, there is the matter of provision of GPs.  There are plenty of GPs in more affluent areas of Dublin and fewer GPs in poorer areas.  That competes with all the other unmet need in those areas.  It is not true to say it is just a little more work and to ask why we do not just slip it in.

International evidence suggests that for nine weeks and under, one can expect that approximately 10% of women, one in ten, will need some sort of further support following a medical termination of pregnancy.  That may be purely advice.  This is again where the telephone service comes in.  One might ask if there is too much bleeding and if one should do something, or there might be no bleeding at all and one might ask if that is significant, which it might be, since it might be a failed procedure and further input is needed.  Of that 10%, approximately 10% will need to have further medical input and see a provider, either a doctor or a nurse.  Of those, approximately 10% will need to go into secondary care to have something more done.  That is how it roughly breaks down.  The Deputy is correct that as one progresses through pregnancy, it becomes more common.  Early is always best.  With each week, there is a small percentage rise.  We want to make sure that women are kept at the centre of it and that they get access to a procedure as early as possible, effectively as soon as they make contact, depending on the mandatory waiting period, so that we can keep the complication rate as low as possible.  The further we go, the more the burden on secondary care and requirement of resources for it increases.<\/p> <p>  We generally try to avoid ultrasound scanning in post-termination scenarios in the very first early weeks because one cannot be sure what to do with the results.  Access to it will be critical from a GP point of view where this service applies.  In trying to keep the patient central, GPs would like to see a comprehensive contraception service provided and integrated.  Our best goal is to reduce the rate of crisis pregnancies and we can only do that if we have universal access to contraception, not just universal access to termination of pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Are there figures for the number of GPs who advertise and provide specific women's health services and have, in-house, their own ultrasound machines?

I want to bring the conversation back to the women who are travelling, with over 1,000 having had to do that since we voted in May.  We will never know the exact figure but from studies which have been done on telemedicine providers, up to five people a day in Ireland use abortion pills purchased online.  These are the key people that we need to take into account.  I agree and understand that GPs and doctors need training, infrastructure and resources, it is vital that unnecessary elements are not built in that will further delay women and those who are pregnant from getting the healthcare that they should get in this country.  With that in mind, we should start with safety.  Abortion is a very safe procedure as testified to in the evidence we heard in the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  On abortion pills, I have spent much time researching them because I was involved in helping to distribute them at a time when they were illegal.  There are more deaths from wisdom tooth extraction than there are from using the abortion pill.  People may have an impression that abortion is highly dangerous and has many requirements.  It is safer than Viagra.  It is probably safer than antibiotics with regard to reactions because people have reactions to antibiotics.  I make these points because there seems to be a layer of bureaucracy that has been talked about being built in to the provision of abortion.  Adverse outcomes are very rare.  I respect the doctors and the studies that they have done but studies have been done on women in Ireland, who have used an abortion pill purchased online, by Women on Web, which is the biggest provider internationally.<\/p><p>Dr. Abigail Aiken testified that less than 3% required any medical follow-up, and this tended to be either antibiotics or a blood transfusion.  A really extreme adverse outcome was rare.  That was in the case of early use of the abortion pill and is in a study published in <i>The Lancet<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>I was very glad to hear Dr. Favier state early scans in a GP surgery would not be necessary because we can imagine how long that would take.  I have read very recent studies from 2015 and 2016 that show they are not required for early pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>I want to speak about the 24-hour helpline.  I would love 24-hour helplines for many issues.  We do not even have 24-hour helplines for domestic violence because we do not have the money.  Is this also something that is not really necessary?  If the service will be provided, and I completely reject the idea of opting in, it should be a normal part of healthcare.  It should not be abnormal that a doctor opts in.  It goes against the grain of everything people voted for to introduce opting in and making the service abnormal.  People should be able to go to their GP and have a discussion.  This is what everyone spoke about in the referendum campaign.<br\/><br\/>The waiting period is another issue.  I reread the committee report, and I stand to be corrected, but I do not see much, or any, reference to it.  Absolutely, it was referred to during the committee's deliberations but there is no medical need for it.  The doctors have just said this and it is what the WHO told the committee.  We all know it was put in as a sop so Deputies could say there are restrictions on women.  Let us be honest.  The WHO told us it is dangerous because it inhibits access for people who are poor or victims of violence.  A woman with other children would have to go for a second appointment.  It looks like this is what will happen but it is not really required.  One appointment should be enough.  If we build in a waiting period, will a woman have to take the first pill in the doctor's surgery?  This is not necessary.  People are taking it with guidance online and they can take it with guidance from their GP.  It would enforce barriers and would mean the most vulnerable women will have time added on.  It is paternalistic.  We do not have a waiting period for anything else.  We do not have a mandatory waiting period for a vasectomy.  It might be recommended to the person to go away and think about it but it is not written into law.  It would be really dangerous for this to be enshrined in legislation rather than being left up to a doctor to tell someone she needs to think about it.<br\/><br\/>My next question is on health and I ask the doctors before the committee to comment.  There is a difference between what the committee on the eighth amendment recommended and what is in the legislation and I am quite concerned about this.  In the committee's report people were at pains to make sure, based on all of the evidence from doctors themselves, that what health was would not be nailed down in law.  The general recommendation was to include reference to risk to health but what we actually have is reference to serious harm.  There is a difference between these two things.  This is a deviation from what we discussed in the committee and it should be opposed.  There would be no consultation with the pregnant person at the centre of it, which is highly paternalistic.  It is not even mentioned that the view of the pregnant person on what is the risk to her should be a factor in the final decision.  It is completely up to two doctors.  I respect doctors but they are not infallible.  The person should have a say.  If a doctor is in a situation where somebody is outside of the 12 week range we would still have criminalisation.  This can have a chilling effect on doctors, as can reference to serious harm rather than reference to risk to health.  Will the doctors comment on why these different responses are included?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#Q01400","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>With regard to the safety issue, we are not trying to overdo the risks of early medical termination.  What we are trying to emphasise is that we would like the service rolled out to be fit for purpose and that there would be no cost-cutting in this area so we would not be trying to do it in another area.  We are fully on board with trying to deliver this service.  Our members just want the appropriate backup and resourcing so we are able to cope with women who need to go to hospital.  My apologies if it was interpreted as us overemphasising certain areas.<\/p> <p>  We see the 24-hour helpline as a signpost for people.  There could be situations where a patient does not want to go to her local hospital or GP.  A helpline may provide advice on other appropriate centres.  There may be many advantages to such a helpline.  We and the other clinical groups felt it might be helpful.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's points on the waiting period are well taken.  As far as I understand, it will lead to an extra visit and that could be difficult, particularly for someone travelling from one area to another, perhaps to another community practice.  It would be a particular difficulty for somebody on the margins of the 12 week limit.  If someone at 11 weeks and three days needed to wait three days that would be obstruction, and there is international evidence to state it forms obstruction.  I will mention New Zealand, which has a waiting period and a very liberal interpretation of conscientious objection.  This has led to weeks of waiting for women and we should try not to go in that direction.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the change from \"risk to health\" to \"serious harm\", the Deputy has highlighted that issues in medicine are not black and white.  Certainly we have advocated publicly on the need for the patient's voice to be heard in complex medical decisions regarding her health and pregnancy.  Good practice would involve a multidisciplinary team meeting the two practitioners but good practice would also take into account the woman's experience, her social circumstances and her other children.  We do not legislate for this but certainly it would be good practice.  We already do this in other areas of maternal medicine.<\/p> <p>  With regard to criminalisation, it is something that has been advocated against worldwide.

It certainly is challenging for women when they find out they are pregnant and the clock starts ticking in a very real way.  It is challenging for the women who are taking the pill today, as Deputies Coppinger and O'Connell have described.  It is estimated that 1,000 women will be travelling to the UK, which has been going on for years.  We waited 35 years for what happened yesterday; the timeline is certainly challenging but some 66.4% voted for change.  Given that time is of the essence for women, how can we as legislators work with colleagues in the colleges to make sure that there is no undue delay, for example in the drawing up of the guidelines that Dr. O'Brien mentioned?  Do we need some formality on that?<\/p> <p>  Going back to the three-day interval, Dr. Boylan and Dr. Murphy clearly said in their paper that it is not supported by evidence, so surely there is a case that it should not be in the law.

That is a planning issue to do with the HSE and the Department of Health.  It will also be important that this is sufficiently resourced; ring-fencing of the resources has been mentioned already.  There is also a whole question around capacity and actually providing the people, equipment, buildings and beds to deliver this service both in primary care and within the hospital system itself.

For instance, in Portugal, where they do not have any mandatory waiting period, it is written into their regulations that they must receive a service within five days.  In Holland, where they do have a mandatory waiting time, that waiting time starts from the moment the women picks up the phone.  It would give great reassurance to us as potential providers to know that the Department has our back and that there will be provision within a certain timeframe.  It is not for us to suggest what that timeframe would be but this is a particularly timebound issue, unique in medicine.  As the Senator said, the clock starts to tick for women, but unfortunately it is going to start to tick for providers, too.  We are going to be faced with the additional burden and responsibility of how to shepherd women through these clinical care pathways.  Who is responsible for them if the pathways fail?

I heard the presentations but not most of the discussion.  Returning to the issue of the three days, I note from the presentations that there is nearly full agreement that this should be fundamentally a community-based service, that the vast majority of abortions are likely to be medical, that the abortion pill will be administered in over 70% of cases and that therefore it makes sense for it to be community based.  However, if we take my community as an example, there is a very nice, modern health centre in Ballyfermot with several GP practices but it is very difficult to get an appointment.  It is a very busy area.  The last time I looked for an appointment, I was waiting for over a week to see a doctor even though I did not mind which doctor I saw.  That is kind of typical and therefore I think we have a genuine problem in terms of what GPs can provide.<\/p> <p>  On the whole business of the waiting time, I am very pleased to note all the witnesses agree that it removes power from the woman, is demeaning and can be an obstruction to receiving an abortion.  It is also a real problem to have that timing in there given the pressure on GP clinics I have just described.  Even the waiting time was counted from the day the woman picks up the phone, it could be still five or seven days before she gets the appointment.  I reiterate that it is a big part of it.<\/p> <p>  This is also linked with a question I have about the definition of \"medical practitioner\".  If anybody has already asked this, I apologise for repeating it.  The World Health Organisation safe abortion guidelines say that a medical practitioner is defined as a properly trained healthcare provider, including mid-level non-physician providers.  Would the witnesses see that there should be an important role here for midwives, practicing nurses and indeed counsellors in the health service to help provide the service?  If we are to go forward from January or whenever we can get this service in - sooner if possible - and if we are to rely totally on GPs when there is a crisis concerning the accessibility of GPs as it is, would it not make more sense for the Medical Council and everybody to recognise that nurses and midwives based in clinics could also provide the service, at least up to the point of providing the pill?<\/p> <p>  Taking in my second question on conscientious objection, along with the crisis in GP availability is the fact that some doctors may have a conscientious objection, which will add an extra burden onto the provision of the service.  There is a real, important role for us to be very clear in the legislation on the question of conscientious objection.<\/p><p>There must be an imperative on doctors to refer onwards if they are going to deny women the abortion service.  This must also be policed in order that we can see how conscientious objection is being applied and guarantee that the abortion service is provided.  I would like the witnesses to comment on these points.<\/p><p> There has been considerable discussion on the issue of decriminalisation.  Does the committee intend to examine it or would it be more appropriately sent on to the justice committee?  If a 14-year sentence has a chill factor for medical practitioners, then it is unnecessary and unduly heavy-handed and should be removed.  The issue should be examined in more detail by this or the justice committee.  Will the Chairman explain how that can be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#S01300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We covered the question of the waiting period.

I welcome our guests.  I have four, or maybe five, questions for them.<\/p> <p>  Form the discussions that have taken place between the professional groups, the Department of Health and the HSE, has agreement been reached, and is everyone in accord, on the concept of doing everything possible to meet the January deadline?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Favier correctly referred to the suite of ancillary or supportive services, including family planning and sex education in schools, which was not mentioned, that would provide information to men and women, boys and girls, in such a way as to improve their knowledge of the situation as life opens up before them, for example, how to deal with the kinds of situation that can arise in emergencies and their respective responsibilities in that regard.  How have these issues been examined in the professional exchanges since the referendum?<\/p> <p>  I do not agree with the now-emerging notion that a three-day waiting period is not necessary.  It was discussed at great length during the committee's hearings.  Reference has been made to other jurisdictions in which three-day or four-day waiting periods are applied.  A good number of European countries are counted.  In some cases, the Netherlands and Germany have longer waiting periods than is envisaged here.  Importantly, the committee discussed this matter at great length.  We agreed or disagreed, but we proceeded on that basis and the referendum followed.  According to the submission made by the medical professionals from the Netherlands, the women involved sometimes changed their minds, as was their right.  That right should be accommodated and I stand over that statement.  If there is a compelling reason for a woman or girl to seek a termination, she has a right to have counselling and some time.  That time should not be of such an extent to endanger her life or whatever the case may be, only to allow her to make a decision based on the best evidence available and what action is most appropriate for her in her particular circumstances.<\/p><p>That is why we come back to the GPs as the first point of counselling.  The GP must be in a position to advise a pregnant woman in such circumstances on what is best for her.  It is not within our remit to change what we have done because the people made the decision on the basis of the Citizens' Assembly hearings, the hearings in this committee room and the submissions made by various people in different, and in some cases appalling, circumstances.  It is important to try to remember that.  <\/p><p> Based on the discussions between professional groups and the HSE and the Minister, are the witnesses all of one opinion on the feasibility of putting together the package of services deemed to be required?<\/p><p> I accept the right to conscientious objections.  Based on the witnesses' discussions with their own professional groups and also with the HSE and the Department of Health, do they believe the services will have the ability to provide a universal service reasonably evenly across the country without areas that will require no services or sparse services?  Will the same constitutional benefits extend to all people throughout the country no matter where they live, without exception?<\/p><p> My last question is on the medical and surgical issue.  The most important thing is to address the health and safety issue, to make the service available and to make sure it is of the highest quality in order that nothing prevents a woman who may have a crisis pregnancy, whatever the case may be, from gaining access to the clinical advice and services required to address the issues she may have at any particular time.  For instance, I can see the three-day waiting period readily being accommodated within the system as it stands if there is a will to do so.  It is important that nothing shall impede the availability of the kind of service that a particular pregnant woman needs at a particular time.  I emphasise that because in the past there have been instances where in the aftermath people have said if something else had been done earlier, there might have been a different outcome.  We need to get away from that.  It is long since passed the time when women will allow a situation to prevail whereby anything less than the best and highest quality first response is available to them at all times.  That is what they spoke about and that is what the people who voted in the referendum spoke about and voted on.  We have to stick to it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#T01600","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I will answer some of those questions.  With regard to whether we are in agreement on the January timeline, we are in agreement that it is a tight timeline.  We are in agreement that lots of different measures need to be taken before then and a lot of integration needs to be done.  We do not say it is impossible but that it will be difficult.  That needs to be acknowledged and a great deal of work needs to be done between now and then to get a service up and running.  The only thing the IOG has been tasked with so far is the development of guidelines.  There is much more to do on the development of guidelines.  We can say what doses of medication are required at a different gestation point but there are many other pieces of the mix that need to be put in place and that requires talking to all stakeholders.  The committee is hearing that message today.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the three-day wait, it is ultimately a legislative issue.  Our point is not to put additional barriers in front of women and to acknowledge that internationally only 10% of women who are offered counselling go for it.  Most have done a lot of decision-making before making first contact.  We must be conscious of the time it could take if there is a three-day wait and an additional visit.  Ultimately, it is a legislative issue.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the feasibility issue, similar to the January timeline issue, we are not all of the same opinion.  There are conflicting opinions even among our members and among various GPs.  Within the ICGP, there is lots of discussion still being had.  We are not all of the same opinion on every issue.  There are some issues we are still considering and on which we need consultation with other medical practitioners, for example, regarding the administration of anti-D to rhesus negative women and whether it would be given at eight weeks or only over nine weeks.  Issues such as that on their own still require consultation.  If we add up all the issues in a complex roll-out, there is lots to be discussed in various fora.  We totally concur with the Deputy's remarks on accessibility and with other speakers that women have to be the focus of this and not necessarily the practitioners.  We must all be focused as multidisciplinary teams on dealing with the development of the best services for women.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan asked if we had reached agreement with all the stakeholders.

I do not think any of my questions have been dealt with at any stage during the hearings this morning.<\/p> <p>  Much was said about conscientious objection this morning.  I would be grateful for some assistance.  When we talk about what healthcare professionals may or may not be required to do, are we talking about criminal sanctions that might face people as a result of how they exercise their conscientious objection?  Are we talking about potential civil sanctions or litigation or are we talking about professional regulatory sanctions, employment consequences or protecting people from employment consequences?  I would be grateful if that issue could be teased out.  Are there examples of general practitioners, whether for conscience or capacity reasons - by conscience reasons, I mean anything such as religious or philosophical objection or their best judgment about authentic healthcare -  who do not offer particular elective medical services but do not have a duty to transfer?  I do not say that everything hinges on the answer to that question but I would like to know the answer to it.  This is an unique issue, a life and death issue.  This is an issue where there is a serious difference of opinion between healthcare professionals who regard abortion as a part of healthcare or alternatively as a human right versus a group of people who in good faith believe this is an unethical, harmful and possibly doubly harmful elective procedure.  Are there existing examples of cases where people do not have a duty to transfer, notwithstanding that they are not offering elective medical services?  Is there a difference in the view of the expert witnesses in the protection that should be afforded to nurses, midwives, other healthcare staff or professionals, including administrative staff, and people involved in teaching medical procedures compared with the protection afforded to doctors, who may have a conscientious objection?  Do they stand in the same relation?  Ought they stand in the same relation?  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the question of the three-day waiting period, to be frank I note the ICGP and IOG representatives are clearly dumping on the idea of a three-day waiting period, yet they are telling us that not all of the people they represent are of the same opinion on issues relating to this.  To what extent have the bodies consulted with members about the three-day waiting period?  What is the state of opinion among the ordinary membership of their respective bodies and can the witnesses enlighten us as to the statistics on how people think about this issue?  It is noticeable how sharply opposed to the three-day waiting period both bodies have been, yet they say at a different moment in the presentation that people have widely varying views.  When the witnesses say that it is not \"necessary\" - this is a word that was used - may I ask what they mean about it not being necessary?  Is there evidence that it facilitates some women in not choosing abortion in some cases?  I have heard it suggested it does not often happen but can the witnesses be more precise in their information?  Why is that condition provided in the Netherlands and in other places?  Are they saying that it is their view that the same number of abortions will take regardless of whether there is a three-day waiting period?<\/p> <p>  In saying that the IOG and ICGP representatives have a clear opposition to it, I have not heard, and perhaps I should have been listening more carefully, what the Medical Council has to say on that, if anything.  On the one hand, the Medical Council is saying that in its forthcoming guidelines, the doctor's view will be backgrounded and the patient's view will be to the foreground.  Mr. Prasifka, on the other hand, draws a distinction between what the law might permit and what the Medical Council considers to be ethical at the same time.  Is it conceivable that the Medical Council might take a view that there is an ethical dimension to the three-day waiting period?<\/p><p>Is it conceivable, for example, that even if the law does not effectively treat the unborn child as a patient where abortion is sought, the Medical Council might say that ethics require consideration of the unborn child as a patient be given?  Might that touch on decisions, reviews or recommendations of the council in respect of the three-day period?<\/p><p> Does a waiting period ever apply in the provision of other kinds of elective medical services?  Again, I am not saying the question of whether there ought to be one here hinges on the answer to that.  Is it the case that with most serious medical services, it simply does not happen on demand and on the day anyway?  The example was raised of a vasectomy.  I do not know how that works.  Is it rare for anything serious to happen on the spot or are there are examples of where waiting periods apply and are effectively prescribed, either by law or by regulation, such that people may not have immediate access to certain elective medical procedures?  Is it the view of our guests that the removal of a three-day waiting period could, or would, cause an influx of women from Northern Ireland seeking abortions in our jurisdiction?  Is it something any of the witnesses have discussed, or have there been submissions to that effect?<\/p><p> I will move to the third phase of my questions.  There has been much talk this morning about preventing crisis pregnancies but no talk about preventing abortion when crisis pregnancy arises.  I ask why that is the case.  I accept the Constitution no longer protects the lives of unborn children as a fundamental right, but it gives full power to the Oireachtas to regulate this area in whatever way we, as legislators, see fit, including, I presume, that we might choose to encourage women not to choose abortion as a matter of good public policy, public health, ethics and welfare of the unborn child and so on.  Why is there no talk of trying to prevent abortion in the context of a crisis pregnancy having arisen?  I presume a three-day waiting period is partly about that with respect to the welfare of the mother and the unborn baby.  I also presume it is one way of trying to keep the unborn child in focus as a patient deserving care, notwithstanding that abortion is permitted.  Is that the understanding of the witnesses as to why a three-day waiting period is in play?<\/p><p> Are there other examples of how the Legislature might keep the welfare of the unborn child in view in the context of an abortion regime applying?  Has any thought been given to how a woman requesting abortion might be engaged with?  I stress this should happen respectfully and never with deception or coercion?  For example, could there be a requirement for a woman to be offered an ultrasound and sight of the ultrasound to strike a balance?  Has that been discussed within the organisations represented here?<\/p><p> Dr. Peter Boylan has said the number of abortions here is likely to mirror that of Scotland due to our similar populations.  There were 12,100 abortions in Scotland last year.  Accepting it is difficult to quantify the number of abortions taking place while also accepting that the best information we have from British and international statistics indicates a much lower figure, do the witnesses accept we are looking at a significant increase in our current rate of abortion on the balance of probabilities?  In light of Dr. Boylan's expectation of 10% of cases resulting in admission, is it reasonable to speculate that we are talking about 1,200 additional hospital admissions in a year?  Given that we have an admissions crisis in hospitals with trolley numbers recently hitting an all-time high, is it reasonable to speculate how the system will cope with this?<\/p><p> It was mentioned that once abortion is introduced, rates fall over time.  I am open to correction but I understand that Scotland's rate has been increasing over the past three years, even as its birth rate has fallen steadily over the past ten years.  In a sense, that lends some kind of urgency to my question about the impact on the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#V02200","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>There are ten questions to be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#W00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I will take the conscientious objection issue.  The Medical Council was established very much to protect the interests of the public in its interaction with registered medical practitioners.  That is what I mean by the patient's voice coming first and the doctor's voice second.  The current provision as regards conscientious objection in the ethical guide covers all lawful treatments in this State and it is not specific to abortion provision.  It covers any treatment that a doctor holds ethical or moral concerns about and does not want to be involved with providing.  For example, this might include any services relating to reproduction such as vasectomy, which was raised earlier.  It also includes assisted reproduction and other lawful treatments.  It is not anticipated that this will change and it is important that it remains in the ethical guide to cover a multitude of treatments available in the country.  If there is an issue with how the conscientious objection is being delivered or interpreted by individual practitioners and that concern comes before the Medical Council, it will be managed in the usual way that any complaint is managed in front of the council.

The Senator mentioned the three-day waiting period but it is not fair to say we are advocating the dumping of the three-day period and we are sharply opposed to it.  We are saying that we do not have evidence to support it, which is quite separate.  Of course, the guideline we produce will be evidence-based and that is where we will go.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked what doctors want.  This is not about what doctors want but about what patients need.  It is important that it is framed in that way.  He asked if we consulted members, specifically those who hold opposing views and views of conscientious objection with regard to the provision of abortion services.  We have done so and an extensive process is under way currently.  It is a qualitative process and we have created an outline document for our members.  We have invited their contributions online and we are still in the process of doing that.  We are not at the end of the process and it will be the end of the week before it is finalised.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about waiting periods for other issues.  In general practice, I cannot think of another instance.<\/p> <p>  He asked about an influx of women from Northern Ireland and it is not unreasonable to expect, certainly in Border counties, that some women would avail of the services.  I do not know how Brexit will affect all of this or where any of that might go.<\/p><p> The Senator asked most specifically about the prevention of abortion when the woman presents.  That kind of goes back a little bit to Deputy Durkan's comment that the GP would advise what was the best thing for her.  I have never advised anyone what is the best thing for them.  I have entered into a dialogue with them as to what might be.  I might present them with evidence, one way or another, but I have wanted it to be something that they owned so that it was their decision-making more than my decision-making.  In terms of the prevention of abortion, it is more a question of allowing the woman to articulate what it is that has led her to the predicament that she is in and maybe explore with her what are her options in the face of that.  She may very well have made up her mind as to what those options are, and so be it, or it may be that in the process of the dialogue that there may be an alternative course of action that she then chooses to follow.  This goes back to the amount of time that will be available to GPs to have a discussion with patients.  Every woman will come with her own unique set of circumstances and context and her wishes and her needs will need to be front and centre of all of this.  The counselling services will have a bearing on that.<\/p><p> I am not sure, and the Senator raised the prospect of giving women sight of an ultrasound-----     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>To offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#X00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>If a woman wanted something then I would certainly try to facilitate what the woman wanted.

Anyone who pays attention to the committee proceedings knows which members only attend meetings of the committee at which women's healthcare is discussed.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the provision of services for women from the North was raised.  As the witnesses are aware, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, announced that such services will be available.  My question is a fairly simple one and relates to two areas.  The meetings which it is thought have been taking place were discussed.  It would be of concern if they have not been taking place.  At such meetings, have the witnesses discussed the provision of services to make good on that commitment given by the Minister for Health and also, possibly, the Taoiseach?  Has the provision of services for women from the North been discussed?  Brexit was mentioned.  Any discussion of the issue will have to be Brexit-proofed, although what form Brexit will take remains to be seen.<\/p> <p>  I have a concern regarding the collection of data.  Dr. Boylan and Dr. Murphy made reference to discussions that took place with their counterparts in Scotland.  I presume that when the witnesses went to Scotland their counterparts had access to information and could give the witnesses the profile of women accessing services there, which they can track over time.  Very little data will be collected under the current proposals.  What is the view of the witnesses on how we should go about the collection of data and whether we should try to gather more information?  Such data might inform considerations of the care and services that will be needed in the future and whether there may be a need for improved access to contraception or other services in certain areas.  The current proposals do not seem to prioritise the collection of such data.  I believe it important that they be collected.  I ask the witnesses for their views in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#Y01600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Audit is part of running any service.

The World Health Organization, WHO, has very good guidance on what type of data should be collected.  Patient and doctor confidentiality and the new GDPR recommendations must be considered.  For instance, every doctor's Medical Council number must currently be attached under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.

The fact of the matter is that the three-day waiting period is not a matter on which the Medical Council has any record.  It is not part of the current guide to professional conduct and ethics.  For us, it is really a matter for the Legislature.  Our primary goal, which is very important, is to come up with the ethical guide in light of the revised legislation, but we would tell the Oireachtas that the matter of the three-day waiting period at this point is firmly within its remit and is a matter of law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses: Dr.-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#Z00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Will the Chairman take one last question, which arises from the discussion, or would that upset him?

We are pleased to provide this opening statement in response to the committee&rsquo;s request to consider the matter of the authorisation of medicines for the termination of pregnancy, in light of the impending introduction of abortion services in Ireland.  The HPRA, as the competent authority for the authorisation of health products in Ireland, seeks to fully inform the committee in this regard by providing the following information.<\/p> <p>  We will briefly outline the medicines for medical termination of pregnancy and the system for the authorisation of medicines in Ireland and across the European network, in particular the mutual recognition procedure which is relevant to these medicines.  We will then provide an update on our work to date to secure authorised medicines, while respecting the applicants&rsquo; confidentiality.  We will conclude with a description of the exempt medicines scheme, which is relevant to facilitating the availability of a medicine where an authorised equivalent is not available.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, medical termination of pregnancy is achieved by the taking of two medicines, up to 48 hours apart, to induce a miscarriage.  The use of these medicines, in combination, results in a safer and more effective procedure.  In the European Union, both of these medicines are subject to prescription and can only be prescribed and administered in accordance with a country&rsquo;s national laws and regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#DD00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I have been called away unexpectedly.

It can also be used to soften and open the entrance or the cervix to the womb or uterus.  The second medicine, misoprostol, a prostaglandin, causes contraction of the womb and also softens the cervix.  Gemeprost, an alternative prostaglandin, may be used instead of misoprostol.<\/p> <p>  At present in Ireland, there are no medicines authorised for the termination of pregnancy.  Medicines for this medical indication are authorised in many European Union member states.  It should be noted that, across the EU, only a small number of companies are involved in the supply of these medicines.  <\/p> <p>  Apart from exceptional circumstances, to which I will refer later, under European and Irish law, medicines must be authorised before being marketed in a member state.  This is to ensure they meet the required standards, and patients have access to information on the safe and appropriate use of medicines.<\/p> <p>  A medicine is authorised by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, for sale and supply to the Irish market, following a detailed technical assessment of an application for a marketing authorisation.  This application is submitted by a company seeking to market a medicine in Ireland, in the form of a dossier which contains data to support the medicine&rsquo;s quality, safety and efficacy.  If, following assessment, the benefit-risk of the medicine is positive, a marketing authorisation is granted.  The company is then termed the marketing authorisation holder.<\/p> <p>  Medicines used in the termination of pregnancy are currently authorised in other European member states under a scheme of mutual recognition.  Under this scheme, a single EU member state is designated as the reference member state.  The reference member state is the EU-based competent authority which was responsible for assessment of the original application dossier and the ongoing co-ordination of dossier updates on behalf of other named EU countries, known as concerned member states.<\/p> <p>  EU law requires that where a medicine is authorised in another member state, a mutual recognition procedure must be used. Therefore, in order to market a medicine in Ireland for this indication, a marketing authorisation holder must apply to the reference member state to extend the authorisation to the Irish market and, simultaneously, submit an application dossier to the HPRA to<\/p> <p>allow the national phase of this process to occur.  This procedure is required to be completed within a maximum of 90 days of the HPRA&rsquo;s validation of the company&rsquo;s application dossier.  The HPRA will grant an authorisation, having confirmed the medicine&rsquo;s benefit-to-risk balance based on an abridged review, which acknowledges the authorisation granted by the reference member state.<\/p> <p>  Following the outcome of the referendum relating to the eighth amendment of the Constitution in May 2018, the HPRA sought to identify medicines actively marketed in other EU member states, which were indicated for use in the medical termination of pregnancy, and to inquire of the marketing authorisation holders as to their plans to apply for authorisation to market their medicines in Ireland.  This was with a view to, if possible, ensuring authorised medicines would be available at the time of coming into force of the legislation on medical termination of pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  While the HPRA cannot comment on specific applications for reasons of confidentiality, we can confirm that, to date, we have received applications and these are currently being assessed under 90-day mutual recognition procedures.  If the applications are considered acceptable, marketing authorisations can be issued in late 2018.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that these applications are running in a common procedure with a number of other EU concerned member states, so while we do not foresee significant issues, we would insert this note of caution with respect to the impact of other member states&rsquo; assessment on the timing of any final authorisation in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  If an authorisation is granted for a medicine for the termination of pregnancy, the HPRA has requested that the company would expedite the process for making supplies available in Ireland to facilitate the timely implementation of services.<\/p> <p>  In the event that medicines for the medical termination of pregnancy are not authorised by the end of 2018, there is an exemption in law for the treatment of patients with medical conditions for which an authorised medicine is not available.  This is known as the exempt medicines scheme.  Specifically, an unauthorised medicine is considered exempt from authorisation when it is supplied<\/p> <p>under prescription from a registered doctor for treatment of individual patients in order to fulfil an unmet medical need.<\/p> <p>  The HPRA does not issue approvals for use of exempt medicines.  Wholesalers and manufacturers based in Ireland are required to notify the HPRA when they have sourced exempt medicines for the purposes of supply in Ireland.  The wholesaler or manufacturer is required to have processes in place to capture and record any adverse reaction notified in respect of an exempt medicine and to report this to the HPRA.<\/p> <p>  Over the coming weeks, the HPRA will assess the applications received to date and maintain contact with prospective marketing authorisation holders regarding the supply of their medicines in Ireland.  The HPRA anticipates receipt of further applications in early 2019, and these will also be made through the mutual recognition procedure.<\/p> <p>  The HPRA is aware of the importance of ensuring supply of medicines for the medical termination of pregnancy.  We will continue to work with the Department of Health, relevant stakeholders and companies to put in place the services mandated by the forthcoming legislation.  We will be happy to address any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#DD00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Breslin.

It is our practice to work closely with the Department on the supply of medicines and in preparing for the supply of new medicines.<\/p> <p>  On the Vice Chairman's second question, one of the aspects we review routinely is the safety of medicines prior to their being placed on the Irish market.  As she correctly said, the medicines used in the termination of pregnancy in other EU countries are long authorised and their safety is well established.  It is known, for example, that the common side effects associated with these medicines are symptoms such as cramping, pain, bleeding, nausea and vomiting.  Women can be allergic to these medicines and certain contraindications need to be taken account of.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the process I have described around the authorisation of medicines, the company submits a dossier to us but we then receive an independent report from the reference member state that has authorised this medicine and that has experience of the safe and effective use of that medicine.  We receive that independent assessment, which is part of our review along with the dossier from the company.  We can give comments back on that and the company has an opportunity to respond.

I shall address the clinical issues.  The usual schedule is that the Mifepristone is taken first.  This would be early termination of pregnancy.  Depending on the dose, it is one tablet.  It is usual that Misoprostol is taken second, which is advised by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, within 48 hours.  The Deputy is probably aware that there are different regimens.  Those two products are attractive or useful in the community setting because they are indicative for oral use.  Gemeprost is for vaginal use and is perhaps a less useful product.  If the intention of the system is for this to operate within the community and for women to take the first medicine under the supervision of the medical practitioner and the second medicine at home, it would be more practical that it be an oral medicine.  That is usually the system.  We are aware that Gemeprost is used but according to the information we have to date, it is mainly for hospital-based use, and it may be used for the more complex types of terminations, as were discussed at the earlier session.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there was more than one player in the market.  Three companies supply these medicines throughout the EU and we actively engaging with them.  As I clarified earlier, we must initiate a mutual recognition procedure or be involved in that kind of procedure.  We have engaged with each of these companies requesting them to make applications.  We have also engaged with member states that have authorised those medicines asking them to act as the reference member state.  We are approaching this from two aspects with a view to maximising the opportunity of getting applications here.<\/p> <p>  The pricing is outside the remit of the HPRA.  We have nothing to do with that.  As I said earlier, we have had close contact with primary care reimbursement service and with the Department, and we have mentioned to them the fact that there are three companies marketing these.  There are a limited number of options available but these companies are marketing throughout the EU.<\/p> <p>  On the conditions of use, the product information requires that pregnancy is diagnosed using biological methods such as a urine or blood test to measure HCG or an ultrasound.  The conditions of use do not mandate how a pregnancy is diagnosed, just that pregnancy must be diagnosed prior to the administration of the first medicine.  There are exclusion criteria.  For example, if there was concern about an ectopic pregnancy when the woman presents with pain or bleeding or with a past medical history, it would be taken into account.  If a women has an inter-uterine device, which is a contraceptive device, this is also a contraindication to the use of these medicines.  All of this is part of the routine review.  The rhesus factor is also assessed.  The product information will contain the basic information about the indications, the contraindications to use, the side effects of the treatment and how to use the medicine safely.<\/p><p>Since the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, these medicines for the termination of pregnancy have been imported through the exempt scheme for supply to hospitals only.  Under the Act, they are permitted for medical terminations of pregnancy in certain circumstances but it has to be a hospital-based treatment.  There is an established exempt supply scheme for the companies that manufacture these medicines and that will be helpful moving forward.<\/p><p> Liability is not a matter for us.  We permit the exempt scheme and I will ask my colleague, Mr. Lynch, to give more details on that, but essentially the law states that there must be a medical prescription by a medical practitioner who is registered in Ireland and it must be for a patient under his or her care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#EE00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>It is correct that within the European medicines directive, which has been transposed, that the use of exempt or unauthorised products must be to meet the special needs of patients under the direct responsibility of a medical practitioner.

No. 1 on the agenda is the chairperson designate of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  Today's meeting will involve two sessions.  The purpose of our first session is to engage with the chairperson designate of NOAC, Mr. Michael McCarthy, who is no stranger to this room, and discuss his strategic priorities for his role and his views on the challenges currently facing NOAC.  The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet with the chairperson designate in public session to hear his views and we trust that this serves to provide greater transparency to the process of appointments to our State boards and bodies.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. McCarthy back in a different role - I know he sat in this chair a number of times prior to me.  I welcome him back to the committee and I look forward to his opening statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#A00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537345800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair, the committee members and the secretariat for the opportunity to address the committee this morning.  I reiterate my thanks to the committee for the invitation.  It is an honour for me to be present as the Minister's nominee for the chair of the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  I welcome this important first engagement and I am very much looking forward to working with all stakeholders in this new role.  I hope to continue the good work that has already been completed to date and to build on this work so that real reform is evident and that any challenges in perception and reality are addressed.  I am aware that real reform takes time and that only through working together will we continue to make the necessary progress over the coming years.  I come to NOAC with great interest and an understanding of local government and with a genuine belief that I can make a useful contribution to the work of NOAC.  I am coming into this role without baggage or any conflict of interest.  This will allow me to engage credibly with all stakeholders and hopefully bring some fresh thinking and new ideas to further enhance the role of NOAC.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by outlining what NOAC is about and how it operates.  NOAC was established in July 2014 as an independent statutory body to provide oversight of the local government sector in Ireland.  It is a key element of the local government reform agenda that emerged from the proposals set out in the action programme for effective local government.  It is underpinned by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  NOAC&rsquo;s functions are wide-ranging, involving the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically.  NOAC also supports best practice, oversees the implementation of national local government policy, monitors and evaluates implementation of corporate plans, adherence to service level agreements and public service reform by local government bodies.  A Government Minister may also request that NOAC be asked to prepare a report, relevant to its functions, on any specified aspect of local government.<\/p> <p>  NOAC has published 18 reports to date.  Its reports and recommendations are presented to key decision makers in the local and national government sector including the relevant Joint Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  NOAC publishes annual local authority performance indicators and composite public spending code quality assurance reports.  Those published to date cover the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The 2017 reports will be published early in quarter four of 2018.  The annual performance indicator report published by NOAC is one of its key reports every year.  NOAC has the function of scrutinising local authority performance against relevant indicators.  The performance indicator sub-group&rsquo;s mandate is to recommend appropriate performance indicators for local authority activity and to oversee the data collection, verification, compilation and publication of a report on those indicators annually.  NOAC believes that monitoring performance over time and against comparable authorities has the potential to encourage continuous improvement in local authority service provision.  A list of all NOAC&rsquo;s published reports is available on the NOAC website.<\/p> <p>  NOAC operates a sub-group structure covering the areas of performance indicator reporting, customer surveys, financial performance, housing studies, local enterprise offices, LEOs, reporting under the public spending code, PSC, and the oversight of efficiency reform implementation.  Each sub-group consists of three to four members, who take responsibility for progressing various projects, with regular reporting to the full NOAC when key decisions are required.  The nature of NOAC&rsquo;s statutory functions means that there will be an on-going requirement for some sub-groups, while others may only exist for the duration of a particular project.  NOAC&rsquo;s membership is statutorily prescribed as a minimum of six and a maximum of nine members.  There is provision for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to increase, by order, the number of members to a maximum of 12 for a period of up to two years.  SI 536 made by the Minister on 19 October 2016 increased the number of members to 11.<\/p><p>NOAC does not have a separate executive and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government provides its secretariat.  Earlier this year, a new section was established with a staff complement of five to provide the secretariat functions for both NOAC and the new water advisory body.<\/p><p> As I have mentioned, NOAC&rsquo;s role in local government policy is to oversee how the national policy is implemented by local government bodies.  NOAC does not have a function of providing input into the development of policy for the sector.  When it comes to financial performance, NOAC&rsquo;s role is to scrutinise the performance of any local government body in respect of the financial resources available to it, including value for money.  To fulfil this function, NOAC carried out a review of local authority rates collection performance because this is a significant revenue source for the sector.  It also reviews the reports by the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, of its annual audits of local authority financial statements and follows up on selected aspects raised in those reports.  NOAC also reviews value for money reports produced by the value for money unit of the LGAS.  Regular meetings are held between NOAC and the director of the LGAS, and NOAC has established a good working relationship with the director there and her team.<\/p><p> In 2017, NOAC started compiling profiles of each local authority based primarily on the material in our reports and meetings with the chief executives.  The profile also included information provided by the authorities themselves outlining the particular context within which they each operate.  The chief executive and management team attend a NOAC meeting to answer questions from the NOAC members on topics such as finances, customer service, corporate planning, housing issues, performance indicators, tourism initiatives, employment within the county, and economic and community development.  To date, three meetings have taken place with Louth and Offaly county councils and Cork City Council.  It is planned to progress and expand on this work in the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 using the recent validation visits for the performance indicators report as a first step in this process.<\/p><p> Customer service is an important area and NOAC is engaged in a three-year programme of carrying out a customer survey for similarly sized local authorities.  The report for the largest ten local authorities was published this summer.  Work will continue in 2018 on a local authority customer satisfaction survey for the next ten largest local authorities.  Other areas being worked on are reviews of aspects of financial performance and the internal audit function, as well as the annual performance indicators and public spending code quality assurance reports.<\/p><p> I am aware that NOAC receives substantial support and assistance from the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, particularly in the collection and compilation of data for the performance indicators report.  The LGMA&rsquo;s assistance in organising NOAC events such as the very successful good practice in local authorities seminar and the customer service workshops was also invaluable.  NOAC will periodically hold such events to disseminate clever and innovative practices or examples of efficiencies in the performance of local authorities that it encounters in its work.  It is important that this relationship continues to grow and develop so that real alignment with the local government sector is evident.<\/p><p> At all times I will be conscious of the role of NOAC and will be striving to see NOAC recognised as an organisation that can deliver real reform.  Central to this will be making sure that local authorities are delivering real value for money while adhering to proper governance.  NOAC will also ensure that it supports the best practices that are central to the work of local authorities.  Successful transformation requires robust planning, clear and coherent leadership and suitably skilled staff.  The impact of increasing demands across local government, the changing landscape in which councils operate, and the impact of the significant uncertainty as well as increasing complexity brought about by Brexit mean that planning and oversight have never been more important.  Robust plans that project how local authorities&rsquo; outcomes and priorities will be delivered and funded are essential to ensuring the sustainability of services to the public.  It is important that NOAC be there to ensure that these decisions are taken in a planned and co-ordinated way and that the impact of decisions on communities and outcomes is transparent and understood.<\/p><p> I very much look forward to working with the NOAC members, chief executives, liaison officials and performance indicator co-ordinators of the 31 local authorities and with the other bodies, agencies and Departments that supported NOAC in its work.  I express my gratitude to the outgoing chairman, Pat McLoughlin, for the time he has taken to update me on the role and for the valuable and extensive work that he has carried out during his time as chairman of NOAC.  He and his board members have done some valuable work, and I look forward to continuing the very important work they have started.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537345800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>A number of people are indicating to ask questions but I made an oversight in that I forgot to read the note on privilege.<\/p><p>I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

I want to be clear that this is not an interview process and I thank him for coming in and sharing with us his hopes, aspirations and plans for NOAC.<\/p> <p>  I take the view that before every meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing Planning and Local Government I notify councillors around the country of all groups and none on what is going on and the agenda.  I told them yesterday that Mr. McCarthy would be coming here and I did some research on NOAC.  It was interesting to me that within 20 minutes I had seven emails.  I will not talk about the councillors' questions but they came back immediately from Fingal, Kildare, Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown twice, Kildare again and then Waterford.  The gist of those emails was that some of them did not fully understand what NOAC is about and what its functions are.  A common and recurring theme was that it has no teeth, it is a public relations, PR, exercise, and that it is commissioning reports with only 100 people surveyed so it cannot be accurate.  Those are just some of the criticisms.  Someone correctly suggested that NOAC picked ten of the largest sitting local authorities out of the 31 local authorities, and Mr. McCarthy would know about all of that.<\/p> <p>  One of the challenges for NOAC is to explain its role more.  It has completed 18 reports so far and some of them are very well done, but what is happening behind that?  NOAC carried out a major survey on the subsidiary companies of local authorities and we have a plethora of subsidiary companies across the 31 local authorities, of which serious questions must be asked about their corporate governance and, more importantly, about their impact on local authorities, where the authorities are finding themselves having to give letters and guarantees in terms of funding to prop up some of these companies.  I would go as far as to say that some of these companies are not viable if not totally insolvent.  They are only trading on the basis of letters of guarantee and backup.  They vary from property companies to other companies involved in sports, leisure and recreation, but I am more concerned about the property companies.  I have had a look at the accounts of some of these property companies and there are serious questions about them.<\/p> <p>  My concern is, and NOAC's concern should be, the impact this will have on the taxpayer and the local authorities and the deficit in corporate governance from the elected members.  If there are council nominees, their duty of care would be to the corporate affairs of the company, but if they are elected members as well then there is a conflict.  Mr. McCarthy's predecessor identified these issues in a recent report and I appeal to Mr. McCarthy to look at the reports that NOAC has done, without looking to do more reports, and examine how NOAC can act on the impact of those reports after six or eight months.  There are serious concerns and NOAC has done good work.  It may require further legislation and that is a matter for Mr. McCarthy, his board and colleagues and his contacts with the Department and the Minister.  I suggest that he looks at a closer synergy and a greater relationship with the Local Government Audit Service.<\/p> <p>  Another deficit coming from these emails that I wish to raise, even though I acknowledge and appreciate that it is not Mr. McCarthy's direct responsibility, is the audit committees and their relationship with the greater local authorities.<\/p><p>If Mr. McCarthy is sending a report on the NOAC, he should write to the cathaoirleach of each local authority to ask to have it put on the agenda because sometimes it is all about communication.  The NOAC is doing good work and if information is being sent to a city or county manager - the chief executive as he or she is now called - I am not convinced that it is filtering down.  For instance, a number of members of local authorities contacted me to say they had not seen the NOAC's audit report.  The challenge must be to have greater engagement with elected members to explain the NOAC's role and functions.  That might mean a road show for Mr. McCarthy throughout the country to explain them to them and encourage them as major stakeholders in ensuring good local governance.  It is a two-way street.  It involves not just the executive but also the elected members.  If anything, there is a deficit in that regard.<\/p><p> I wish Mr. McCarthy well.  I am aware of his experience.  I took some time yesterday to look him up.  I am aware that he is committed to assisting local authorities.  I am confident that he has the necessary skills and hunger to succeed.  He might take on board some of the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#B00300","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537345800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. McCarthy and congratulate him on his appointment.

The NOAC does an incredible amount of good work.  As Mr. McCarthy stated, 18 reports have been completed.  I often wonder how many of the actions or recommendations made within those reports have been implemented by local authorities.<\/p> <p>  From my point of view, having served on the audit committee when it was first established, I found it to be a fantastic body in moving the local authority in the right direction.  Equally, it gave guidance to the chief executive, but, again, many of the recommendations of the audit committee were not implemented.<\/p> <p>  I have looked at some of the reports.  The report on commercial rates was one on which I would have always focused at local authority level.  Has each local authority been sent copies of the reports or are NOAC reports sent directly to the relevant SPCs?  The amount of information contained in the reports is incredible and can help.<\/p> <p>  I always find trying to make comparisons between local authorities almost impossible because they all have different interpretations of matters and different ways of presenting information, including on performance indicators.  I would have been involved in planning and seen that one local authority presented information in a different way from another.  It is time to standardise how information is presented across the 31 local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Going back to commercial rates, having served for 12 years on a local authority, it was eight years before I realised housing rent payments were written off in the budget process and that one could see the figure.  I could not understand how collection rates were high in the case of social housing rent payments, yet in the case of commercial rates we were not doing what we should have been.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I had at local authority level was no one ever went out to collect money.  Local authorities did not take a proactive approach, even though they the power to do so.  They had a lean on commercial property which could not be sold until commercial rates were paid.  Rates that were owed by an individual which could be dealt with in a year or two were manageable, but in year eight or nine they became unmanageable and the business closed.  That had a knock-on effect.  The local authority was not proactive in collecting the rates due.<\/p> <p>  I wish Mr. McCarthy well in his position.  The NOAC does an incredible amount of work, but how much do the members of the local authorities know about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#C00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537345800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank members for their courteous comments and constructive engagement.  I will give an holistic response and try to touch on as many of the topics raised as possible.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Victor Boyhan, I have examined the position.  I am no different from the Senator, Deputy Pat Casey and Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  My previous life did not differ from that of the vast majority of practitioners of the political arts.  It would have been born primarily out of a local government base.  At that rudimentary democratic level one become involved in the business of the local authority and aware of how it does its business.  There are a number of issues that stand out from that experience, one of which is the manner in which different local authorities do their business differently from others and successive administrations have tried to co-ordinate their activities or put them on a level platform.  It is splintered in that way.  There are now 31 local authorities, some of which are good at doing some things, while others may be not as good in some respects.  <\/p> <p>  There is a big challenge for me, as chairperson, to raise the profile of the NOAC and sell its message.  It does a lot of good work.  I, too, share the view that once someone has a good story to tell, it is difficult to tell it.  If someone was doing something wrong, everybody would be aware of it and it would dominate the news cycle.  That is how it is nowadays.  I see its work as important in the context of stakeholder engagement.  I refer to the Local Government Audit Service, the County and City Management Association and the elected members of local authorities.  I have great respect for the system of public administration, but I have always deferred to the manner in which local authority members go about their work.  They are the eyes and ears of communities throughout the country in every parish and one cannot but be affected in some positive way by the roles played by local authorities, be it in the provision of housing, roads, libraries and playgrounds.  It is a meaningful part of the democratic system.  In my chairmanship of the NOAC I am anxious to co-ordinate the activities of the different stakeholders and focus on areas where we think there are improvements to be made, bearing in mind the remit is one of oversight.<\/p> <p>  To answer Senator Grace O'Sullivan's question, particularly about housing, I reiterate this line because it is important that I do not create the impression that I can comment on it directly or can directly influence policy because I am expressly forbidden from doing so.  The NOAC does not have a function or an input in the development of policy for the sector.  Our role strictly is to oversee how national policy is being implemented at local government level.<\/p> <p>  To chime with Deputy Pat Casey's point, I see the valuable work audit committees are doing across local authorities.  There is an obvious connection between the overarching role of the NOAC and the individual work being completed by audit committees in local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Being in mind that I have not been officially appointed, I have only had a tertiery role in monitoring the functions of the NOAC.  I am aware, however, that all of the reports have been sent to key decision makers in local authorities.  I want to ensure all elected members have access to them.  The reports are put up on the website.  I am anxious to ensure all of the reports and the stories surrounding them will be directly communicated to local authorities members because they include important information that has been gleaned from the Local Government Audit Service, also on behalf of the NOAC.<\/p><p>That can be useful and beneficial to local authority members when it comes to budgetary planning issues, audit services and so on.<\/p><p> Primarily, I see the role as being very important in raising the profile of NOAC, but also in engaging critically with the stakeholders, beginning with the local authority members and their organisational and representative associations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537345800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I fully agree that councils are the eyes and ears of every community.  What can be done is to shine a light on a dark place by upping one's game as to how one launches one's reports and how one engages with the media on those reports.  Councillors and local authorities are particularly sensitive to criticism.  That can be used in a positive way, or it can be a negative if one sees it as a negative.  I see it as a positive.  One has guidelines and national indicators and where people are not performing, they should be flushed out and exposed.  I see that as a role for the commission.  It is about imaginatively using one's role.  One can push out the parameters of one's role but can also stay within the remit set down for the commission by the Minister and the Department.<\/p> <p>  In relation to Mr. McCarthy's comment on the audit committees, I believe that they are not working as well as he might think.  Mr. McCarthy will learn this in time.  It is sometimes the dynamic of a local authority that is evident.  There are certain predictables on the audit committees.  By their very nature they are a closed shop.  That is not necessarily a good thing, which is another issue one might look at.  When one has reports, good, bad or indifferent, the commission should use its office and resources.  That is the challenge I am putting to the commission, to use its resources, its office and its staff to go to the public and inform them.  The media will not be slow to pick up on this.  That is perhaps the best lever to effect change.

One of the reasons, about which the Cathaoirleach will be glad to hear, is that there was a dog on the M1.  I do not know if it was a Fianna F&aacute;il dog or not.  It caused a bit of disruption but went quietly in the end.  It held us all up for about 20 minutes.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. McCarthy to the committee.  I know he has been the chairperson of committees and is very knowledgeable.  I wish to make a number of small points.  The accountability of local government and audits is hugely important.  When was the last independent analysis of local government financing done?  This relates to how councils present their accounts and data.  I often felt councillors were very knowledgeable but they are given reports in a set format by the local authority.  When I was a member - we cannot be, and have not been, members for a number of years - one of the things I was aware of was that the headings and subheadings could not be changed.  One could find a couple of million euro in a miscellaneous account and one did not know what it was for.  An independent analysis of the structures to look behind these miscellaneous items and to look at what I always believed was hidden expenditure that was not accountable and that one could not get at might change the perception.<\/p> <p>  The other point relates to the annual budget.  Councillors have always had a statutory role in passing the local authority finance provisions but they never had the time or expertise to go through the budget properly, that is, line by line, item by item.  If councillors had access to an independent view or analysis of what was there and of what they were being told, that there might be a better outcome.  I am not accusing local authority officials of hiding things; I am not.  The more transparency there is, the better.  In County Louth, there is a great deficit in the local authority.  Parking spaces for commuters are being cut as are high profile items of great importance which everybody wants.  We must try to see behind this and get accountability.  I am not sure if that is the role of the commission.

I thank the Chair and committee members for the opportunity to give evidence.<br\/><br\/>I have been appointed recently by the Minister as chair of the Water Advisory Body.  I am currently a commissioner and chairperson of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  I am joined by the other two members of the Water Advisory Body, also recently appointed by the Minister.  They are Mr. Darragh Page, programme manager with the office of environmental enforcement at the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and Ms Sharon Kennedy, senior executive officer with An F&oacute;ram Uisce.  We have been appointed to the Water Advisory Body for a five-year term with an end date of May 2023.  The remaining two members of the advisory body will be appointed through the Public Appointments Service.  The advertisement for the two positions was published on 22 August 2018 on <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>.  The closing date for submission of expressions of interest is today, 19 September 2018.  I am hopeful that these appointments will be made in October of this year.  We look forward to the appointment of the remaining two members in order that the Water Advisory Body can consider and submit its first report to the Oireachtas committee.<br\/><br\/>We are conscious that the Water Advisory Body has been established to provide a level of assurance to the Oireachtas and members of the public on the transparency, accountability and performance of Irish Water.  Specifically, the advisory body has a legal function to advise the Minister on measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water and to provide an annual report to the Minister on the performance of the Water Advisory Body&rsquo;s functions during the period since its establishment.<br\/><br\/>The Water Advisory Body will also furnish a quarterly report to the joint committee on the performance of Irish Water in the implementation of its business plan with particular regard to the following areas: infrastructure delivery and leakage reductions; cost reduction and efficiency improvements; improvements in water quality, including the elimination of &quot;boil water&quot; notices; procurement, remuneration and staffing policies; and responsiveness to the needs of communities and enterprise.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline progress to date.  The Water Advisory Body has met on two occasions, 13 July and 31 August 2018.  Early discussions have focused on several matters, including governance, rules of procedure and terms of reference for the advisory body, as well as the establishment of a website and identity to facilitate the transparency of our work.  We have also commenced discussion on the content and format of quarterly reports to the joint committee.  With specific reference to our reports, we have considered the sources of information which will feed into these reports and the frequency with which that information is available.<br\/><br\/>We are keen to ensure that the reports we prepare provide meaningful information about Irish Water&rsquo;s performance in the key areas identified in the legislation.  Our aim is to focus on what is important and explain why that is the case.  We aim to identify and draw together a set of key performance metrics from various sources.  These will include various CRU and EPA reports and data and information from other sources, including An F&oacute;ram Uisce and Irish Water.  Our aim is for this set of metrics to help to demonstrate how Irish Water is performing against these headings over time.<br\/><br\/>Over the next few months, we will continue to develop our report structures and content sources, identify these metrics and determine how often they are updated.  We will also explore how we might use each quarterly report to explore particular aspects of Irish Water&rsquo;s performance in more detail.  As soon as the remaining two members of the advisory body are appointed, the members will finalise the reporting structure and content and prepare the first formal report for submission to the joint committee.  We look forward to meeting the committee regularly in the future to discuss our findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537345800,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McGowan for his presentation.  I wish the advisory body the best of luck.  I was not a supporter of the establishment of Irish Water five years ago, but we are where we are.  My objection concerned local democracy, not the national issue.  The establishment of Irish Water removed from local representatives the power to decide how their county grew.  I still hold that point of view.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise some very frustrating issues regarding Irish Water.  The first concerns the interaction between Irish Water and local authorities in respect of the planning process and how planning permissions are granted.  An issue arise regarding whether such permissions are granted with Irish Water having agreed on connections and whether a service is provided.  Local authorities are not accepting communications from Irish Water to developers indicating that a development may proceed.  Clarity needs to be brought to the entire interaction surrounding the planning process.  Once planning permission is granted, it should be possible for work to commence.  In many cases, the developer must first enter negotiations with Irish Water on the provision of water and sewerage services or with other utilities on the provision of other services.  This is hampering the process.  Work needs to be done on streamlining interactions between Irish Water and local authorities in granting planning permission.  I could provide examples of cases where this process is not working.  <\/p> <p>  I have had many communications with Irish Water, often very positive.  However, one area on which I receive few replies is infrastructure.  I have raised this matter a number of times and I will not let it go.  Irish Water is doing a good job on critical infrastructure and larger projects but does not look beyond that, unless a wastewater treatment plant causes problems.  In rural areas and in towns with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants, Irish Water is not at the races.  It does not even consider these places unless they are polluting and causing problems.<\/p><p>We need to address the issue as to whether Irish Water has to set aside a team or a specific budget.   These communities cannot be forgotten about but they are.  The economic model does not stack up for small villages.  The horizon which Irish Water set in its first report required payback within 15 and 20 years.  There is no way a small town or a village will have a payback like that.  Is there any report from Irish Water stating it will deal with small villages?  In County Wicklow, villages such as Donard, Laragh, Glendalough and Avoca have no water infrastructure.  As a result, they cannot expand or planning permission cannot be granted for houses.  There is nothing coming forward on the infrastructure being upgraded in these areas.  Irish Water needs to dedicate a budget or a team to that aspect of rural Ireland.<\/p><p> On the issue of charges, Irish Water has been established for five years but there is still not a national commercial rate charge.  There are still 31 different charges across the country.  Connection fees, whether to just connect into a sewer or the provision of a sewerage facility, are not done.  At this stage, I have lost track of how a developer calculates how much the infrastructure will cost in a project.<\/p><p> Irish Water is working well in certain regards and I will not take away from that.  While it is tackling key issues, many others need to be addressed.  Elements in Irish Water are adding to the housing crisis because we are not getting clear communications on the granting of planning permissions in respect of who is responsible, who is making a final decision and who has the authority to allow it go ahead<\/p><p> I wish Dr. McGowan the best of luck.  I am sure he will be before the committee in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#E00400","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537345800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. McGowan and wish him well in his appointment which the Minister has made.  This is not an interview process but I thank him for the courtesy of attending the committee and sharing some of his ideas as new chairperson of the Water Advisory Body.<\/p> <p>  The main issues for Irish Water, and the main challenges Dr. McGowan will have, relate to accountability, transparency and its performance.  These problems have fed into many of the controversies relating to Irish Water.  It was always going to be difficult when transferring a utility service from 31 local authorities in a disjointed way.  There were HR, personnel and resources issues, as well as issues of responsibility and who would lead out from that.  There are still difficulties and it is working its way through.<\/p> <p>  There are boil water notices and substantial leaks in the service.  The citizen is rightly demanding a high-quality and consistent water supply.  Infrastructure has to be both national and local.  We cannot forget the small community.  The challenge is how one is going to be responsive to the needs of the customers from big industry and enterprise, as well as small communities.<\/p> <p>  I wish Dr. McGowan well but he needs to go back to the same issue, namely what citizens are demanding of Irish Water and any service provider for that matter, which is accountability, transparency and performance.  Those issues need to be kept to the fore in the delivery of public services and this is no exception.  I wish Dr. McGowan the best of luck with his job and, hopefully, he will engage regularly with the committee.

He has one of the most important tasks because water is such an important resource for so many services and users.

People still remember it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to his ambition and vision for his new task, what will be his key priorities?  How does he believe he can improve communications between the advisory body, members of the public and local authorities?

The interaction my constituents and I have had with Irish Water is top-class.  Irish Water goes the extra mile to help the individual.  That is important in the work it is doing.  We have many complaints and issues about water services but they are dealt with efficiently.  When one picks up the phone, the staff are courteous and efficient.  They will get back to one within an hour or two with the reference number.  They are attentive to the individual's needs.  On one occasion, a developer had a problem and could not get a supply because of some bureaucratic nonsense going on with the county council.  It was sorted out quickly at a high level in Irish Water.<\/p> <p>  There was an occasion at the Donore reservoir when the water supply system collapsed.  There was inadequate emergency planning, which meant the water supply for the town of Drogheda and east County Meath suffered greatly for several days.  As a result of the excoriation Irish Water received at the time, which it properly deserved, it changed its ways.  When it happened again, the company was much better prepared.  When the pipes failed at 4 p.m., they had workers on site at 6 p.m. who worked throughout the night.  Irish Water is learning its lessons.<\/p> <p>  Due to incidents and accidents such as this, as well as climate change and acts of God, I am concerned about water supply in the greater Dublin area.  What role does the advisory body have in that?  Part of the solution to preventing water supply to the greater Dublin area being interrupted and not adequately resolved for a significant time, is getting water from the Shannon.  While I am not sure what involvement the Water Advisory Body will have in that, it is important the process be explained properly to the people in the areas from where the water will be extracted.   There should be a complete immersion in all of the issues that affected residents might have by Irish Water.  It is important, however, that the water needs of the greater Dublin area will be met.<\/p> <p>  I have had many problems and issues with Irish Water in the past.<\/p><p>There is an outstanding issue that involves transparency, notwithstanding everything I have said.  We can get access online to the meetings of its board but it has refused under FOI to give me copies of the minutes of its management meetings, that is, when it meets at a level just below board level.  I could appeal it to the Information Commissioner if I wish.  In the interests of transparency, it might be useful if I could send the witnesses a copy of the correspondence.  We should be able to see everything Irish Water does and no part of its activity should be excluded from public scrutiny and transparency.  I do not know what is going on.  The area I was trying to get at involved some of the issues in my own area.  I do not have an answer to that but the role of the Water Advisory Body might be effective in ensuring all meetings are transparent.  If there are commercial issues, that is fine.  We do not need to see them but we do need to see what Irish Water is saying and doing and how it is planning.  That will provide the public with increased confidence as the entity continues into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#F00400","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537345800,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being present earlier but I had to attend another event.  I thank the witnesses for the brief presentation.  The quarterly reports mentioned by them will be important for the committee's work.  I wish to flag a few issues so that when the first of those reports comes in, they might be addressed.  One of the big issues, particularly in the context of water shortages caused by weather difficulties recently, is leakage reduction.  There has been significant public attention, particularly among the media and others, on leakage reduction and domestic wastewater reduction, which is legitimate and to which I have no objection.  One issue we have raised with the Department and Irish Water is the need to address the greater level of leakage in the system, which is on the public distribution system, and in particular, whether the relatively modest targets for tacking leakage within the infrastructure are the most appropriate.  Irish Water's capital investment starts to increase significantly over the next number of years.  A figure of &euro;777 million is in the programme for next year, &euro;800 million for the following year and &euro;900-odd million after that.  When we compare the programme of leakage reduction with what happened recently in London, which is an old city with many of the comparable challenges of infrastructural upgrading, it seems Irish Water's targets are modest.  When we put that to the company representatives, they told us that closing down the city centre is a challenge, but not all the leaks are within the city centre.  There are large urban areas inside and outside the canals where work could be done.  It is important that the witnesses give us a sense of what progress has been made on this and, by way of international comparisons with comparable cities, whether more work could be done.<\/p> <p>  In respect of cost reduction and efficiency improvements, which, again, are important issues, one of the concerns is that there is a change in the way in which Irish Water is accounting for capital and current expenditure because it is now working within the OECD's defined set of rules.  One of the consequences is the fact that certain items that would have previously come under current expenditure such as the relatively small to medium-sized cost for repair of water treatments plants will be classed as capital expenditure because they are subcontracted to private contractors.  If we are being presented with current expenditure reductions, it is important that they are genuine reductions and not something that has been transferred to the capital expenditure side for whatever reason.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding procurement, remuneration and staffing policies, when Deputies talk to water engineers in local authorities, there is a value in having that local knowledge within local authorities.  These water engineers know the community and the area and have a level of intelligence or institutional memory that is built up over a long period of time.  One of the difficulties is that is lost by using subcontractors for regional-based bodies of work in which Irish Water is engaged.  People who do not necessarily know the county or region could be in Cork one week, Donegal next week and Dublin the week after that.  That is not to say they are not as skilled but they do not have that local knowledge.  In respect of staffing policies and efficiency, is there a gain in terms of shifting towards contractors but a loss in terms of local knowledge and information?  <\/p> <p>  In terms of responsiveness and the needs of communities, I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that Irish Water's response to elected Members is good.  I am a long-standing critic of Irish Water but I acknowledge that.  I hear from many members of the public that they do not get the same response.  That may not be the case across the board.  It may just be isolated incidents but it would be interesting to know how we determine in respect of the public when they make the call because people often come to us after they have gone to Irish Water or the local authority and not received a response.  It would be interesting to look at that.  <\/p> <p>  I am not necessarily looking for comments on those issues, although I would welcome anything the witnesses have to say about them.  They are some of the answers we will seek in the first report so if it would be helpful if the witnesses could keep that in mind when they are drafting the report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#G00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1537345800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>My question is probably pertinent to Mr. Page.

We are mindful that our function relates to accountability and transparency, and whether Irish Water is performing compared to what it says it is going to do.  I represent the Water Advisory Body but I also work for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  We will draw on whatever we can use from our own work, as will the EPA and An F&oacute;ram Uisce.  We will also have the external view from the two other members of the body.  It is important that the five members act together.  I come back to what is important and why.  Members of the committee have set forth some issues and we will take them on board.<\/p> <p>  I ask members to be patient because holding Irish Water to account across such a range is a tall order.  We expect to deliver four reports per year to this committee.  Each of those reports will not be a full and comprehensive report on every aspect of Irish Water's performance because the data do not get generated with that level of frequency.  Each quarter, we are looking for a theme for a report.  What area might we look at?  If members bear with us, we will try to come up with a reporting structure that will meet the requirements of the committee.  As we interact with the committee, we will take feedback and try to the best of our abilities to do the job with which we have been tasked.  <\/p> <p>  I will try to address a few of the questions that were asked.  Our vision is at the core of what the legislation says.  We recognise that this is about transparency.  It is about holding Irish Water to account to the Oireachtas and the public at large.  There is a huge volume of information out there and there will be increasing amounts of information coming forward from Irish Water.  It is about cutting through that to identify what is important and what people are interested in.  Hearing the views of members today will help us frame that.  <\/p> <p>  How can we can improve communication?<\/p><p>It is only through having reports that cut to the chase and that look at the important issues, and through interacting with the committee as we produce quarterly reports to explain what we have found, that we can identify further areas at which we can look not only on behalf of the Oireachtas, but also on behalf of the public.  <\/p><p> Deputy O'Dowd raised a point about emergencies, which was well made.  As Irish Water would admit, it is learning from the experiences it has had, for example, in respect of the burst pipe at Staleen.  Subsequent to that burst, it identified where it needs to improve.  One would expect of any utility that it should learn.  What has been highlighted by the recent events, in terms of both the cold snap and the drought, is the resilience, or lack of resilience in some instances, of the water system.  That comes down to investment in infrastructure and process and ensuring not only that water and wastewater are processed to quality standards, but also that the capacity is available and conservation is at the core.  That means conservation on both the public side and the user side of the stopcock.  All of these matters are of relevance to the role of the Water Advisory Body as we report to the committee.  <\/p><p> I will just clarify in respect of Deputy O'Dowd's question on our involvement in the water supply project to bring water to the Dublin and eastern region that we do not have a direct role in any project.  Our role is to report and to try to bring some level of transparency and structure to the data and information that exist out there so that we can be much more effective in communicating how well Irish Water is performing against its business plan.  Of course part of that - and this speaks to the issue of operating expenditure, opex, and capital expenditure, capex, which was raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin - is being very clear.  What is the baseline?  What has Irish Water set itself up to achieve and how is it performing against that baseline?  Part of our work is to try to ensure that we are clear about how it is performing, but also about what it is performing against - the targets it has set or the targets that were set for it.<\/p><p> I welcome this interaction with the committee at this first opportunity we have had.  I hope we will have a full complement within a small number of weeks.  I do not know exactly what the timing of that will be, but the committee can rest assured that our focus is on determining when we can produce the first report.  To be clear, after producing the first report, our obligation will then be to do them quarterly.  We want to get this right, but, at the same time, we are conscious that the committee will look for the first report.  I hope it will bear with us.  We will seek to produce it at the earliest opportunity.  We very much look forward to interacting with the committee, taking feedback, and ensuring we can fulfil our statutory function in respect of transparency and accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018091900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537345800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I acknowledge Mr. McGowan's comments but I still have to make my point clearer.  The key failure that might occur in the State in terms of water supply is a collapse in the Dublin system.  The key demand is to make sure that does not happen by being alert and aware and by dealing with public opinion that is opposed to this.  That is a fair comment.  Public opinion in Limerick or wherever the Parteen weir is opposes this.  While I acknowledge and accept that the Water Advisory Body has no role whatsoever in the day-to-day administration, I am referring to the risks and transparency.  If this does not happen, it will lead to an appalling vista.  I acknowledge Mr. McGowan's definitions but the board should have a role in ensuring Irish Water's high priorities.

I am very pleased to be here with my team.  On my right is Ms Carol Baxter and on my left is Ms Sarah Kavanagh.  I am also joined by Mr. John Garry and Ms Caroline Spring.  I am pleased to be here to participate in the pre-legislative consideration of the general scheme of the thirty-eighth amendment of the Constitution Bill.  As the Chairman is aware, I had hoped that we would have been able to hold a referendum this year on what is a fundamental matter of women's equality, namely women's rights to participate equally with men in the public sphere.  I felt all along that this was a really important opportunity and a really good way to commemorate the centenary of women having the right to vote.  I hoped we could remove the final obstacle in our Constitution that suggests the place of women is rightly in the private sphere.  However, I deferred of course to the committee's decision to have hearings on the Government's proposal and other matters.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity therefore to address the committee.  I am here as Minister for Justice and Equality but I also have the experience of being a member of the Constitutional Convention that examined Article 41.2 and made proposals in that regard as the process has informed my approach along with much else.<\/p><p> On 5 July the Government decided that its approach to the referendum question would be to ask the people whether Article 41.2 should be deleted from the Constitution.  It developed its approach to the referendum on the basis of very careful and detailed consideration of the issue.  The referendum in question was discussed twice by the Cabinet and previously by Cabinet committee B.  The Government decided on the option to recommend deletion of Article 41.2 for sound reasons.  First, the issue at the heart of Article 41.2 is one of gender equality, namely whether or not our Constitution states or implies that women have the same rights and freedoms as men in our society.  I regret that the focus on women's equality was lost almost from the start, particularly in an era where there seems to be such public appetite for engagement on issues that affect women.  In this regard, from a legal perspective I was heavily influenced by the lessons of the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  I will come back to that issue shortly.  Gender equality is an important issue.  That aspect appeared to be pushed aside almost immediately by an alternative consideration and concentration on the matter of care, caring and carers.  Of course the issue of caring is really important but the fact that many commentators did not consider it sufficiently important to have a debate on an issue of women's equality is somewhat telling to me.  It suggests that women's issues remain of secondary importance.  There is still some reluctance to afford gender equality the importance it deserves in our public discourse.  That is not the message that we should be conveying to young women and girls in our society.  The future of our society rests on their capabilities as much as it does on young men.<\/p><p> Second, to conflate an issue of women's equality with that of caring bears out something of a stereotype that a woman's role is primarily that of carer, so it was precisely to remove this stereotype once and for all that the Government wished to ask the people whether Article 41.2 should be deleted from our Bunreacht.  Many carers are women but many carers are men so caring is not primarily a gender equality issue.<\/p><p> Third, our strong legal advice was that deleting Article 41.2 carried the fewest risks.  The experience with the eighth amendment is fresh in our minds.  The mess, heartache and societal division created by the eighth amendment remind us how difficult it is to draft constitutional amendments that will stand the test of time.  The Constitution is not a proxy Government nor indeed is it a piece of legislation - it is our foundational legal framework.  It does not work if we insert overly prescriptive provisions in our constitutions.  These may either become outdated quickly or fail to address the range of needs they were intended to address.  Furthermore, the courts may interpret the provisions differently over time than was anticipated.  Again we have experience of that over the years.  The High Court's decision in the case taken by my ministerial colleague, Deputy Zappone against the Revenue Commissioners, seeking recognition of her marriage shows that we cannot always predict with certainty how the courts will interpret our Constitution.  It was that ruling that ultimately necessitated the marriage equality referendum.  I am aware that some people are of the view that the Supreme Court will interpret the Constitution in a way that accords with the aspirations of those people.  Many eminent lawyers point out that the Supreme Court's approach is that constitutional interpretation can evolve over time and can never be predicted with certainty.  It favours the simple deletion of Article 41.2, believing that complex policy matters should be tackled by Government, the Oireachtas and this committee.  Policy is best dealt with by the elected representatives of the people, rather than set in the rigidity of our Constitution.<\/p><p> I am conscious that the Constitutional Convention and the taskforce chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality recommend that Article 41.2 be removed from the Constitution and be replaced with provisions enshrining rights for carers.  I myself was a member of that convention and had some reservations about the depth of analysis regarding some of the recommendations.  However, the convention made its recommendations and these were the starting point for the work of an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality.  That committee examined the convention's recommendations as well as those of the subsequent taskforce.  As I have said, the convention did not examine this issue in great detail.  It was when we began to test each of the options proposed that the complexities of effective constitutional change really became apparent.<\/p><p>I fully recognise the vital contribution made by parents and carers day after day, hour after hour and I meet, and seek to help, many carers in my capacity as a Deputy, as does everybody around this table in their capacity as public representatives.  I recognise that caring work can be arduous and unrelenting and that the negative impact on many carers can be profound.  However, it does not necessarily follow that enshrining a provision in the Constitution is necessarily the most effective way to advance and protect the rights of carers.  I have discussed this issue at length with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, who of course, has policy responsibilities in this area.<\/p><p> Carers are highly diverse.  They may include parents, children, grandparents, grandchildren, siblings, relatives, friends, neighbours, professional carers, childminders, nurses, social workers and doctors.  Some are undertaking caring work on a full-time basis and others are not.  Some perform a caring role on a part-time or intermittent basis.  Some undertake the caring role themselves.  Others pay professional carers to preform specific tasks.  Some are paid for their work and others are unpaid.  The type of constitutional provision that would capture the diversity of carers and of care situations is a real challenge.<\/p><p> Following prolonged discussions, it became abundantly clear to the Government that the issue of care warrants separate and distinct consideration in its own right.  For this reason, the Government decided that this issue should be referred to a citizens' assembly.  We first have to understand precisely what carers need before we jump to the conclusion that the Constitution is the best and most appropriate route.  My colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is best placed to speak to the committee in detail about the State's support for carers.  The combined expenditure on carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance and carer's support grant in 2018 will be &euro;1.15 billion.  The Government introduced two weeks of paternity leave in 2016 and is currently considering the option of introducing paid parental leave for parents.  Government policy supports care.  We have not needed a specific constitutional provision to allocate this level of spending to care-related needs.  Equally, in view of the complexity of care needs and situations, it is clear that legislation agreed by these Houses would be, perhaps, the most appropriate route to deal with this matter.<\/p><p> The interdepartmental committee tasked with recommending specific options for this referendum considered the possibility of modifying Article 41.2 to make it gender neutral so that the contribution of fathers as well as mothers would be recognised.  However, the difficulty was that non-marital families would have been excluded.  The committee will be aware that 38% of children were born into non-marital families in 2017.  When the Government examined this issue, we decided against a proposal which would exclude the contribution of unmarried mothers and fathers.<\/p><p> Some people have proposed other options, for example, inserting a new provision on caring into Article 45.  We also sought extensive legal advice on this proposal.  However, the advice stood that the lessons of the two previous referenda suggested that it was not good practice to insert new language into the Constitution.  Moreover, an addition to Article 45 would be of questionable value given the non-justiciable nature of the article.  Our experience with the eighth amendment reminds us that constitutional change is highly complex and the implications over time unpredictable.  Our approach has been to propose a clear question to the people of Ireland.  In this way, the people can be clear as to the likely implications of their decision.  The Government believes that we owe it to the women of Ireland to propose that the referendum should focus on the issue of gender equality and on removing a provision that seeks to define women's place as solely being in the home carrying out duties.  It was my hope that this referendum would facilitate and encourage real civic engagement with the important issue of gender equality and the work that remains to be done to remove the structural and cultural barriers that continue to discriminate against women in this country.  As Minister, this was my starting point.  While the Government is working to advance gender equality, I would like greater engagement by all sectors of society on this important issue.  <\/p><p> As we move into the second century of female suffrage, our Constitution, which does not seek to define the place of men should not seek to define the place of women on the basis that a woman's place is where she wants it to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#G00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I echo the Chairman's remarks.  I have an open mind in respect of this issue, although I have an inclination towards deletion.  Everyone agrees that the provision is inappropriate, outdated and sexist and that it needs to change.  There is no dispute about that in this room.  The issue is whether the provision should be changed through amendment or deleted.  I note the Minister's point about gender equality.  It is extremely important but I would not like the message to go out, or people to think that, the Constitution does not value, protect and apply gender equality.  The provision in Article 40.1, which has been interpreted many times by the courts, is meaningful and guarantees equality based on gender.  It is important that people do not get the impression that the Constitution does not protect gender equality; it does.  Many cases have been heard by the courts in which they have recognised that Article 40.1 is a guarantee of gender equality.  However, I note the point the Minister makes in respect of this anachronistic provision.<\/p> <p>  The task force, in option 1, put forward a wording which would not create a new right that could be interpreted by the courts but which would still give symbolic non-gender based recognition to the work that is done within the home with the State recognising that home and family life gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.  What was the Minister's reason for rejecting this proposal and deciding to go along with the deletion proposal?  He mentioned that he believes it is a safer option.  The wording set out in option 1 does not open up the possibility that the courts could determine that the people have created a new constitutional right giving rise to financial support to be paid by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#K00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the work of the task force.

I would not like to see the creation of a new constitutional right forcing an obligation on the State to make payments.

It should be viewed in the overall context of a social welfare budget.  I agree with the Minister that I would not like to see any new constitutional right created.  The matter should be dealt with in the Oireachtas.  However, we should not be too negative about symbolism in the Constitution.  Sometimes symbolism is important in politics.  As of yet I have not heard a very strong reason as to why an amended symbolic clause could not be inserted into the Constitution.  Fearfulness of doing it because the courts may interpret it in a different way is an overblown reason, particularly if we are just going to amend the Constitution in accordance with the first option outlined by the task force.<\/p> <p>  These are my general views and I have an open mind on it.

I read everybody else's but we did not get the Minister's speech before the meeting started at 9 a.m.  I have had to make notes, which puts us at a bit of a disadvantage.  It struck me while listening to the Minister that there seemed to be a contradiction in some of the comments.  On the one hand he made the point strongly that this should be excluded entirely and it was an issue of gender equality, so we should not conflate it with caring as that in itself was patronising to women.  He argued that this implies that women are just carers and that although they are not the sole carers, women do the bulk of the work.  He argued that we would be defining it in that sense so it should not be in the Constitution.  However, he then said he would look at a body that could discuss the matter later if we took out the article now.  Perhaps I did not hear that correctly.<\/p><p>The Minister seemed to be saying on the one hand, repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>now but on the other, that he would set up something else to look at caring.  His justification for the repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>now argument was that he did not think caring should be in the Constitution.  That is what I heard although I may be wrong and would like to hear more on that.<br\/><br\/>I am struck by how every organisation and body that examined this issue prior to now recommended replacement.  I do not think we should be wasting time here.  Everybody knows it is sexist and outdated and that it is going to go.  The question is whether it just goes or whether we put something else in.  I am not sure what the problem is because the point the Minister makes about the courts having to interpret the matter applies to everything.  We might as well not have a Constitution then or else we should abolish the courts and the Oireachtas can just legislate for everything.  We have a separation of powers here and it generally works.  The courts generally get it right.  I do not see how that argument really stacks up.  I have an open mind and while symbolism is important, I would like to see something that is more than just symbolic.  Unlike Deputy O'Callaghan, I do not have a problem with that.  The right to free education, for example, is the same type of thing, as far as I am concerned.  Does it mean that everybody gets free education?No, not as such.  Does it mean that everybody gets their education of choice?  No, but the provision does enable some people to access educational supports that they would not get otherwise.  The volume of unpaid labour and the economic value of that labour to the State by those who work in the home and as carers should be recognised.  If there is an economic cost, I do not have a problem with that in the Constitution.  I invite the Minister to comment on that.  I have an open mind although I am erring on the side of replacement because I would like to see something in the Constitution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#L00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I acknowledge what Deputy Clare Daly has said.

I do not see the perceived contradiction in what I said in terms of simple deletion and the work of the Citizens' Assembly.  <\/p> <p>  Caring is very complex and if clauses on caring are to be entered in our Constitution, that will require really careful consideration.  Indeed, that informed the thinking of the Government on going through the various options in considerable detail.  On the matter of the family, references to the family in the current Constitution are really limited and relate only to the marital family.  They do not relate to wider family configurations.  Many caring relationships between siblings, for example, would not be covered in any event.  I want to impress on the committee that these issues were given the most detailed consideration.  These are issues that go back to the early 1990s in terms of an approach that Government might take on what might be put to the people.

I take on board the point made with regard to the eighth amendment but a lot of it comes down to the wording that is selected.  Indeed, at the time many in the legal profession argued that the provision that was put forward was, in itself, something of a contradiction and was deeply flawed from a legal point of view.  It is a question of how right or wrong we get it, technically and with a good wording that has been given proper consideration and is legally tight, there is no reason to be fearful of unintended consequences.  It is just a matter of doing the job correctly and scrutinising any proposal that is made.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to see a new provision inserted that recognises the value of care and is gender neutral.  There is a role for some element of symbolism in the Constitution but having said that, while there are many positive elements in the Constitution, we have been too reluctant to consider positive social and economic rights.  In fact, the one strong positive social and economic right in the Constitution has served us well.  The right to primary education has been applied judiciously and with care by the courts.<\/p><p>There has been a reasonable and sensible application of that provision.  It has meant that parents and families have been able to assert their children's rights to education.  I am thinking particularly of cases that were taken in respect of special education in the 1990s and 2000s.  I think there is a role for that.  I am open to considering whether there is value in a new constitutional provision.  We will consider the various proposals that are advanced.  I think I understand the arguments that are being made in favour of a simple deletion.  I think this issue is worthy of our full consideration.  I look forward to hearing some of the more specific proposals that might be made by certain organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#N00600","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Of course I welcome the views of Deputies and Senators.

After legal advice was received, it was clear that each alternative wording carried difficulties of unintended consequences and different interpretations.  It seemed quite clear to me that deletion represented the pathway forward with the fewest risks.  That is why the Government introduced a proposal to that effect.

I do not have a position on this question.  That is why we are here.  We want to listen to what everyone has to say.  I hope that we will learn more about this matter and that we will be more informed when the time comes to make a call.  I find it amusing that the Minister waxed lyrical in his opening remarks about women's rights and equality in the workplace, given that his Government has done bugger all about the cost of childcare, which is probably the biggest barrier of all.  Ireland currently has the second highest childcare costs in the OECD.  According to an ESRI report that was published earlier this month, \"childcare costs act as more of a barrier to employment for households with lower income\" and \"exclusion from the labour market due to childcare costs will increase poverty risks and household joblessness\".  Recent Governments have actively eroded the rights of mothers who do not work full-time by taking away the child tax credit through tax individualisation and by cutting their pension rights.<\/p> <p>  If the Government were interested in making actual strides in the direction of gender equality, it would introduce legislation on maternity, paternity and family leave, it would invest in publicly subsidised childcare that is affordable and of an appropriate quality, it would provide recognition for care through a universal pension scheme system and it would reform the childcare sector in order that childcare workers are paid more fairly.  Ireland currently spends less on pre-primary education - 0.1% of GDP - than any other EU country.  If we simply delete Article 41.2 from the Constitution, there will be no provision in the Constitution for the role played by carers in the home.  According to Family Carers Ireland, it is estimated that family carers save the State &euro;10 billion a year.  According to Ms Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland, the simple deletion of this wording would carry with it a danger that many people would feel that recognition of their value was also being deleted.  If the Minister and his Government colleagues are so concerned about gender equality and equality for women in the workplace, why have they pursued policies since 2011 that have done the opposite, as far as I can see?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#O00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I do not accept that.

I put it to the Deputy that we have a strong record in responding to the childcare needs of parents.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, received substantial increases in funding in budgets 2017 and 2018.  When I served as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I worked on the development of initiatives like the early years strategy and the single affordable childcare scheme.  The overarching and fundamental point I would like to make about the referendum in my capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality is that this is a gender equality issue rather than a money issue, a finance issue, an education issue or a childcare issue.  I would like to reinforce one particular point by impressing again on the members of the committee that an amendment would have application to a marital family only, due to the article in the Constitution that refers to such a family only.

I am accompanied by my fellow commissioners, Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally and Mr. Frank Conaty.  We welcome the opportunity to share the views of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on this important matter.<\/p> <p>  The commission is Ireland&rsquo;s national human rights institution and equality body.  It was established in 2014 with full institutional independence and a range of statutory powers for which we account directly to the Oireachtas.  A further aspect of the commission&rsquo;s statutory duty is to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality and to make recommendations on measures to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights and equality in the State.  <\/p> <p>  It is in this context that the commission prepared its paper on Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in June this year, which has been circulated to committee members.  We had a formal meeting with both the Ministers for Justice and Equality and  Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 2 July.  The Ministers were presented with this paper in advance of that meeting.  <\/p> <p>  The question of advancing gender equality in the State has been a particular focus of the commission since our establishment in 2014.  The commission has repeatedly raised concerns that in its current format, Article 41.2 perpetuates stereotypical attitudes towards women and their role in society and embeds a value system in our constitutional framework that serves to undermine gender equality.  This is no surprise to this committee.  In the context of the meeting with the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it was made clear by the commission that it did not support the Government's current approach to the constitutional change. <\/p> <p>  The  commission is also of the view that Article 41.2 is not compatible with Ireland&rsquo;s international human rights obligations.  There have been repeated calls by United Nations, UN, treaty monitoring bodies for Ireland to remove or amend the provision, most recently by the UN committee on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, which last year urged Ireland to remove the stereotypical language on the role of women in the home from the Constitution. <\/p> <p>  In approaching how we may address the gender stereotyping currently enshrined in the Constitution, it is important to bear in mind that this debate is not taking place in isolation.  It is part of a critical consideration of how the State defines, recognises and supports the term used in Article 41.2, which is \"the public good\".  This includes the debate about the protection of economic, social and cultural rights, including in the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the meeting with the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the issue of a deliberative process was discussed, with the commission open to the idea of a deliberative process to consider more broadly the debate that needs to be had.  <\/p> <p>  Article 41.2 is at the heart of this discussion of public good.  It has at its core, a recognition of what former Chief Justice, Ms Justice Denham, called an immense benefit for society, that is work in the home, or what we may wish today to more widely understand as care work both in the home and beyond.  The article&rsquo;s assumptions of who carries out this work and where, and what this work entails, may be outmoded but at its heart is a clear recognition of that public good.  The commission, therefore, believes that amending Article 41.2 to render it gender neutral and wider in scope rather than deleting it is a means towards preserving and expanding that important recognition of an important public good in our fundamental law.  That is the first recommendation.  <\/p> <p>  A crucial feature of Article 41.2 is its placement within the rubric of the constitutional protection of the family.  In line with aiming for gender neutrality, the commission broadly supports recommendations to replace references to women and mothers with references to \"family life\".<\/p><p>However, the commission is of the view that in choosing such wording, regard must be had to the wide range of family relationships that are recognised in the State&rsquo;s developing law and social policy, as well as in the context of international human rights law.<\/p><p> A wider conception of family life encompasses a wider range of caring relationships than parenting alone, including beyond the family home.  The commission believes it is possible, and desirable, to amend Article 41.2 to recognise and support care work within this wider understanding of family life.  Ireland is in the process of transformation.  Our population is ageing, our families are smaller and they often come in diverse forms.  In many ways, our current national conversation is seeking to understand how we can ensure our fundamental law catches up, in order to be more reflective of our society.  The commission believes that an opportunity exists to approach reform of Article 41.2 both as an exercise in removing an archaic reference and as a means of introducing a compassionate, generous recognition of the public good realised within Ireland&rsquo;s diverse families and in caring roles.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee again for the invitation to appear today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I will introduce Ms Orla O'Connor and I thank the committee for inviting the National Women's Council of Ireland to speak about the referendum on Article 41.2, commonly referred to as the article on women in the home.<\/p> <p>  The NWCI is the national women&rsquo;s representative organisation, representing more than 190 member organisations across Ireland.

When we ignore their experiences we do so at an enormous cost, to both women and our society.  A successful referendum on Article 41.2 must first be based on a participative and deliberative process for women and men.  If we do not allow enough time for a transparent, participative and respectful process that recognises people&rsquo;s complex identities and feelings, there is a danger of it becoming divisive - divisive between people dedicated to working in the home and those who work inside and outside the home; divisive between those who do unpaid work that contributes to society and those who do paid work; and divisive between families and between women and men who work in the home.<\/p> <p>  A public conversation is necessary in order that the referendum debate can be informed, the issues surrounding the article can be explored and concrete proposals developed which the Government can act on and in regard to which it can be held to account.  We need a clear pathway with real outcomes for women, informed by public discussion.  Recent referendums have offered us a shared path, as citizens, through participation in the debate and through casting our vote.  Through the Constitutional Convention and Citizens' Assembly, we have developed in Ireland sophisticated models of consultation and deliberation where both expert and personal testimony can be heard.  It will be absolutely critical in this public discussion that the experiences of women in all our diversity are heard.<\/p> <p>  Article 41.2, which refers to a woman&rsquo;s life in the home and duties in the home, is undoubtedly sexist and discriminatory.  In practice, the article has been little more than symbolic.  Its placement in the Constitution should have led to a recognition of the value of the contribution women make through unpaid care work in our society.  However, it has faced minimal judicial scrutiny.  It has had little or no impact on the positive formulation of social policy or improving the position of women.  For example, it provided the constitutional and cultural background for the marriage bar and its detrimental impact on women&rsquo;s choices, employment and economic independence, the legacy of which we are still dealing with today.<\/p><p>In practice, Article 41.2 has not supported the home or family; it has merely diminished the position of women.<\/p><p> There have been many deliberations on Article 41.2.  The UN body tasked with examining and upholding women&rsquo;s rights globally, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, has repeatedly criticised Ireland&rsquo;s retention of Article 41.2 in its current form.  It expressed concern at the persistence of traditional stereotypical views of the social roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and in society at large.  CEDAW suggests that the male-oriented language be replaced with gender-sensitive language to convey the concept of gender equality more clearly.<\/p><p> The article has been reviewed extensively in the past, going back to 1996.  All except the Second Commission on the Status of Women in 1993 recommended that the article be amended or replaced to recognise some form of care.  When the members of the 2013 Constitutional Convention, which the National Women's Council of Ireland addressed, voted to express their view 88% said it should not be left as it is and 88% chose to amend or modify it, with only 12% favouring a straight deletion.  The most recent Government task force recommended options for the insertion of language regarding care and recommended an option to place new text in Article 45.<\/p><p> Over the years, the NWCI has consulted widely with our members.  It is clear from all our conversations with our members that everyone is agreed that there is no place for discrimination in our Constitution.  It was opposed in 1937 by women activists and feminists and it has no place in today&rsquo;s Ireland.  In our consultations there was no disagreement regarding the need for the sexist language in Article 41.2 to go.  On this matter, everyone agrees.  However, once we move on from the sexist language and the positioning of women in the home, our discussions around Article 41.2 move quickly to the complex choices and challenges that many of us face every day.  These issues relate to our understanding of family and home, the roles of women and men, economic supports for parents and work-life balance and the contribution of care and carers.<\/p><p> Views expressed by our members on the article also quickly move to the need for adequate provision of supports and time to care and to be cared for, both inside and outside the home.  There is also a very strong argument that those receiving care need to be recognised within that relationship, and valued to the same extent as those providing care.  The discussion on this article is complex and connects to a broad range of issues that need to be considered when proposing a referendum.<\/p><p> The issue of care is central to women&rsquo;s equality and the NWCI recognises the complexity of issues when we discuss the area of care.  In all the discussions on Article 41.2, the NWCI has advocated for the need to recognise and to value care in our society.  Care work is essential to the common good; it performs vital social and economic functions.  Recognition and valuing of affective care is fundamental to full equality for women.  Affective care refers to human dependence and interdependence and the right to give and receive love and care.<\/p><p> One of the key challenges is that while there has been a significant increase in women&rsquo;s participation in the labour market, this has not been balanced by any increase in the contribution of men to domestic or care work.  Nor has there been an adequate State response through recognition of, or investment in, care work.  We are concerned that the current discussion on care and Article 41.2 is being narrowed to a consideration of carers, which is only one aspect of care and affective equality and could lead to what the Taoiseach has referred to as a hierarchy of rights, which is not the intention of NWCI.<\/p><p> The NWCI members are also very conscious of the context of Article 41.2.  Article 41 includes a definition of the family which does not reflect the reality of families in Ireland nor the diversity of family life.  It presumes a male breadwinner and a two-parent household where a woman stays at home and it does not take into account the reality of the many LGBT families and one-parent families.<\/p><p> The NWCI considers that the role of affective care in the achievement of equality should be recognised and supported through a combination of constitutional, legislative and policy change.<\/p><p>We know social change can have complex personal impacts that deserve consideration and respect.  We need time for a public conversation that considers any proposed new wording and any accompanying legislation.  We believe this process needs to begin immediately so we can proceed with holding the referendum in 2019.  We ask the committee to recommend to the Government that a public consultation or conversation is established to consider a combination of constitutional and legislative change options that recognise the importance of care in its full form and that enough time and resources are provided to help the public understand and discuss the proposed changes and their implications.  We ask for this to happen before a referendum is held.  We have not suggested in our submission a particular form for the public consultation but it could be along the lines of how the Citizens' Assembly dealt with the eighth amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il as an gcuireadh a bheith anseo.  It was a very sensible decision to undertake scrutiny and have a considered discussion on this issue before presenting a<i>fait accompli<\/i>to the people.  I have made a longer written submission, which considers the history of the provision, that members may find of use.<br\/><br\/>I will concentrate on the main question for committee members to consider which is, as far as I see it, what the purpose of the provision should be.  The major downfall of the existing provision is that it was never clear whether it was intended to be purely symbolic or whether concrete rights should flow from it.  Because this was never challenged in the courts it has effectively been useless in law.  We are all agreed there is no reasonable argument for keeping the provision.  The gendered and paternalistic language is an obvious problem.  Because of the history of the provision, at this stage it is not very likely it will ever have any effect in law.  It is also an embarrassment in this day and age to have such insulting language in the Constitution.  When international lawyers read our basic law they are always taken aback by this provision.<br\/><br\/>The question is not whether the provision should be repealed, it is whether repeal <i>simpliciter <\/i>or a replacement is more appropriate.  This is where the issue of purpose comes in and I will elaborate on this.  If it is decided to replace the provision rather than simply repeal it, essentially two options are available.  The first option is to insert a replacement provision along the lines suggested by the Department of Justice and Equality's taskforce.  This would include gender neutral language acknowledging the important role played by carers in the home and a sentence to the effect that the State would endeavour to support such persons.  This type of language would not automatically create any socioeconomic rights for carers and would avoid financial consequences for the State.  However, in terms of the purpose of the provision, we would have to decide what the aim of such a replacement would be.  Would it be to include a symbolic reference to carers to acknowledge the role they play in the home, and possibly use the provision as a motivation to encourage the Oireachtas to pass new legislation to create stronger statutory rights?  This would be the effect of such a provision.  A symbolic provision in the Constitution is of limited value since it would not create any concrete constitutional right.  However, some civil society groups have argued that it could be useful, when trying to encourage the Government to pass legislation on certain issues, to be able to point to a constitutional provision as encouragement for the reform, even if is a symbolic provision and the Constitution does not actively demand it.  It may be worth pointing out the existing provision has not been of much use in this regard.<br\/><br\/>If the aim of the provision were to be to have a constitutional symbol that would encourage the creation of legislative rights, perhaps a better location for the provision would be in Article 45, which contains the directive principles of social policy.  These are non-justiciable, which means they cannot be made the subject of a court action and thus rights do not automatically arise from them.  This would make it clear that the aim was symbolic and it would also avoid any question around restrictions regarding the marital family in Article 41.  If the provision is left in Article 41, which is the section on the family, there will always be a question mark over whether a judicial interpretation would be given that would impose an economic obligation on the State.<\/p><p>This is the fear of the Minister.  This is not very likely, given the words \"endeavour to support\" and the fact that carer supports are already provided for, to a certain extent, in legislation but the possibility always remains.<\/p><p> The second option would be to aim to create a constitutional right by replacing the existing provision with a stronger version, which would be gender neutral but which would commit the State to supporting the work of carers in the home in economic terms, thus creating a concrete constitutional right in Article 41.  This could be achieved by wording such as \"the State shall ensure that persons caring for others in the home will be supported\".  It would be unusual to tie the hands of the Government in this way.  According to the normal separation of powers theory, it is the Executive that determines matters of budgetary policy.  As has already been mentioned, we already have one existing socioeconomic right clearly set out in the Constitution, which is the right to free primary education.  This obviously imposes a financial burden on the State.  We have heard many arguments about other socioeconomic rights that could be incorporated into the Constitution.<\/p><p> We must bear in mind that ultimately the people are the true masters of the Constitution and if they were to vote such a provision into the Constitution there could be no issue about its constitutionality despite the fact it would be unusual under the normal separation of powers theory.  Certainly there would be no constitutional bar to creating such an economic right.  It comes down to the issue of purpose.  Do we wish to replace the provision with one that would be more cosmetically attractive and could be used to influence legislation or do we want to go further and replace it with a strong provision to ensure carers are sufficiently supported but would involve a restriction in the budgetary power of the Executive and could have significant financial consequences?<\/p><p> There is always the third option, which has already been proposed by the Government, to remove the provision and not replace it.  This is certainly the easier option as far as the Government is concerned, because while something is in the Constitution there is always the possibility of an unexpected or unintended interpretation by the courts.  The Attorney General and constitutional experts can give opinions but, ultimately, the Constitution means whatever the courts say it means.  Until we have a conclusive opinion from the courts we can never be absolutely certain of the effect that any particular provision will have.  Removing the provision and not replacing it removes the risk that any replacement provision will ever have any unintended legal consequence.  It comes down to whether Members of the Oireachtas want to create a new provision that would have legal consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Cahillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses.

Much of what I have heard has confirmed my reason for supporting the view that the committee and Oireachtas should recommend simple straightforward deletion, which is the complexity of the issue and the fact there are multiple ways in which we could approach this if we do not go for straight deletion.<\/p> <p>  As has been very clearly outlined by Dr. Cahillane in her contribution, we could go with various options but these would create problems.  I am interested to hear from people advocating for something different from my view.  If we opt to replace it with a provision that has no effective obligation but is just a statement we run the risk of alienating a number of people who would like to see something stronger.  If we replace it with something that confers obligations, I will refer to this as the \"shall\" option, we run the same risk in the opposite way.<\/p><p>It is an absolute nightmare to hold a referendum, about which everybody agrees, to remove something which should not be there.  In such cases the referendum gets caught up in the politics of the issue, although we cannot envisage what that will involve at this point, and this can result in the referendum being lost.  That would be regrettable.  We would be going beyond a question of straight deletion and getting involved in myriad other views and opinions.  My view is that it is the role of the Oireachtas to provide the necessary guidance, and to bring forward legislation according to policies decided by a majority of Members.  If they are changed by the public at an election, so be it.  In light of the experience this country has had, I am very cautious about this.  No matter how well thought out it is and no matter how well legally advised we are that it can create a solution to something, it is a very precarious road to go down.  In the case of the eighth amendment, we effectively handed over power to the Judiciary and to its interpretation of the situation.<\/p><p> What do the witnesses think of the argument for replacing the article?

I do not feel that complexity should stop us from doing something now as opposed to down the road.  It will take consideration and consultation but, from the perspective of caring, there is no doubt about the stereotypical language in terms of gender and role.  I believe a lot of people are aware of what caring means and where carers are coming from in this context, but I will dig into it a little bit further.  Caring does not just involve an individual providing care and a person receiving care.  It typically involves a family and encompasses everything to do with the family.<\/p><p>It impacts the entire fabric of family emotionally, physically and economically.  We can put metrics on the contribution carers make, and it is important to do so, but sometimes the contributions onto which we cannot put metrics are even more important.  We need to address two aspects of the role of carers: recognition and support.  Recognition is important because, even if it is symbolic, symbols can be important.  Symbols can also, however, be empty if they are not accompanied by support.  The role of carers in society and their contribution to us as a nation is immense and deserves recognition.  We have an opportunity to do that and even if, being complex, it requires consultation or if there are issues requiring definitions as to boundaries as a result of an economic impact, we nevertheless need to take it seriously.  We need to have the courage to deal with it in that context.<\/p><p> There is no impediment to engaging with this aspect in isolation from the amendment or Article 41.2.  We need to be brave and to amend the article.  We need to look at what family life is within the article as well as the role of carers, parents and other family members and how we support them as they contribute to society.  This also includes siblings, sons, daughters and a wide variety of people who care within a family context.  We should take this opportunity to recognise carers while dealing with the stereotypical language around gender and role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#Z00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Conaty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>If we separated the two issues and held the referendum first, we would put the cart before the horse.

The Minister referred to legal advice but has refused to publish it.  It is most likely that the Attorney General would have said that one cannot write off a constitutional provision.  It has been useless in law because no rights have ever flowed from it, nor any legislation passed as a result of it.  In the Sinnott case, Mr. Justice Geoghegan said that, in an appropriate situation, a woman could claim a breach of her rights under Article 41.2, which indicates that it is not closed off forever.  A replacement provision could have the same effect, which could be good or bad depending on one's point of view, but we should not be afraid of amending the Constitution simply because we are not quite sure what a court will say in 20, 30 or 50 years' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I do not favour amending the Constitution at all.

This is interesting but I am not being facetious in saying that, having listened to the debate, I am now more convinced of the need for a replacement.  The options presented by Dr. Laura Cahillane are very clear.  We either take out the provision and include one that is symbolic or we put something in that gives more economic and social rights.  I am cognisant that the commission is a statutory body and separate from the others but the support for the starting point of the Constitution being a document for the public good is such that the huge area of work involved deserves a mention.  I will not waffle on about my opinion on the matter because we will definitely not resolve the issue here.  I would like the opinion of the panel on pointing a way forward, which is something we could do.  Do the delegates believe that, in our report, we could recommend, for example, the establishment of a citizens&rsquo; assembly, the sanctioning of finances for it and the setting of a timescale sufficient to enable the process to tie in with the local and European elections?  The decisions on funding would be left to the Oireachtas.  I am curious about this.  Could the witnesses add anything on this?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in Dr. Laura Cahillane's point of view.  She referred, on the one hand, to how it might be better to put the wording into Article 45 and referred, on the other, to how it might not.  Have the witnesses a view regarding the family?  The Minister suggested an argument I had not heard, namely, that if we included \"family life\" it would only cover married family life, be it the married family life of same-sex couples or otherwise.  One would have to be married, however, to enjoy the benefits.  There could be a problem with the idea of \"family life\" in that context.  How would the witnesses get around that?  This matter seems to be key.  Those were my two questions.  I hope I will be able to come back to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#BB00900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>We will open up the debate.

It was also in connection with considering women's participation in life.  Therefore, it was very tight and there was not a lot of room for discussion.  We would like to see a process similar to that on the eighth amendment.  On the question of whether what is desired could be done by May, the timeframe would be tight.  We are conscious of that.  The Minister mentioned the other referendum on divorce.  Maybe it fits with that.  It can be done in 2019; however; we would be clear about that.  We would want it done in that way.<\/p> <p>  We also raised the definition of the \"family\" in the Constitution.  That is why we are open to examining Article 45.

On the point about directive principles the commission is concerned that this would not allow for a strict enough or positive enough obligation on the State to support carers' roles and their work because of the way the directive principles have been interpreted, which is in our view too limiting.<br\/><br\/>With regard to Article 41 and the definition and construction of the family, and the specific role given to the marital family, our longer policy document which was published in June 2018 and which I hope is available to everyone cites Mr. Justice Hogan in the RX case in 2010 in the High Court, who was of the view that the Constitution, and specifically Article 41, was not closed off from providing protection under certain circumstances to other close relatives outside of the specific scope of marriage.  In our policy document and elsewhere we have cited Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the interpretation given there to family life.  We presume that in the Constitution there is compliance with international law unless a clear indication is given otherwise.<br\/><br\/>There is the further question of the whole allocation of resources, socioeconomic rights and separation of powers, which has come up a number of times.  We note that the vindication and protection of civil and political rights is a highly complex matter.  Some examples include the right to a fair trial, access to the courts and administration of justice.  There are differing views on the scope and limits of those rights, and it requires huge allocation of resources on the part of the State to vindicate the right to a fair trial, for example.  The allocation of resources and decisions around that is essentially connected to the protection of any right, whether it is categorised in a traditional way as civil and political or as economic and social.  <br\/><br\/>As already mentioned the right to an education is explicitly recognised in the Constitution but our courts have also recognised other socio-economic rights.  The right to seek employment, for example, was recently recognised for asylum seekers by the Supreme Court in the NHV case, in which the commission was an <i>amicus curiae<\/i>, and in which the Supreme Court cited a general comment of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was a first in the Irish courts.  Economic, social and cultural rights were recognised there as being of progressive implementation but nonetheless positive obligations are imposed on the State.

As Professor Mullally has said, the human rights commission's fear is that it would not provide strong obligations for the State.  The point is that Article 45 is a symbolic provision.  There have been times the courts have used Article 45 to refer to unenumerated rights but generally Article 45 is not something which leads to concrete constitutional rights.  That would be a solution if the committee felt that a symbolic provision was more appropriate and did not want to go forward with a concrete provision which would grant economic rights to carers.<\/p><p> On the marital family issue, it is difficult in that Article 41 has been interpreted by the courts to refer to the marital family.  Where the family is given protection in the Constitution it is only the marital family which is given protection.  The Constitution does not say that but because it gives special protection to marriage it has been interpreted by the courts as meaning that the family has to be a family based on marriage.  There is always room for interpretation there.  One hopes the courts would give an updated meaning to a provision in Article 41 to include families other than marital families, but that definition has been ingrained in the Constitution until now.  It is slightly off point but a much more meaningful amendment to the Constitution would be to amend Article 41 to change that definition in order that a de facto family would be recognised, rather than a marital family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Cahillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I call Deputy O'Callaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#DD00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.

It has been a useful exchange.  It showed why it was important to have this pre-legislative scrutiny.  What Dr. Conaty said earlier struck me in terms of the roles of carers and how we identify carers and what care is.  It takes many different forms and comes in many different guises.  I am similarly of a view that the sexist nature of what has prevailed needs to change.  I am thinking about the symbolic recognition of care and carers and how important that is.<\/p><p>It is complex if we want to do it justice because not only do we have the competing views of women and men and gender neutrality but we also have an increasing number of children and elderly people caring for disabled children or people with specific needs and requirements.  Many carers face feelings of isolation and marginalisation.  Symbolism can address that to some extent but in terms of their daily bread and butter it can be down to the legislative flow that might be required.  What are the arguments relating to access and benefits and how we tangibly support carers?  Children cannot open bank accounts, for example, so it is a complex issue.  I appreciate that I have not formulated all of this in my head.  It is something separate that struck me from the conversation and questions thus far.  <\/p><p> I will try to put it into the form of a question.  Are the witnesses aware of any other examples of good practice internationally where states have included the symbolic nature of care and a constitutional recognition of care?  Care does not always prevail within the family.  We probably all know of instances of community care where neighbours look after more vulnerable people within their community.  That constitutional recognition of solidarity and support and care is important.

It provides a starting point to expand it and remove the discriminatory element.  It would allow us to ground what is behind that, which is to recognise the value of care and caring work in the context of family life.  That is what we are trying to build on and, in doing that, we would draw on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Our recent ratification of the CRPD gives another context to that as well.  They are the kinds of international human rights obligations and obligations with regard to social security and caring more broadly that can ground it.  The specific details are a matter for the Legislature, as is currently the case regarding payments around disability support, support for childcare and the work of carers.

Any rights vindication issue, such as the right to a fair trial, requires the State and the Legislature to engage in difficult decisions on resource allocations.  Any question on rights, whether we categorise them in a rather traditional way as civil and political or socio-economic, requires an allocation on the part of the State and decisions about resources.  The adjudication by courts will also inevitably lead to those consequences.  We need a framework within which those decisions are made to effectively vindicate that right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#MM00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I have one question.

We think it is important that this be included in the provision.  That is why our own wording in the Constitutional Convention referred to persons caring.  That is important.  We are proposing recognition of care in a gender-neutral frame, which recognises that it is important for men and women, for all people in society.
