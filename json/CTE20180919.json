As the Chairperson said, I am a member of the Medical Council.  I am also the chairperson of the working group which is reviewing the section relating to abortion in the Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners.  I am joined today by Mr. Bill Prasifka, CEO of the Medical Council.  We are here to discuss the council&rsquo;s role in regard to this important issue, so I will begin by giving a quick outline of the council&rsquo;s responsibilities and functions which are particularly relevant in the context of the referendum result and pending legislative changes.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of doctors within the Republic of Ireland.  Its purpose is to protect the public by promoting and ensuring the highest standards among doctors.  The council works to ensure that medical education and training is always up-to-date and is benchmarked against the highest international standards.  Standards for undergraduate and postgraduate training are set by the Medical Council.  The council also requires doctors to maintain their professional competency through updating and maintaining their professional skills on an ongoing basis.  The Medical Council is also where the public may make a complaint against a doctor.<\/p> <p>  The principal functions of the Medical Council relate to the control of standards of education and training at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, the registration of medical practitioners in accordance with their education and training, the determination of questions of professional misconduct or fitness to practise and the operation of EU directives relating to education and training in the practise of medicine.  The Medical Council also provides guidance to doctors on matters relating to conduct and ethics through its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners.  In summary, the key objective of the council is to protect the interests of the general public in their interactions with registered medical practitioners while also supporting doctors.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Medical Council&rsquo;s role following the referendum result and pending legislative changes, it should be noted that the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 requires the council to, among other things, provide appropriate guidance on all matters relating to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners.  However, it is the role of the postgraduate training bodies to set clinical guidelines.  The Medical Council sets out ethical guidelines for registered medical practitioners in its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners, the current or eighth edition of which was published in 2016.  This guide is regularly reviewed and updated when there is a relevant change in legislation.  Section 48 of the 2016 edition details guidance on doctor&rsquo;s actions around abortion.  However, the guidance currently relates to the situation prior to the referendum result and will need to be adjusted and updated in the context of upcoming changes in legislation.  Section 49 of the current guide puts forward guidance for conscientious objection from a doctor.  This section is also of a particular relevance to the changes in legislation and will also be reviewed and updated as appropriate.  Sections 48 and 49 of the guide and a full copy of the guidance were provided to the committee as supplementary information in advance of this meeting.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council term of 2018 to 2023 has recently begun and reviewing the ethical guide in light of the referendum results was a key item on the agenda for the first meeting.  During this first meeting, the council came to the decision to establish a working group to review the guide as there are sections which will need to be updated or changed following the referendum result.  The procedure for a section of the Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners to be updated would normally be for a council committee or working group to review relevant information relating to the topic, be it research or new legislation, consult with key stakeholders and then draft guidance on the matter.  Once the council is happy with the draft wording, further targeted consultation would normally take place and any feedback would then be taken into consideration.  Final proposed guidance would then be brought to the full Medical Council meeting to be decided on.  This ethical guidance from the Medical Council is for the use of doctors and should be followed in conjunction with the clinical guidelines set out by the postgraduate training bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council is happy to keep the members of the Joint Committee on Health updated throughout the process.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address members today.  We are happy to address any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Suzanne Crowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Crowe.

The ICGP acknowledges that changes that will be required by the outcome of the May 2018 referendum on the repeal of the 8th amendment.  As a result of the referendum outcome, a patient centred clinical care pathway for termination of pregnancy as part of a comprehensive reproductive and sexual health service that is appropriately resourced will be required in Ireland.  The proposed legislation on this matter needs to be accompanied by measures and policies which aim to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy and provide support for those who experience it, including comprehensive contraceptive services and sexual health education programmes.<\/p> <p>  The result of this referendum has created a new reality.  What has principally changed is that terminations of pregnancy which were previously undertaken in another jurisdiction will now be carried out in Ireland.  How this is done, the standards and quality of care, the legal implications and the supports given to women at a difficult time is of concern to all of us.  As healthcare professionals, it is imperative that we engage to ensure a safe and workable outcome.  Our college needs to be part of designing the service and we would like to do so with our colleagues in the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.<\/p> <p>  More detailed information is needed to inform legislators and to enable the Department of Health, together with the postgraduate training bodies and the representative bodies, to comprehensively draw up the detail and resourcing of services for those with unwanted pregnancies.  Whichever model of care is developed, the patient must be front and centre in the required clinical care pathway.  To ensure the delivery of safe, high quality and timely services to our patients, a series of critically interconnected elements will clearly need to be in place.<\/p><p>These will include the following: legislation; clinical guidelines and clinical care pathways; the licensing of appropriate medications; secondary care referral pathways clearly delineated and resourced; community-based opt-in provision; clarification regarding medical indemnity, if there is any; Medical Council guidelines; and a 24-hour helpline that includes a clear referral pathway to a known community provider, referral to in-person counselling, if required, expert advice to pre and post-termination expectations of care and complications and triage out-of-hours advice to address patient concerns and side effects, post-procedure, with onward referral to medical follow-up, if that were to be required.<\/p><p> This opening statement summarises the work, which may change as new evidence arises, required to address the pertinent concerns such as ultrasound and blood typing, and it summarises key elements of a clinical care pathway.  Termination of pregnancy will be legalised for the first time in Ireland.  Few clinicians are trained to deliver this clinical care pathway, unless they received training outside this jurisdiction.  Naturally, this leads to concerns about patient safety in community-based provision of this new service.  To address these concerns, and to generate solutions in the design of a termination of pregnancy service, the college undertook an electronic member engagement process, which does not close until the end of this week.<\/p><p> We have received some good and innovative suggestions for how a service might be offered.  Clinical guidelines need to capture the full clinical care pathway from initial appointment to follow-up care post-termination.  Clinical guidelines would map to the expected legislation and would undergo the usual best-practice rigorous review process in the college.  GPs would prefer an opt-in mechanism by which they choose to provide this clinical care pathway.  Clinical guidelines would be expected to address the totality of care provision, including appropriate means of confirming and dating a pregnancy, medical termination of pregnancy for those at up to nine weeks&rsquo; gestation, consideration of the additional complexities of providing medical termination of pregnancy at up to 12 weeks&rsquo; gestation, and secondary referral to hospital care where required in complex cases or cases where there is uncertainty about dates, known risk factors, etc.  Following discussion of all the options available to her, the final decision about whether to undergo a medical or surgical termination of pregnancy should be the woman&rsquo;s own choice and the appropriate informed consent obtained.<\/p><p> The evidence base on the need for administration of anti-D and the need for ultrasound scanning is becoming clearer and the guidelines would clarify these issues.  If ultrasound is required, rapid access to this facility, including the expert provision and interpretation of sonographs, will be a critical element of the pathway.  A 24-hour helpline, staffed by appropriately trained clinical staff will be required.  This helpline will serve a dual purpose, namely, to provide immediate access to clinical information and care to those with a crisis pregnancy who are considering termination, and to provide post-termination assistance to answer specific questions and make onward referral for care as indicated.  Whether GPs wish to provide this service, college members have expressed concerns regarding capacity and resourcing challenges such as staffing, facilities and training; the potential lack of appropriate specialist support; the possibility of medical complications for their patients; the public reaction for those who choose to provide and those who do not choose to provide this clinical care pathway; and a fear of litigation.  They wish to see an acknowledgement of conscientious objection and how to accommodate this in the care pathway, and an acknowledgement of conscientious commitment and how to support this in the care pathway.  There needs to be an integrated and resourced contraceptive service, provided to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancies.  They want clinical care pathways to keep the patient central to the service and be free at the point of care.  They have concerns about the remuneration for service providers and desire a commitment from the Department of Health to a timeline within which a woman can expect to receive a service.<\/p><p> This is a significant juncture in medical care in Ireland.  We have an opportunity to ensure the provision of a safe, best-practice, appropriately resourced, patient-centred termination of pregnancy clinical care pathway.  The ICGP looks forward to playing a significant role in the development of this pathway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>We welcome the opportunity to address the committee and to discuss the matter of clinical guidelines being prepared in light of the impending introduction of abortion services in Ireland.  The IOG is the national professional and training body for obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland.  Members of the institute are drawn from all 19 maternity hospitals and units throughout the country.  In April this year, the IOG set up a number of working groups to establish principles to underpin the development of guidelines for legislation for abortion services in Ireland in the event of successful repeal of the eighth amendment.  More than 50 members of the institute volunteered to participate in the development of guidelines.  Members have visited units in Scotland, England and Norway where abortion care is integrated into the health system.  Clearly, the legislative process is not yet complete, so the IOG working groups are drafting guidelines on the basis of what has been proposed to date by the Minister of Health.  Guidelines will be completed when the final legislation is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The following workstreams have been established: early pregnancy; threat to life and health of the mother; fetal medicine; conscientious objection; and staff training. I will comment on the some of the general principles that we are following.  To deliver fit-for-purpose services for termination of pregnancy in Ireland, the institute recommends that services should be free to all at the point of delivery and funding for the service, as with all women&rsquo;s healthcare, should be appropriately resourced and ring-fenced.  International experience, supported by data, is that following legalisation of abortion services, numbers decline with the passage of time for a variety of reasons, including the removal of barriers to access and when the service includes advice on, and provision of, contraception.  The IOG, therefore, strongly supports the proposals of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and the Minister for Health&rsquo;s proposal that every effort should be made to reduce crisis pregnancies, including by the provision of free contraception.<\/p> <p>  Early pregnancy is defined as the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, that is 12 weeks after the woman&rsquo;s last menstrual period and, on average, ten weeks post-conception.  We have looked to the example of Scotland, a country with a similar population to Ireland, for data on termination services.  In Scotland, approximately 75% of terminations are at less than nine weeks and 91% of these are medically induced.  Approximately 10% require hospital attendance because of complications.  We believe that Irish figures should be in line with those of Scotland.<\/p> <p>  In line with international best practice, it is proposed that early medical abortion, at less than nine weeks' pregnancy, takes place in the community.  Although routine pre-termination ultrasound scanning is not recommended as mandatory in international guidelines, it is performed in most circumstances where it is readily available, and always if there are concerns about dates or ectopic pregnancy, or if the woman chooses.  In Ireland, however, we are only too well aware of the well-documented infrastructural deficits in access to ultrasound in pregnancy.  Introduction of a termination service without adequate scanning facilities is fraught with risk, and the IOG, therefore, recommends that appropriate and immediate investment in ultrasound is an integral element of termination services.  After nine weeks, and before 12 completed weeks, it is recommended that medical termination takes place in the hospital setting due to the increased risk of complications such as bleeding.  It is likely that a proportion of women will choose a surgical option for practical reasons.  Risks and benefits of both methods will be explained.<\/p> <p>  The IOG recommends that a 24-7 helpline be established to help with appointments, provide reassurance, and provide information if a woman is concerned about any aspect of her care such as where to go in the case of a complication.  The proposed three-day interval between the first consultation and initiating the termination is not supported by evidence; it may act as a barrier and it makes unwarranted assumptions about women&rsquo;s ability to make their own decisions.  There is evidence that those who request termination remain satisfied with their decision.  A waiting time, if any, should be from the time of first contact with the service.<\/p> <p>  Contraceptive advice and services, including long-acting options, should be available at the time of the termination.  Blood tests for anaemia, blood group and HCG, if appropriate, should be taken at the time of first consultation.  It may also be appropriate to test for sexually transmitted infections in certain circumstances.  On the threat to life or health of the pregnant woman, any woman whose life is at risk or where there is a serious risk to her health will be in hospital already.  Since the introduction of the Protection of Life in Pregnancy Act in 2013, experience has been gained in the performance of termination in hospitals and, therefore, current practice need not alter.<\/p> <p>  Foetal medicine and termination for a lethal foetal abnormality will take place in hospitals.  The medical procedures will be the same as for those performed for the risk to life or health.  It is envisaged that medical management with Mifepristone and Misoprostol will treat the majority of cases.<\/p><p>Termination for foetal abnormality currently takes place outside the State.  Diagnosis in Ireland is almost exclusively based on ultrasound.  In the United States and Europe, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is the standard of care.  It is useful in complex anomalies to confirm or exclude pathologies suggested by ultrasound.  MRI results can change a diagnosis from fatal to life limiting and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The overall diagnostic accuracy of MRI is 93% compared to 68% for ultrasound.  Thus, when MRI is used, further to initial ultrasound, additional information is provided in 50% of cases, the diagnosis is changed in 35% of cases, medical management is changed in 33% of cases and prognosis is changed in 20% of cases.  MRI is currently only available in one maternity hospital in the country.  The IOG recommends funding to expand access to foetal MRI.  <br\/><br\/>The Medical Council has clear guidelines on conscientious objection.  In section 49 of the current guide - I will not read it out - if a doctor has a conscientious objection to treatment then he or she has a duty to transfer care to another doctor.  In an emergency there is no option but to give care.  We see no reason to change these guidelines but we understand that the Medical Council is looking at them.  Section 50 deals with current termination services in Ireland and will need to be updated once the legislative process relating to abortion is completed.  We draw attention to the fact that the document on the professional refusal to provide abortion care on grounds of conscientious objection and European human rights jurisprudence on State obligations to guarantee women's access to legal reproductive healthcare has a human rights perspective.  It states that, at a minimum, the State must ensure the adequate availability and dispersal of willing providers, prohibit institutional refusal of care, establish effective referral systems, disseminate information on legal entitlements to abortion care, impose clear limits on the legality of refusals and implement adequate monitoring oversight and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with relevant regulations.<br\/><br\/>We want to be sure that the system is not set up to fail as we have seen already with other systems.  On staff training, the institute has already begun organising courses for staff training on techniques not currently performed in Ireland and education on abortion care is being introduced into postgraduate training programmes for doctors.  I understand that it will also be introduced into undergraduate programmes.  A separate educational programme based on conscience and values is recommended for all whether directly involved in abortion care or not.  Abortion care in Ireland will be a significant change for all healthcare professionals.  In view of this, we recommend the establishment of an abortion provider's network to include nurses and midwives who will be integral to the delivery of woman centred care.  I thank the committee and will be happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Boylan.  To start, I would like to ask two questions.  On the heads of the general scheme of the Bill, published in July of this year, which is the only document that we have to work on at the moment because we do not have the legislation yet, in head 7 in relation to early pregnancy, there is a requirement that the medical practitioner forms an opinion in good faith that the pregnancy concerned is not in excess of 12 weeks.  Is Dr. Boylan making a distinction between nine weeks and 12 weeks in that after nine weeks it should occur in a hospital setting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Yes, that is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The second part of the question is on the three day period from initial consultation to confirming that the woman wants to proceed with her termination.

Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Yes, it is.  I will address head 7 on nine and 12 weeks first of all.  Beyond nine weeks the rate of complication such as bleeding and perhaps a need for surgical completion increases and, therefore, it is not appropriate that should be carried out in the community.  Most of the early terminations, in fact the vast majority, will take place in the woman's own home, in her own environment wherever she wishes to be.  That is not appropriate if there is a high rate of complications from a patient safety point of view and so from nine to 12 weeks women will require hospital management.  That raises the question of ultrasound as a dating mechanism.  Figures vary but in Scotland, for example, about 30% of women will require a scan for uncertain dates and it will probably be something similar here.  We have to be very careful in this country when introducing this service that there are no hiccups or adverse outcomes so we recommend that the majority of women would have access to an ultrasound scan if necessary or if the doctor feels that it is necessary.  That will require a significant beefing up of ultrasound availability to doctors working in the community and to doctors in general.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the three day waiting period, there is not really any evidence that it is necessary.  There are mixed opinions about it obviously and in some countries in Europe, the Netherlands for example, there is a waiting period between the time of first consultation and the actual termination of pregnancy.  There is not, however, any evidence that it is necessary and it also makes presumptions about women's ability to make decisions about their own healthcare.  We have heard much about paternalism and attitudes to women recently in light of the CervicalCheck problems so while there will be mixed views about it, many doctors feel that it is not in fact absolutely necessary and perhaps should be dropped.  That is, however, a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Boylan.

Between nine weeks and 12 weeks, as Dr. Boylan has said, complications become more problematic and there are more dating issues.  We will need a very careful well elaborated pathway.  When we talk about clinical care pathways we mean how to plot the journey a woman takes from the beginning through to the end of a service so that there is an expectation by the clinician providing the care of what that service will be.  When we talk about guidance and clinical guidance we mean that we set up a section, a written education reference structure, so that clinicians can understand what they are doing.  We will need careful clinical guidance, which we would develop with the institute, we will need very careful clinical care pathways and we will need significant resourcing.

The opening statements were very useful.  I want to ask all three groups about timing.  This a complex issue.  It is the first time we have done this in Ireland and there is much complexity involved for all three organisations.  The Medical Council needs to work through the ethical guidelines carefully.  By my count there were about six steps in the process between stakeholder reviews, drafts, integrating feedback, coming back together and finally publishing.  That is a comprehensive process.  The steps outlined for GPs are wideranging.  There is legislation, which we will all work on together, there are care pathways from primary to secondary, there is licensing of medications and availability of medications, there are 24-hour helplines, there is some way for people to opt in or out, whatever way it ends up, there is clarification on medical indemnity, which is obviously a hot topic at the moment, there are Medical Council guidelines and so on.  There is an awful lot.<\/p><p>Some GPs and obstetricians I have spoken with recently are very worried about the amount of work to be done within the timetable that has been stated by the Government which is that this would be operational on the ground by January.  The Medical Council is clearly putting a lot of time into making sure that this works for women in Ireland.<\/p><p> The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has laid out various issues as well.  The question I have for the institute is firstly the same question, namely how confident is it that things are progressing in such a way that this could be operational on the ground, to the standards required by January, which is the current goal.  Second, specifically on the infrastructure required in hospital or community settings, the institute has made the point that additional diagnostics are required such as ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, MRI.  Does it have a sense yet of what we are talking about?  Is it five new MRI scanners and doubling ultrasound capacity for example?  I ask the institute and the ICGP what other capacity constraints are out there.  Diagnostics have been mentioned.  When this is up and running, do the witnesses foresee capacity constraints in terms of not having enough GPs?  As we all know, GPs are under huge pressure at the moment.  Do the witnesses foresee not having enough consultants, obstetricians, operating theatres, acute beds or post termination supports for the women?  Could they talk about where the State needs to be quickly investing resources to make sure that there are not bottlenecks through all of this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#H01700","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones because it interferes with the recording of the proceedings.

The first one he raised was the question of the timeline and we were all aware that the Minister has it in mind that the service would commence in the beginning of January.  There are three work streams involved in this process.  There is the legislation, which will be the responsibility of the Oireachtas.  There are the structural implications, that is to say the provision of services either within secondary care or within primary care and the pathways that have been spoken about, where a woman needs a particular course of action to be taken - will that be there for that woman in an expeditious way?  All of that needs to be worked out and to date we are not that far advanced in that side of things.  On the ICGP, our role in this will involve the production of guidelines and the education of our members and we have done considerable work on our guidelines to date but they will intersect with the legislation and with the structural arrangements that will be put in place.  In order for us to finalise that we need to have some knowledge of what else is happening in the three work streams.<\/p> <p>  Education will be another part.  This is a new service being introduced which we have not had in Ireland before.  We said in our statement that people will be unfamiliar and will need guidelines and educational input to reinforce that.  We will probably do that in a web-based fashion but we also have an infrastructure of study groups around the country.  Our continuing medical education, CME, group infrastructure which the committee might be aware of, where GPs gather together and discuss issues will probably be used.  We will also probably be looking to roll out more regional presentations as well so all of this will be a rolling process.  Whether we will have enough time for all of this between now and January is the question.  I do not really have the answer to that because I do not know how far advanced people will be in the provision of the infrastructure and I do not know how far advanced the D&aacute;il will be with regard to the legislation itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Specifically on that point, while I understand that the legislation and structures are the responsibility of other people, is it Dr. O'Brien's view that GPs will be ready to provide terminations and play their role in this system by January?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#J00600","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>On that, it relates to the Deputy's capacity question.

The Deputy will be aware that 60% of practices are now closed to new patients.  He will also be aware that there is a demographic cliff in general practice in that the National Doctors Training and Planning, NDTP, which is the HSE unit for planning, estimates that we will be down 700 GPs in seven years so there are major problems.  GPs will also be looking quite critically at what the Deputy spoke about in terms of the infrastructure that surrounds them and the care pathways that will flow from general practice because they do not want to be in a position where they have embarked on a process with a woman and that they are not carrying that to an expeditious completion because of bottlenecks in the system, waiting times for ultrasound or waiting times for consultant provision.  All the while the clock is ticking and there is the question of who would be legally responsible if the woman's pregnancy goes beyond 12 weeks and she is no longer eligible.

That needs to happen soon so that we can get a clear picture of what the requirements are in infrastructural deficits that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  On the MRI, in reality it is only used in cases of foetal abnormality in order to clarify what the diagnosis is so it is only relevant in those particular circumstances.  An MRI is not needed in every hospital.  There is only one in a maternity unit at the moment, in the National Maternity Hospital but that is the consequence of a very generous grant from an individual.<\/p> <p>  Other scans or MRIs are done in Temple Street Children's University Hospital but that machine has effectively reached the end of its life and needs to be replaced.<\/p><p>There are challenges in that respect.  The MRI machine in the National Maternity Hospital, with some jiggling around, could possibly be a national centre for referral to clarify the diagnosis for women and pregnancies where there are foetal abnormalities.  The consequences of getting it wrong are serious.  We could end up with a termination done for a condition that is not fatal or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It is not an issue at the moment because women have to travel abroad and in many circumstances, or most, when they go abroad, they will have an MRI before having a termination of pregnancy.  That is something that has not been relevant in this country and it will not be until legislation is introduced and practice is changed.  That would require some investment but it is not madly expensive.  It just requires a jiggling around of consultant sessions, etc.<br\/><br\/>On ultrasound, there clearly are capacity constraints and we are all aware of those so that needs to be addressed.

We may well struggle to complete guidelines by January because most clinical guidelines can take longer than that.  Implementation is a much larger process and, as Dr. Boylan said, up to now much work has been done in silos.  Many stakeholders and I feel we would be better off sitting down together and contributing on the implementation process.  From speaking to clinicians on the ground, different hospitals may have different capacity constraints.  In particular, we are trying to anticipate what surgical capacity will be required in hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The narrative in the media up to now has been about the provision of services for the medical termination of pregnancy.  A large proportion, however, certainly between nine and 12 weeks, may well be surgical.  People may choose to have a surgical termination and there are also family reasons why they might do so, such as if they had children at home or workplace issues, etc.  We need, therefore, to anticipate the provision of services in our hospitals.  There is good evidence that provision of surgical terminations needs to be integrated into women's healthcare in hospitals.  We are not looking for separate buildings or separate capacity but we have to be creative in looking at our current deficits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>On the capacity issue, is the institute aware of the HSE, the Department or any other bodies doing a mapping exercise to identify where the constraint issues are hospital by hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#K00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>We have had two meetings with the Department of Health.

My first question is that 1 January is going to come quickly and the witnesses have all rehearsed some of the difficulties.  We know that there are three pillars - legislation, guidelines and infrastructure and resources.  Have all of the relevant stakeholders been in the same room together at any point to have that important conversation or are we only at the stage of drafting up the plan for where we might all get into a room together?  On the roll-out of services for primary care, we hear much about that and that the preference is for primary and community care.  Are we talking about family planning clinics, Well Woman centres and integrating all of the services that exist or is it only just GPs who have been involved in this up to this date?  In respect of the 24-hour helpline, information line or whatever, have the witnesses given any consideration to who might staff that, who they would work for and how that would work?  My sense is that could end up as a crisis line.  A non-clinical person or a non-trained person could not be on that line because the purpose is to direct women towards a clinical pathway.<\/p> <p>  The ICGP made reference in its submission to specialist support that might be necessary.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of that?  We are talking about 1 January and we need to understand if that is realistic.  We do not need to say in the middle of December that we mentioned specialist support and here is the list of what that looks like.  This question is most likely for the IOG but perhaps others might have a view as well.<\/p><p>I am a bit mystified about where the three-day waiting period came from.  It did not form a large part of our discussions at the eighth amendment committee.  I understand it is the practice in some jurisdictions.  I am interested in the views of all of the witnesses as to whether it is wholly necessary and, if it is deemed to be necessary, and we must be guided by clinicians on this, can the waiting period count from the first contact with the helpline or information line?  Do the witnesses envisage that it would work like that?  I will put my cards on the table and state I am not convinced that a three-day waiting period is necessary but it has been flagged.<\/p><p> My final question relates to the duty to transfer a patient where there is a conscientious objection.  My understanding from the presentations is that such a duty to transfer exists already.  I am interested if there are any plans to change that.

It seems to be the international experience that people do their thinking before making the contact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The duty of transfers is current Medical Council guidelines.

Today has helped to bring together the various components that must be put in place.  It is a jigsaw that must be put together by January and then monitored continuously.  We can all see that is going to be quite difficult but it must be done.<\/p> <p>  The presentations were very well put together on what needs to happen in the pre-nine weeks, nine to 12 weeks and post-12 weeks cases.  While we can see the care pathways, there are issues in respect of interaction between GP services and primary care services and even geographical coverage, in south Kerry or north Donegal, for example.  Issues will arise there.  How can we ensure that provisional pathways are put in place to ensure that all those points are covered?  What analysis is being done between the groups represented here working with the Department?  I will return to those two meetings or non-meetings.  What analysis is being done on this?  No one can tell me that we have universal coverage or that there will be a universal coverage map based on the pathways as outlined.  When I look around the country, I know that they do not exist and this will be even more the case in this regard.  What work is being done?  If no work has been done on it yet, the witnesses should be upfront and say so, because then we have a serious issue because we will have to solve it in the next 12 weeks.  There is an interconnection between GPs, primary care setting and hospital settings and there are gaps there.  How will we address that?  <\/p> <p>  My second question is connected to that and relates to the meetings with the Department.  I do not think that a lot happened at those meetings by the sounds of things.  I do not want to put Dr. Murphy on the spot but the Department of Health needs to drive this but, with the best will in the world, it does not come across to me that it is doing so.<\/p><p>I do not want to overlap with the issues that have been outlined by previous speakers.  Where are those issues in the discussions that have taken place?  Where is the issue I have just raised?  Is a plan being put in place?  Have the witnesses seen evidence that a plan is being put in place?  Maybe they can elaborate on what was discussed at the two meetings.  How much progress has been made on foot of those meetings?<\/p><p> In moving on to my third question, I will not ask about the three-week rule and the infrastructure in hospitals.  I respect what everyone has said about the Medical Council guidelines.  In some scenarios, GPs deliberately act in a manner that does not involve referring people on, or camouflages the way in which that happens.  We all know about the issues with clinicians that have arisen recently and have been considered by Dr. Scally.  We will talk about them in the D&aacute;il later.  How are we going to make sure such issues do not happen?  Where they do happen, how can we ensure they can be dealt with quickly?  The issue of geographical coverage arises again in this context.  When doctors behave in a certain manner, how can we deal with that clinically and quickly?  That is my third question.<\/p><p> The fourth question I would like to raise is a quick one.  I presume the witnesses support the concept of a 24-hour helpline.  Various underlying supports, including infrastructure, are needed to kick that off while we do not know what coverage we have.<\/p><p> My fifth question relates to the role of public provision versus private provision.  Concerns jump out to me regarding the latter.  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on private provision?  I have not fully worked out my thoughts on it.  It seems that where there is private provision, there are concerns in respect of aftercare.  There are also concerns about knowledge that is not being garnered or put into the public setting, and the gaps of information because of that.  I suppose it is possible that some individuals will be targeted if they are just in a private setting.  I have asked five questions, some of which overlap.  I do not mind who answers them as long as they are answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#L01700","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I will answer the Deputy's question about how we propose to address potential gaps in the nine-week provision.  Our members have expressed concern in their online feedback about how this service will be provided in remote areas with small numbers of GPs who are under pressure and who are not taking new patients.  We have not been in a position to do a mapping exercise on the numbers because we do not know what we are mapping against in terms of the legislation or the guidelines.  Some innovative suggestions have been made.  There is good international evidence that this problem can be solved in various ways, for example involving mobile provision.  A service run by a family planning clinic or another GP could be provided in a local area once a month, for example.  These are just suggestions.  Someone who rings a helpline could be sent to a provider in another area.  A person in a small town should be able to find a provider without having to run the gauntlet of trying to find somebody.  One of the main ways of addressing this issue will have to involve the Department of Health giving a commitment to a timeline that creates an expectation relating to when care will be delivered.  Women who have tried without success to access the service will have to be able to ring the helpline and ask for help in accessing it.  We do not have answers because the process is just starting.  There is a great deal of international evidence for ways of deal with this issue.  Countries like Australia and Canada have expertise of service provision in remote areas.

There is a duty on objecting physicians to ensure continuity of care, but some of them are falling short of that standard.  As the<i>ex post facto<\/i>regulator in this area, the Medical Council is responsible for dealing with complaints that are made to it and for taking action when it becomes aware of cases in which people are falling short of the prevailing standards.  The Act provides for the confidential process that must be followed when a complaint is made.  It sets out a comprehensive procedure that must take place, and there has to be a full investigation.  All procedural norms must be recognised.  Due process and the constitutional rights of the practitioner have to be preserved.  There must be a full process.  The Medical Council is responsible for making a determination in the context of all the evidence that is presented.  Each case is judged on its merits.  As the regulator, we are in a difficult position.  We do not want to prejudge any particular case.  Every doctor is entitled to a full process and to an open procedure.  The guidelines for conscientious objection and open disclosure specify that there is a strong duty to ensure continuity of care, to act in the best interests of patients and to provide full disclosure.  If, having considered all the standards, we believe someone is falling short, the Medical Council can impose a list of sanctions, including advice, admonishment and censure and, in more severe cases, suspension and erasure, which means the doctor no longer has the right to practice.  This is the role of the Medical Council as the <i>ex post facto<\/i>regulator.  Ultimately, we have it within our jurisdiction, following full procedures and after confirmation by the High Court, to strike a doctor off the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Kelly's third question, which related to the Medical Council guidelines, and his fourth question.

Abortion provision, especially between nine and 12 weeks, is not a highly technical procedure, even in cases of surgical abortion.  It is important that such cases do not necessarily have to go to the largest hospital in the area.  It should be acknowledged that all hospitals can play their part.  There will be some training.

We have listened to our colleagues and we have close connections with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, in England.  Their experience is much greater than ours and because of a difficulty providing the service in the public setting, outsourcing to private providers took place.  Subsequent difficulties arose with a lack of training in the public setting and with variation in standards so we do not want to go down that route.  Also, international evidence shows that data and monitoring are very important.  If the service is spread between private and public, it will not lead to an improvement in standards.  We envisage rolling out a service and there may be changes in how that is delivered over three or five years, as more information is obtained.  It is much better if the service is integrated.<\/p><p> The other important area is targeting of abortion providers if they are in silo settings.

Senator Dolan started from the very important premise of trusting women.  As general practitioners, patient-centred care and keeping women and anybody who can become pregnant at the heart of that care are about trusting the patient and, in this scenario, trusting women.  Starting from a premise of patient-centred care, we are left with trying to support women who face crisis and unwanted pregnancies no matter what decision they may make.<\/p> <p>  From a conscientious commitment point of view, that language has come into the literature to recognise that there is a moral judgment involved in the imperative to provide care in these scenarios when women face these crises.  A significant majority of Irish people voted to change the legislation in the referendum and general practitioners and doctors are no different from the general population.  If anything, they have a more informed position because they see women in these unwanted pregnancies and the extraordinary lengths they have gone to in order to raise money and leave the country.  It was because it was unsafe that the position was changed and the Irish people voted for that change.<\/p> <p>  There has been a serious chilling effect in medicine because we have not been able to talk about abortion and it has been actively discouraged and criminalised.  For those reasons, we have found it difficult to have these conversations.  They are only starting and all of us are on a journey in the sense of clarifying and setting our values.  We have a deadline of 1 January but it will take some time in Irish society, particularly in the medical fraternity, to explore these issues further.

This is also related to what he said about the distribution of the availability of general practice.  As he will be aware, in rural lists the HSE is finding it very difficult to find any doctor to take up the GMS lists.  The Senator is right that the distribution of doctors is more favourable in wealthier areas than in poorer areas and that is a very large problem.  We are currently dealing with a specific area, namely, abortion, but general practice is comprehensive.  It deals with all people and all problems so anything that is causing a failure of general practice will impinge on any discussion, including this one.<\/p><p>Currently, as a country we spend a little bit less than 4% of the national health spend on general practice, which is about half of what the UK provides, and we expect it to be the same.  In terms of numbers of GPs per head of population, we have about half of what Australia and Canada have.  They would be two popular destinations for GPs who are emigrating.  While I am on that subject, we have research with regard to what is happening with our trained GPs, and it now appears that 20% of the GPs who are trained here go away and stay away.  We spend a great deal as a country training those GPs and they are leaving for reasons including lifestyle, career progression and the capacity to do what they are trained to do.<\/p><p> I know members are sick of people coming in to say they do not have enough money, and to be honest, I am sick of saying it, but I still draw their attention to the base rate figures which are what percentage of the health spend goes on general practice and what they expect as a result of that.  It is impinging upon the new service but it will impinge on every discussion.  I have been before the committee for discussions on mental health and it impinges on it in exactly the same way.  It is disappointing from our perspective because we feel passionately about the value the general practice provides to people in local communities and day-to-day lives.<\/p><p> To return to the Senator's original question on how it is going to impact and if we have a plan B, I think it is going to impact on the new service.  I cannot quantify the impact but, inevitably, what is going on in general practice has to have an impact on the delivery and roll-out of the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Is there a plan B?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#O00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I do not know if there is even a plan A.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>With regard to MRI scans, as I explained to Deputy Donnelly, it really relates to foetal abnormalities and making sure the diagnosis is correct.

Is that being considered?<\/p> <p>  The second issue relates to the various units around the country.  One of the issues that will arise is that it is not only a case of there being conscientious objection by doctors but also conscientious objections by nursing staff.  Has there been any discussion individually with maternity units around the country to make sure the services can be provided in each of the units where medical and hospital support is required?<\/p> <p>  The third issue is backup for general practitioners, in terms of whether there is going to be co-ordination of supports for GPs so that if they have an issue on which they need to get advice from a gynaecologist or obstetrician that a structure is in place for that.

There is almost an assumption that these are new women who did not exist before, that the ten or 12 each day who will land out of the sky are additional and have never approached a GPs surgery.  I remember evidence to the committee said that most of the women are already attending their GPs for contraception, cervical smears and so on, so they are pre-existing patients.

I know it is a new service, but these women already exist.<\/p> <p>  There has been comment about the interaction between the GP and secondary care.  However, maternity care is universal in this country.  My understanding is that relationship between the GP and the secondary care provider is already established.

We should be able to manage it.<\/p> <p>  We discussed the ring-fencing of funding in a maternity strategy where the constant drag of women's health and gynaecological issues are just not a priority and women are expected to get over it and deal with their prolapsed whatever until a time comes when someone deems they can have an operation.  I would be very supportive of this.  It is a very time-sensitive matter.  Going from eight to ten weeks totally changes someone's situation.  Ring-fencing of budgets in contraception and the termination of pregnancy services is essential to ensure that women are not put at any undue risk.  We heard evidence that the longer a pregnancy goes on and the later the termination, the greater the risk of complication.  Doctors for Choice argued it should be as early as possible. <\/p> <p>  I refer to scanning.  People are already taking abortion pills in this country without scanning.  We had evidence of the complications.  Will witnesses clarify if it was 20% of under-nine weeks where there were surgical complications or is it less than that?  Is it not less than that?  Will the witnesses clarify the complication rate for medical terminations under nine weeks.  Do they have the evidence?  How would any form of ultrasound or MRI in a GPs surgery, or whatever, possibly effect that?  My memory of the evidence is that ultrasound intervention before nine weeks is neither here nor there except in the rare cases of ectopic pregnancy.  <\/p> <p>  I refer to an abortion providers network.  There appears to be agreement on the 24 hour helpline, certainly when a service starts, although I imagine that maybe in ten years time we will not need one.  However, I am seriously concerned at the idea of an abortion providers network.  Any list of providers of this service is ripe for targeting.  I know there is a list of pharmacists who provide the morning after pill.  Somehow I am not on it but my husband is and every so often, we receive a letter along with religious paraphernalia.  There are lists of people who provide things that others object to.  Such a list of providers seems to invite trouble.<\/p> <p>  The eighth amendment committee was very conscious of the service not being provided by a private operator in this country, but that it would be provided as part of the public health service on a universal basis.

Can those who have engaged in this already tell us if their informed view is that a lead needs to be appointed in the Department of Health between now and next June, for example, for the roll out period of perhaps two years?  Do we need a designated official?  We have three Ministers of State in the Department of Health.  Do they believe that someone must be appointed to drive this?

What I take this to mean is that with 5,000 people travelling to the UK currently, that works out mathematically as 12 people daily.  That probably underestimates the number of women who are requiring abortion.  My understanding is that it is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000.  In any case, the Deputy's point was that this does not represent an extra burden on practices as these women are already patients of the practice and this service can be fitted in.  The nature of the work that will be involved in this will be time consuming.  It is unlikely that it will fit in to the normal process of a standard GP consultation.<\/p><p>The work is likely to cluster.  It is not likely to be dispersed equally across all GPs.  Some 46% of GPs are female.  I am a male doctor of a certain vintage and when I was a young doctor, I was involved in women's health.  As the years have rolled on, I have seen less of it and almost no women's health issues have come under my remit in recent years.<\/p><p> With regard to the distribution of part-time work, many newer graduates work part-time hours.  This is skewed a bit more towards female GPs who are graduating.  It will not be a question of just 12 a day and it will not be evenly distributed across practices.  As we discussed, there is the matter of provision of GPs.  There are plenty of GPs in more affluent areas of Dublin and fewer GPs in poorer areas.

International evidence suggests that for nine weeks and under, one can expect that approximately 10% of women, one in ten, will need some sort of further support following a medical termination of pregnancy.  That may be purely advice.  This is again where the telephone service comes in.  One might ask if there is too much bleeding and if one should do something, or there might be no bleeding at all and one might ask if that is significant, which it might be, since it might be a failed procedure and further input is needed.  Of that 10%, approximately 10% will need to have further medical input and see a provider, either a doctor or a nurse.  Of those, approximately 10% will need to go into secondary care to have something more done.  That is how it roughly breaks down.  The Deputy is correct that as one progresses through pregnancy, it becomes more common.  Early is always best.  With each week, there is a small percentage rise.  We want to make sure that women are kept at the centre of it and that they get access to a procedure as early as possible, effectively as soon as they make contact, depending on the mandatory waiting period, so that we can keep the complication rate as low as possible.  The further we go, the more the burden on secondary care and requirement of resources for it increases.<\/p> <p>  We generally try to avoid ultrasound scanning in post-termination scenarios in the very first early weeks because one cannot be sure what to do with the results.  Access to it will be critical from a GP point of view where this service applies.  In trying to keep the patient central, GPs would like to see a comprehensive contraception service provided and integrated.  Our best goal is to reduce the rate of crisis pregnancies and we can only do that if we have universal access to contraception, not just universal access to termination of pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Favier"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Are there figures for the number of GPs who advertise and provide specific women's health services and have, in-house, their own ultrasound machines?

I want to bring the conversation back to the women who are travelling, with over 1,000 having had to do that since we voted in May.  We will never know the exact figure but from studies which have been done on telemedicine providers, up to five people a day in Ireland use abortion pills purchased online.  These are the key people that we need to take into account.  I agree and understand that GPs and doctors need training, infrastructure and resources, it is vital that unnecessary elements are not built in that will further delay women and those who are pregnant from getting the healthcare that they should get in this country.  With that in mind, we should start with safety.  Abortion is a very safe procedure as testified to in the evidence we heard in the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  On abortion pills, I have spent much time researching them because I was involved in helping to distribute them at a time when they were illegal.  There are more deaths from wisdom tooth extraction than there are from using the abortion pill.  People may have an impression that abortion is highly dangerous and has many requirements.  It is safer than Viagra.  It is probably safer than antibiotics with regard to reactions because people have reactions to antibiotics.  I make these points because there seems to be a layer of bureaucracy that has been talked about being built in to the provision of abortion.  Adverse outcomes are very rare.  I respect the doctors and the studies that they have done but studies have been done on women in Ireland, who have used an abortion pill purchased online, by Women on Web, which is the biggest provider internationally.<\/p><p>Dr. Abigail Aiken testified that less than 3% required any medical follow-up, and this tended to be either antibiotics or a blood transfusion.  A really extreme adverse outcome was rare.  That was in the case of early use of the abortion pill and is in a study published in <i>The Lancet<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>I was very glad to hear Dr. Favier state early scans in a GP surgery would not be necessary because we can imagine how long that would take.  I have read very recent studies from 2015 and 2016 that show they are not required for early pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>I want to speak about the 24-hour helpline.  I would love 24-hour helplines for many issues.  We do not even have 24-hour helplines for domestic violence because we do not have the money.  Is this also something that is not really necessary?  If the service will be provided, and I completely reject the idea of opting in, it should be a normal part of healthcare.  It should not be abnormal that a doctor opts in.  It goes against the grain of everything people voted for to introduce opting in and making the service abnormal.  People should be able to go to their GP and have a discussion.  This is what everyone spoke about in the referendum campaign.<br\/><br\/>The waiting period is another issue.  I reread the committee report, and I stand to be corrected, but I do not see much, or any, reference to it.  Absolutely, it was referred to during the committee's deliberations but there is no medical need for it.  The doctors have just said this and it is what the WHO told the committee.  We all know it was put in as a sop so Deputies could say there are restrictions on women.  Let us be honest.  The WHO told us it is dangerous because it inhibits access for people who are poor or victims of violence.  A woman with other children would have to go for a second appointment.  It looks like this is what will happen but it is not really required.  One appointment should be enough.  If we build in a waiting period, will a woman have to take the first pill in the doctor's surgery?  This is not necessary.  People are taking it with guidance online and they can take it with guidance from their GP.  It would enforce barriers and would mean the most vulnerable women will have time added on.  It is paternalistic.  We do not have a waiting period for anything else.  We do not have a mandatory waiting period for a vasectomy.  It might be recommended to the person to go away and think about it but it is not written into law.  It would be really dangerous for this to be enshrined in legislation rather than being left up to a doctor to tell someone she needs to think about it.<br\/><br\/>My next question is on health and I ask the doctors before the committee to comment.  There is a difference between what the committee on the eighth amendment recommended and what is in the legislation and I am quite concerned about this.  In the committee's report people were at pains to make sure, based on all of the evidence from doctors themselves, that what health was would not be nailed down in law.  The general recommendation was to include reference to risk to health but what we actually have is reference to serious harm.  There is a difference between these two things.  This is a deviation from what we discussed in the committee and it should be opposed.  There would be no consultation with the pregnant person at the centre of it, which is highly paternalistic.  It is not even mentioned that the view of the pregnant person on what is the risk to her should be a factor in the final decision.  It is completely up to two doctors.  I respect doctors but they are not infallible.  The person should have a say.  If a doctor is in a situation where somebody is outside of the 12 week range we would still have criminalisation.  This can have a chilling effect on doctors, as can reference to serious harm rather than reference to risk to health.  Will the doctors comment on why these different responses are included?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#Q01400","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>With regard to the safety issue, we are not trying to overdo the risks of early medical termination.

My apologies if it was interpreted as us overemphasising certain areas.<\/p> <p>  We see the 24-hour helpline as a signpost for people.  There could be situations where a patient does not want to go to her local hospital or GP.  A helpline may provide advice on other appropriate centres.  There may be many advantages to such a helpline.  We and the other clinical groups felt it might be helpful.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's points on the waiting period are well taken.  As far as I understand, it will lead to an extra visit and that could be difficult, particularly for someone travelling from one area to another, perhaps to another community practice.  It would be a particular difficulty for somebody on the margins of the 12 week limit.  If someone at 11 weeks and three days needed to wait three days that would be obstruction, and there is international evidence to state it forms obstruction.  I will mention New Zealand, which has a waiting period and a very liberal interpretation of conscientious objection.  This has led to weeks of waiting for women and we should try not to go in that direction.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the change from \"risk to health\" to \"serious harm\", the Deputy has highlighted that issues in medicine are not black and white.  Certainly we have advocated publicly on the need for the patient's voice to be heard in complex medical decisions regarding her health and pregnancy.  Good practice would involve a multidisciplinary team meeting the two practitioners but good practice would also take into account the woman's experience, her social circumstances and her other children.  We do not legislate for this but certainly it would be good practice.  We already do this in other areas of maternal medicine.<\/p> <p>  With regard to criminalisation, it is something that has been advocated against worldwide.  This year, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists came out strongly against criminalisation of practitioners, particularly those acting in good faith for women.  It is an issue that should be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I can only endorse what Dr. Murphy has said, particularly with regard to involving women in decisions about their own healthcare and discussing with them their interpretation of what a risk is to them, because everybody's circumstances are different.

It is challenging for the women who are taking the pill today, as Deputies Coppinger and O'Connell have described.  It is estimated that 1,000 women will be travelling to the UK, which has been going on for years.  We waited 35 years for what happened yesterday; the timeline is certainly challenging but some 66.4% voted for change.

That is a planning issue to do with the HSE and the Department of Health.  It will also be important that this is sufficiently resourced; ring-fencing of the resources has been mentioned already.  There is also a whole question around capacity and actually providing the people, equipment, buildings and beds to deliver this service both in primary care and within the hospital system itself.

In Holland, where they do have a mandatory waiting time, that waiting time starts from the moment the women picks up the phone.  It would give great reassurance to us as potential providers to know that the Department has our back and that there will be provision within a certain timeframe.  It is not for us to suggest what that timeframe would be but this is a particularly timebound issue, unique in medicine.  As the Senator said, the clock starts to tick for women, but unfortunately it is going to start to tick for providers, too.

I heard the presentations but not most of the discussion.  Returning to the issue of the three days, I note from the presentations that there is nearly full agreement that this should be fundamentally a community-based service, that the vast majority of abortions are likely to be medical, that the abortion pill will be administered in over 70% of cases and that therefore it makes sense for it to be community based.  However, if we take my community as an example, there is a very nice, modern health centre in Ballyfermot with several GP practices but it is very difficult to get an appointment.  It is a very busy area.  The last time I looked for an appointment, I was waiting for over a week to see a doctor even though I did not mind which doctor I saw.  That is kind of typical and therefore I think we have a genuine problem in terms of what GPs can provide.<\/p> <p>  On the whole business of the waiting time, I am very pleased to note all the witnesses agree that it removes power from the woman, is demeaning and can be an obstruction to receiving an abortion.  It is also a real problem to have that timing in there given the pressure on GP clinics I have just described.  Even the waiting time was counted from the day the woman picks up the phone, it could be still five or seven days before she gets the appointment.  I reiterate that it is a big part of it.<\/p> <p>  This is also linked with a question I have about the definition of \"medical practitioner\".  If anybody has already asked this, I apologise for repeating it.  The World Health Organisation safe abortion guidelines say that a medical practitioner is defined as a properly trained healthcare provider, including mid-level non-physician providers.  Would the witnesses see that there should be an important role here for midwives, practicing nurses and indeed counsellors in the health service to help provide the service?  If we are to go forward from January or whenever we can get this service in - sooner if possible - and if we are to rely totally on GPs when there is a crisis concerning the accessibility of GPs as it is, would it not make more sense for the Medical Council and everybody to recognise that nurses and midwives based in clinics could also provide the service, at least up to the point of providing the pill?<\/p> <p>  Taking in my second question on conscientious objection, along with the crisis in GP availability is the fact that some doctors may have a conscientious objection, which will add an extra burden onto the provision of the service.  There is a real, important role for us to be very clear in the legislation on the question of conscientious objection.<\/p><p>There must be an imperative on doctors to refer onwards if they are going to deny women the abortion service.  This must also be policed in order that we can see how conscientious objection is being applied and guarantee that the abortion service is provided.  I would like the witnesses to comment on these points.<\/p><p> There has been considerable discussion on the issue of decriminalisation.  Does the committee intend to examine it or would it be more appropriately sent on to the justice committee?  If a 14-year sentence has a chill factor for medical practitioners, then it is unnecessary and unduly heavy-handed and should be removed.  The issue should be examined in more detail by this or the justice committee.  Will the Chairman explain how that can be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#S01300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>We covered the question of the waiting period.

I welcome our guests.  I have four, or maybe five, questions for them.<\/p> <p>  Form the discussions that have taken place between the professional groups, the Department of Health and the HSE, has agreement been reached, and is everyone in accord, on the concept of doing everything possible to meet the January deadline?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Favier correctly referred to the suite of ancillary or supportive services, including family planning and sex education in schools, which was not mentioned, that would provide information to men and women, boys and girls, in such a way as to improve their knowledge of the situation as life opens up before them, for example, how to deal with the kinds of situation that can arise in emergencies and their respective responsibilities in that regard.  How have these issues been examined in the professional exchanges since the referendum?<\/p> <p>  I do not agree with the now-emerging notion that a three-day waiting period is not necessary.  It was discussed at great length during the committee's hearings.  Reference has been made to other jurisdictions in which three-day or four-day waiting periods are applied.  A good number of European countries are counted.  In some cases, the Netherlands and Germany have longer waiting periods than is envisaged here.  Importantly, the committee discussed this matter at great length.  We agreed or disagreed, but we proceeded on that basis and the referendum followed.  According to the submission made by the medical professionals from the Netherlands, the women involved sometimes changed their minds, as was their right.  That right should be accommodated and I stand over that statement.  If there is a compelling reason for a woman or girl to seek a termination, she has a right to have counselling and some time.  That time should not be of such an extent to endanger her life or whatever the case may be, only to allow her to make a decision based on the best evidence available and what action is most appropriate for her in her particular circumstances.<\/p><p>That is why we come back to the GPs as the first point of counselling.  The GP must be in a position to advise a pregnant woman in such circumstances on what is best for her.  It is not within our remit to change what we have done because the people made the decision on the basis of the Citizens' Assembly hearings, the hearings in this committee room and the submissions made by various people in different, and in some cases appalling, circumstances.  It is important to try to remember that.  <\/p><p> Based on the discussions between professional groups and the HSE and the Minister, are the witnesses all of one opinion on the feasibility of putting together the package of services deemed to be required?<\/p><p> I accept the right to conscientious objections.  Based on the witnesses' discussions with their own professional groups and also with the HSE and the Department of Health, do they believe the services will have the ability to provide a universal service reasonably evenly across the country without areas that will require no services or sparse services?  Will the same constitutional benefits extend to all people throughout the country no matter where they live, without exception?<\/p><p> My last question is on the medical and surgical issue.  The most important thing is to address the health and safety issue, to make the service available and to make sure it is of the highest quality in order that nothing prevents a woman who may have a crisis pregnancy, whatever the case may be, from gaining access to the clinical advice and services required to address the issues she may have at any particular time.  For instance, I can see the three-day waiting period readily being accommodated within the system as it stands if there is a will to do so.  It is important that nothing shall impede the availability of the kind of service that a particular pregnant woman needs at a particular time.  I emphasise that because in the past there have been instances where in the aftermath people have said if something else had been done earlier, there might have been a different outcome.  We need to get away from that.  It is long since passed the time when women will allow a situation to prevail whereby anything less than the best and highest quality first response is available to them at all times.  That is what they spoke about and that is what the people who voted in the referendum spoke about and voted on.  We have to stick to it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#T01600","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I will answer some of those questions.  With regard to whether we are in agreement on the January timeline, we are in agreement that it is a tight timeline.  We are in agreement that lots of different measures need to be taken before then and a lot of integration needs to be done.  We do not say it is impossible but that it will be difficult.  That needs to be acknowledged and a great deal of work needs to be done between now and then to get a service up and running.  The only thing the IOG has been tasked with so far is the development of guidelines.  There is much more to do on the development of guidelines.  We can say what doses of medication are required at a different gestation point but there are many other pieces of the mix that need to be put in place and that requires talking to all stakeholders.  The committee is hearing that message today.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the three-day wait, it is ultimately a legislative issue.  Our point is not to put additional barriers in front of women and to acknowledge that internationally only 10% of women who are offered counselling go for it.  Most have done a lot of decision-making before making first contact.  We must be conscious of the time it could take if there is a three-day wait and an additional visit.  Ultimately, it is a legislative issue.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the feasibility issue, similar to the January timeline issue, we are not all of the same opinion.  There are conflicting opinions even among our members and among various GPs.  Within the ICGP, there is lots of discussion still being had.  We are not all of the same opinion on every issue.  There are some issues we are still considering and on which we need consultation with other medical practitioners, for example, regarding the administration of anti-D to rhesus negative women and whether it would be given at eight weeks or only over nine weeks.  Issues such as that on their own still require consultation.  If we add up all the issues in a complex roll-out, there is lots to be discussed in various fora.  We totally concur with the Deputy's remarks on accessibility and with other speakers that women have to be the focus of this and not necessarily the practitioners.  We must all be focused as multidisciplinary teams on dealing with the development of the best services for women.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan asked if we had reached agreement with all the stakeholders.

I do not think any of my questions have been dealt with at any stage during the hearings this morning.<\/p> <p>  Much was said about conscientious objection this morning.  I would be grateful for some assistance.  When we talk about what healthcare professionals may or may not be required to do, are we talking about criminal sanctions that might face people as a result of how they exercise their conscientious objection?  Are we talking about potential civil sanctions or litigation or are we talking about professional regulatory sanctions, employment consequences or protecting people from employment consequences?  I would be grateful if that issue could be teased out.  Are there examples of general practitioners, whether for conscience or capacity reasons - by conscience reasons, I mean anything such as religious or philosophical objection or their best judgment about authentic healthcare -  who do not offer particular elective medical services but do not have a duty to transfer?  I do not say that everything hinges on the answer to that question but I would like to know the answer to it.  This is an unique issue, a life and death issue.  This is an issue where there is a serious difference of opinion between healthcare professionals who regard abortion as a part of healthcare or alternatively as a human right versus a group of people who in good faith believe this is an unethical, harmful and possibly doubly harmful elective procedure.  Are there existing examples of cases where people do not have a duty to transfer, notwithstanding that they are not offering elective medical services?  Is there a difference in the view of the expert witnesses in the protection that should be afforded to nurses, midwives, other healthcare staff or professionals, including administrative staff, and people involved in teaching medical procedures compared with the protection afforded to doctors, who may have a conscientious objection?  Do they stand in the same relation?  Ought they stand in the same relation?  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the question of the three-day waiting period, to be frank I note the ICGP and IOG representatives are clearly dumping on the idea of a three-day waiting period, yet they are telling us that not all of the people they represent are of the same opinion on issues relating to this.  To what extent have the bodies consulted with members about the three-day waiting period?  What is the state of opinion among the ordinary membership of their respective bodies and can the witnesses enlighten us as to the statistics on how people think about this issue?  It is noticeable how sharply opposed to the three-day waiting period both bodies have been, yet they say at a different moment in the presentation that people have widely varying views.  When the witnesses say that it is not \"necessary\" - this is a word that was used - may I ask what they mean about it not being necessary?  Is there evidence that it facilitates some women in not choosing abortion in some cases?  I have heard it suggested it does not often happen but can the witnesses be more precise in their information?  Why is that condition provided in the Netherlands and in other places?  Are they saying that it is their view that the same number of abortions will take regardless of whether there is a three-day waiting period?<\/p> <p>  In saying that the IOG and ICGP representatives have a clear opposition to it, I have not heard, and perhaps I should have been listening more carefully, what the Medical Council has to say on that, if anything.  On the one hand, the Medical Council is saying that in its forthcoming guidelines, the doctor's view will be backgrounded and the patient's view will be to the foreground.  Mr. Prasifka, on the other hand, draws a distinction between what the law might permit and what the Medical Council considers to be ethical at the same time.  Is it conceivable that the Medical Council might take a view that there is an ethical dimension to the three-day waiting period?<\/p><p>Is it conceivable, for example, that even if the law does not effectively treat the unborn child as a patient where abortion is sought, the Medical Council might say that ethics require consideration of the unborn child as a patient be given?  Might that touch on decisions, reviews or recommendations of the council in respect of the three-day period?<\/p><p> Does a waiting period ever apply in the provision of other kinds of elective medical services?  Again, I am not saying the question of whether there ought to be one here hinges on the answer to that.  Is it the case that with most serious medical services, it simply does not happen on demand and on the day anyway?  The example was raised of a vasectomy.  I do not know how that works.  Is it rare for anything serious to happen on the spot or are there are examples of where waiting periods apply and are effectively prescribed, either by law or by regulation, such that people may not have immediate access to certain elective medical procedures?  Is it the view of our guests that the removal of a three-day waiting period could, or would, cause an influx of women from Northern Ireland seeking abortions in our jurisdiction?  Is it something any of the witnesses have discussed, or have there been submissions to that effect?<\/p><p> I will move to the third phase of my questions.  There has been much talk this morning about preventing crisis pregnancies but no talk about preventing abortion when crisis pregnancy arises.  I ask why that is the case.  I accept the Constitution no longer protects the lives of unborn children as a fundamental right, but it gives full power to the Oireachtas to regulate this area in whatever way we, as legislators, see fit, including, I presume, that we might choose to encourage women not to choose abortion as a matter of good public policy, public health, ethics and welfare of the unborn child and so on.  Why is there no talk of trying to prevent abortion in the context of a crisis pregnancy having arisen?  I presume a three-day waiting period is partly about that with respect to the welfare of the mother and the unborn baby.  I also presume it is one way of trying to keep the unborn child in focus as a patient deserving care, notwithstanding that abortion is permitted.  Is that the understanding of the witnesses as to why a three-day waiting period is in play?<\/p><p> Are there other examples of how the Legislature might keep the welfare of the unborn child in view in the context of an abortion regime applying?  Has any thought been given to how a woman requesting abortion might be engaged with?  I stress this should happen respectfully and never with deception or coercion?  For example, could there be a requirement for a woman to be offered an ultrasound and sight of the ultrasound to strike a balance?  Has that been discussed within the organisations represented here?<\/p><p> Dr. Peter Boylan has said the number of abortions here is likely to mirror that of Scotland due to our similar populations.  There were 12,100 abortions in Scotland last year.  Accepting it is difficult to quantify the number of abortions taking place while also accepting that the best information we have from British and international statistics indicates a much lower figure, do the witnesses accept we are looking at a significant increase in our current rate of abortion on the balance of probabilities?  In light of Dr. Boylan's expectation of 10% of cases resulting in admission, is it reasonable to speculate that we are talking about 1,200 additional hospital admissions in a year?  Given that we have an admissions crisis in hospitals with trolley numbers recently hitting an all-time high, is it reasonable to speculate how the system will cope with this?<\/p><p> It was mentioned that once abortion is introduced, rates fall over time.  I am open to correction but I understand that Scotland's rate has been increasing over the past three years, even as its birth rate has fallen steadily over the past ten years.  In a sense, that lends some kind of urgency to my question about the impact on the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#V02200","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>There are ten questions to be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#W00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I will take the conscientious objection issue.  The Medical Council was established very much to protect the interests of the public in its interaction with registered medical practitioners.  That is what I mean by the patient's voice coming first and the doctor's voice second.  The current provision as regards conscientious objection in the ethical guide covers all lawful treatments in this State and it is not specific to abortion provision.  It covers any treatment that a doctor holds ethical or moral concerns about and does not want to be involved with providing.  For example, this might include any services relating to reproduction such as vasectomy, which was raised earlier.  It also includes assisted reproduction and other lawful treatments.  It is not anticipated that this will change and it is important that it remains in the ethical guide to cover a multitude of treatments available in the country.  If there is an issue with how the conscientious objection is being delivered or interpreted by individual practitioners and that concern comes before the Medical Council, it will be managed in the usual way that any complaint is managed in front of the council.

The Senator mentioned the three-day waiting period but it is not fair to say we are advocating the dumping of the three-day period and we are sharply opposed to it.  We are saying that we do not have evidence to support it, which is quite separate.  Of course, the guideline we produce will be evidence-based and that is where we will go.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked what doctors want.  This is not about what doctors want but about what patients need.  It is important that it is framed in that way.  He asked if we consulted members, specifically those who hold opposing views and views of conscientious objection with regard to the provision of abortion services.  We have done so and an extensive process is under way currently.  It is a qualitative process and we have created an outline document for our members.  We have invited their contributions online and we are still in the process of doing that.  We are not at the end of the process and it will be the end of the week before it is finalised.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about waiting periods for other issues.  In general practice, I cannot think of another instance.<\/p> <p>  He asked about an influx of women from Northern Ireland and it is not unreasonable to expect, certainly in Border counties, that some women would avail of the services.  I do not know how Brexit will affect all of this or where any of that might go.<\/p><p> The Senator asked most specifically about the prevention of abortion when the woman presents.  That kind of goes back a little bit to Deputy Durkan's comment that the GP would advise what was the best thing for her.  I have never advised anyone what is the best thing for them.  I have entered into a dialogue with them as to what might be.  I might present them with evidence, one way or another, but I have wanted it to be something that they owned so that it was their decision-making more than my decision-making.  In terms of the prevention of abortion, it is more a question of allowing the woman to articulate what it is that has led her to the predicament that she is in and maybe explore with her what are her options in the face of that.

Anyone who pays attention to the committee proceedings knows which members only attend meetings of the committee at which women's healthcare is discussed.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the provision of services for women from the North was raised.  As the witnesses are aware, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, announced that such services will be available.  My question is a fairly simple one and relates to two areas.  The meetings which it is thought have been taking place were discussed.  It would be of concern if they have not been taking place.  At such meetings, have the witnesses discussed the provision of services to make good on that commitment given by the Minister for Health and also, possibly, the Taoiseach?  Has the provision of services for women from the North been discussed?  Brexit was mentioned.

Dr. Boylan and Dr. Murphy made reference to discussions that took place with their counterparts in Scotland.  I presume that when the witnesses went to Scotland their counterparts had access to information and could give the witnesses the profile of women accessing services there, which they can track over time.  Very little data will be collected under the current proposals.  What is the view of the witnesses on how we should go about the collection of data and whether we should try to gather more information?  Such data might inform considerations of the care and services that will be needed in the future and whether there may be a need for improved access to contraception or other services in certain areas.  The current proposals do not seem to prioritise the collection of such data.  I believe it important that they be collected.  I ask the witnesses for their views in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#Y01600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Audit is part of running any service.

The World Health Organization, WHO, has very good guidance on what type of data should be collected.  Patient and doctor confidentiality and the new GDPR recommendations must be considered.  For instance, every doctor's Medical Council number must currently be attached under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.

We are pleased to provide this opening statement in response to the committee&rsquo;s request to consider the matter of the authorisation of medicines for the termination of pregnancy, in light of the impending introduction of abortion services in Ireland.  The HPRA, as the competent authority for the authorisation of health products in Ireland, seeks to fully inform the committee in this regard by providing the following information.<\/p> <p>  We will briefly outline the medicines for medical termination of pregnancy and the system for the authorisation of medicines in Ireland and across the European network, in particular the mutual recognition procedure which is relevant to these medicines.

We will conclude with a description of the exempt medicines scheme, which is relevant to facilitating the availability of a medicine where an authorised equivalent is not available.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, medical termination of pregnancy is achieved by the taking of two medicines, up to 48 hours apart, to induce a miscarriage.  The use of these medicines, in combination, results in a safer and more effective procedure.

It can also be used to soften and open the entrance or the cervix to the womb or uterus.  The second medicine, misoprostol, a prostaglandin, causes contraction of the womb and also softens the cervix.  Gemeprost, an alternative prostaglandin, may be used instead of misoprostol.<\/p> <p>  At present in Ireland, there are no medicines authorised for the termination of pregnancy.  Medicines for this medical indication are authorised in many European Union member states.  It should be noted that, across the EU, only a small number of companies are involved in the supply of these medicines.  <\/p> <p>  Apart from exceptional circumstances, to which I will refer later, under European and Irish law, medicines must be authorised before being marketed in a member state.  This is to ensure they meet the required standards, and patients have access to information on the safe and appropriate use of medicines.<\/p> <p>  A medicine is authorised by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, for sale and supply to the Irish market, following a detailed technical assessment of an application for a marketing authorisation.  This application is submitted by a company seeking to market a medicine in Ireland, in the form of a dossier which contains data to support the medicine&rsquo;s quality, safety and efficacy.  If, following assessment, the benefit-risk of the medicine is positive, a marketing authorisation is granted.  The company is then termed the marketing authorisation holder.<\/p> <p>  Medicines used in the termination of pregnancy are currently authorised in other European member states under a scheme of mutual recognition.  Under this scheme, a single EU member state is designated as the reference member state.  The reference member state is the EU-based competent authority which was responsible for assessment of the original application dossier and the ongoing co-ordination of dossier updates on behalf of other named EU countries, known as concerned member states.<\/p> <p>  EU law requires that where a medicine is authorised in another member state, a mutual recognition procedure must be used. Therefore, in order to market a medicine in Ireland for this indication, a marketing authorisation holder must apply to the reference member state to extend the authorisation to the Irish market and, simultaneously, submit an application dossier to the HPRA to<\/p> <p>allow the national phase of this process to occur.  This procedure is required to be completed within a maximum of 90 days of the HPRA&rsquo;s validation of the company&rsquo;s application dossier.  The HPRA will grant an authorisation, having confirmed the medicine&rsquo;s benefit-to-risk balance based on an abridged review, which acknowledges the authorisation granted by the reference member state.<\/p> <p>  Following the outcome of the referendum relating to the eighth amendment of the Constitution in May 2018, the HPRA sought to identify medicines actively marketed in other EU member states, which were indicated for use in the medical termination of pregnancy, and to inquire of the marketing authorisation holders as to their plans to apply for authorisation to market their medicines in Ireland.  This was with a view to, if possible, ensuring authorised medicines would be available at the time of coming into force of the legislation on medical termination of pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  While the HPRA cannot comment on specific applications for reasons of confidentiality, we can confirm that, to date, we have received applications and these are currently being assessed under 90-day mutual recognition procedures.  If the applications are considered acceptable, marketing authorisations can be issued in late 2018.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that these applications are running in a common procedure with a number of other EU concerned member states, so while we do not foresee significant issues, we would insert this note of caution with respect to the impact of other member states&rsquo; assessment on the timing of any final authorisation in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  If an authorisation is granted for a medicine for the termination of pregnancy, the HPRA has requested that the company would expedite the process for making supplies available in Ireland to facilitate the timely implementation of services.<\/p> <p>  In the event that medicines for the medical termination of pregnancy are not authorised by the end of 2018, there is an exemption in law for the treatment of patients with medical conditions for which an authorised medicine is not available.  This is known as the exempt medicines scheme.  Specifically, an unauthorised medicine is considered exempt from authorisation when it is supplied<\/p> <p>under prescription from a registered doctor for treatment of individual patients in order to fulfil an unmet medical need.<\/p> <p>  The HPRA does not issue approvals for use of exempt medicines.  Wholesalers and manufacturers based in Ireland are required to notify the HPRA when they have sourced exempt medicines for the purposes of supply in Ireland.  The wholesaler or manufacturer is required to have processes in place to capture and record any adverse reaction notified in respect of an exempt medicine and to report this to the HPRA.<\/p> <p>  Over the coming weeks, the HPRA will assess the applications received to date and maintain contact with prospective marketing authorisation holders regarding the supply of their medicines in Ireland.  The HPRA anticipates receipt of further applications in early 2019, and these will also be made through the mutual recognition procedure.<\/p> <p>  The HPRA is aware of the importance of ensuring supply of medicines for the medical termination of pregnancy.  We will continue to work with the Department of Health, relevant stakeholders and companies to put in place the services mandated by the forthcoming legislation.  We will be happy to address any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#DD00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Breslin.

It is our practice to work closely with the Department on the supply of medicines and in preparing for the supply of new medicines.<\/p> <p>  On the Vice Chairman's second question, one of the aspects we review routinely is the safety of medicines prior to their being placed on the Irish market.  As she correctly said, the medicines used in the termination of pregnancy in other EU countries are long authorised and their safety is well established.  It is known, for example, that the common side effects associated with these medicines are symptoms such as cramping, pain, bleeding, nausea and vomiting.  Women can be allergic to these medicines and certain contraindications need to be taken account of.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the process I have described around the authorisation of medicines, the company submits a dossier to us but we then receive an independent report from the reference member state that has authorised this medicine and that has experience of the safe and effective use of that medicine.  We receive that independent assessment, which is part of our review along with the dossier from the company.  We can give comments back on that and the company has an opportunity to respond.

I shall address the clinical issues.  The usual schedule is that the Mifepristone is taken first.  This would be early termination of pregnancy.  Depending on the dose, it is one tablet.  It is usual that Misoprostol is taken second, which is advised by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, within 48 hours.  The Deputy is probably aware that there are different regimens.  Those two products are attractive or useful in the community setting because they are indicative for oral use.  Gemeprost is for vaginal use and is perhaps a less useful product.  If the intention of the system is for this to operate within the community and for women to take the first medicine under the supervision of the medical practitioner and the second medicine at home, it would be more practical that it be an oral medicine.  That is usually the system.  We are aware that Gemeprost is used but according to the information we have to date, it is mainly for hospital-based use, and it may be used for the more complex types of terminations, as were discussed at the earlier session.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there was more than one player in the market.  Three companies supply these medicines throughout the EU and we actively engaging with them.  As I clarified earlier, we must initiate a mutual recognition procedure or be involved in that kind of procedure.  We have engaged with each of these companies requesting them to make applications.  We have also engaged with member states that have authorised those medicines asking them to act as the reference member state.  We are approaching this from two aspects with a view to maximising the opportunity of getting applications here.<\/p> <p>  The pricing is outside the remit of the HPRA.  We have nothing to do with that.  As I said earlier, we have had close contact with primary care reimbursement service and with the Department, and we have mentioned to them the fact that there are three companies marketing these.  There are a limited number of options available but these companies are marketing throughout the EU.<\/p> <p>  On the conditions of use, the product information requires that pregnancy is diagnosed using biological methods such as a urine or blood test to measure HCG or an ultrasound.  The conditions of use do not mandate how a pregnancy is diagnosed, just that pregnancy must be diagnosed prior to the administration of the first medicine.  There are exclusion criteria.  For example, if there was concern about an ectopic pregnancy when the woman presents with pain or bleeding or with a past medical history, it would be taken into account.  If a women has an inter-uterine device, which is a contraceptive device, this is also a contraindication to the use of these medicines.  All of this is part of the routine review.  The rhesus factor is also assessed.  The product information will contain the basic information about the indications, the contraindications to use, the side effects of the treatment and how to use the medicine safely.<\/p><p>Since the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, these medicines for the termination of pregnancy have been imported through the exempt scheme for supply to hospitals only.  Under the Act, they are permitted for medical terminations of pregnancy in certain circumstances but it has to be a hospital-based treatment.  There is an established exempt supply scheme for the companies that manufacture these medicines and that will be helpful moving forward.<\/p><p> Liability is not a matter for us.  We permit the exempt scheme and I will ask my colleague, Mr. Lynch, to give more details on that, but essentially the law states that there must be a medical prescription by a medical practitioner who is registered in Ireland and it must be for a patient under his or her care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018091900002#EE00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>It is correct that within the European medicines directive, which has been transposed, that the use of exempt or unauthorised products must be to meet the special needs of patients under the direct responsibility of a medical practitioner.

I am very pleased to be here with my team.  On my right is Ms Carol Baxter and on my left is Ms Sarah Kavanagh.  I am also joined by Mr. John Garry and Ms Caroline Spring.  I am pleased to be here to participate in the pre-legislative consideration of the general scheme of the thirty-eighth amendment of the Constitution Bill.  As the Chairman is aware, I had hoped that we would have been able to hold a referendum this year on what is a fundamental matter of women's equality, namely women's rights to participate equally with men in the public sphere.  I felt all along that this was a really important opportunity and a really good way to commemorate the centenary of women having the right to vote.  I hoped we could remove the final obstacle in our Constitution that suggests the place of women is rightly in the private sphere.  However, I deferred of course to the committee's decision to have hearings on the Government's proposal and other matters.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity therefore to address the committee.  I am here as Minister for Justice and Equality but I also have the experience of being a member of the Constitutional Convention that examined Article 41.2 and made proposals in that regard as the process has informed my approach along with much else.<\/p><p> On 5 July the Government decided that its approach to the referendum question would be to ask the people whether Article 41.2 should be deleted from the Constitution.  It developed its approach to the referendum on the basis of very careful and detailed consideration of the issue.  The referendum in question was discussed twice by the Cabinet and previously by Cabinet committee B.  The Government decided on the option to recommend deletion of Article 41.2 for sound reasons.  First, the issue at the heart of Article 41.2 is one of gender equality, namely whether or not our Constitution states or implies that women have the same rights and freedoms as men in our society.  I regret that the focus on women's equality was lost almost from the start, particularly in an era where there seems to be such public appetite for engagement on issues that affect women.  In this regard, from a legal perspective I was heavily influenced by the lessons of the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  I will come back to that issue shortly.  Gender equality is an important issue.  That aspect appeared to be pushed aside almost immediately by an alternative consideration and concentration on the matter of care, caring and carers.  Of course the issue of caring is really important but the fact that many commentators did not consider it sufficiently important to have a debate on an issue of women's equality is somewhat telling to me.  It suggests that women's issues remain of secondary importance.  There is still some reluctance to afford gender equality the importance it deserves in our public discourse.  That is not the message that we should be conveying to young women and girls in our society.  The future of our society rests on their capabilities as much as it does on young men.<\/p><p> Second, to conflate an issue of women's equality with that of caring bears out something of a stereotype that a woman's role is primarily that of carer, so it was precisely to remove this stereotype once and for all that the Government wished to ask the people whether Article 41.2 should be deleted from our Bunreacht.  Many carers are women but many carers are men so caring is not primarily a gender equality issue.<\/p><p> Third, our strong legal advice was that deleting Article 41.2 carried the fewest risks.  The experience with the eighth amendment is fresh in our minds.  The mess, heartache and societal division created by the eighth amendment remind us how difficult it is to draft constitutional amendments that will stand the test of time.  The Constitution is not a proxy Government nor indeed is it a piece of legislation - it is our foundational legal framework.  It does not work if we insert overly prescriptive provisions in our constitutions.  These may either become outdated quickly or fail to address the range of needs they were intended to address.  Furthermore, the courts may interpret the provisions differently over time than was anticipated.  Again we have experience of that over the years.  The High Court's decision in the case taken by my ministerial colleague, Deputy Zappone against the Revenue Commissioners, seeking recognition of her marriage shows that we cannot always predict with certainty how the courts will interpret our Constitution.  It was that ruling that ultimately necessitated the marriage equality referendum.  I am aware that some people are of the view that the Supreme Court will interpret the Constitution in a way that accords with the aspirations of those people.  Many eminent lawyers point out that the Supreme Court's approach is that constitutional interpretation can evolve over time and can never be predicted with certainty.  It favours the simple deletion of Article 41.2, believing that complex policy matters should be tackled by Government, the Oireachtas and this committee.  Policy is best dealt with by the elected representatives of the people, rather than set in the rigidity of our Constitution.<\/p><p> I am conscious that the Constitutional Convention and the taskforce chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality recommend that Article 41.2 be removed from the Constitution and be replaced with provisions enshrining rights for carers.  I myself was a member of that convention and had some reservations about the depth of analysis regarding some of the recommendations.  However, the convention made its recommendations and these were the starting point for the work of an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality.  That committee examined the convention's recommendations as well as those of the subsequent taskforce.  As I have said, the convention did not examine this issue in great detail.  It was when we began to test each of the options proposed that the complexities of effective constitutional change really became apparent.<\/p><p>I fully recognise the vital contribution made by parents and carers day after day, hour after hour and I meet, and seek to help, many carers in my capacity as a Deputy, as does everybody around this table in their capacity as public representatives.  I recognise that caring work can be arduous and unrelenting and that the negative impact on many carers can be profound.  However, it does not necessarily follow that enshrining a provision in the Constitution is necessarily the most effective way to advance and protect the rights of carers.  I have discussed this issue at length with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, who of course, has policy responsibilities in this area.<\/p><p> Carers are highly diverse.  They may include parents, children, grandparents, grandchildren, siblings, relatives, friends, neighbours, professional carers, childminders, nurses, social workers and doctors.  Some are undertaking caring work on a full-time basis and others are not.  Some perform a caring role on a part-time or intermittent basis.  Some undertake the caring role themselves.  Others pay professional carers to preform specific tasks.  Some are paid for their work and others are unpaid.  The type of constitutional provision that would capture the diversity of carers and of care situations is a real challenge.<\/p><p> Following prolonged discussions, it became abundantly clear to the Government that the issue of care warrants separate and distinct consideration in its own right.  For this reason, the Government decided that this issue should be referred to a citizens' assembly.  We first have to understand precisely what carers need before we jump to the conclusion that the Constitution is the best and most appropriate route.  My colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is best placed to speak to the committee in detail about the State's support for carers.  The combined expenditure on carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance and carer's support grant in 2018 will be &euro;1.15 billion.  The Government introduced two weeks of paternity leave in 2016 and is currently considering the option of introducing paid parental leave for parents.  Government policy supports care.  We have not needed a specific constitutional provision to allocate this level of spending to care-related needs.  Equally, in view of the complexity of care needs and situations, it is clear that legislation agreed by these Houses would be, perhaps, the most appropriate route to deal with this matter.<\/p><p> The interdepartmental committee tasked with recommending specific options for this referendum considered the possibility of modifying Article 41.2 to make it gender neutral so that the contribution of fathers as well as mothers would be recognised.  However, the difficulty was that non-marital families would have been excluded.  The committee will be aware that 38% of children were born into non-marital families in 2017.  When the Government examined this issue, we decided against a proposal which would exclude the contribution of unmarried mothers and fathers.<\/p><p> Some people have proposed other options, for example, inserting a new provision on caring into Article 45.  We also sought extensive legal advice on this proposal.  However, the advice stood that the lessons of the two previous referenda suggested that it was not good practice to insert new language into the Constitution.  Moreover, an addition to Article 45 would be of questionable value given the non-justiciable nature of the article.  Our experience with the eighth amendment reminds us that constitutional change is highly complex and the implications over time unpredictable.  Our approach has been to propose a clear question to the people of Ireland.  In this way, the people can be clear as to the likely implications of their decision.  The Government believes that we owe it to the women of Ireland to propose that the referendum should focus on the issue of gender equality and on removing a provision that seeks to define women's place as solely being in the home carrying out duties.  It was my hope that this referendum would facilitate and encourage real civic engagement with the important issue of gender equality and the work that remains to be done to remove the structural and cultural barriers that continue to discriminate against women in this country.  As Minister, this was my starting point.  While the Government is working to advance gender equality, I would like greater engagement by all sectors of society on this important issue.  <\/p><p> As we move into the second century of female suffrage, our Constitution, which does not seek to define the place of men should not seek to define the place of women on the basis that a woman's place is where she wants it to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#G00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I echo the Chairman's remarks.  I have an open mind in respect of this issue, although I have an inclination towards deletion.  Everyone agrees that the provision is inappropriate, outdated and sexist and that it needs to change.  There is no dispute about that in this room.  The issue is whether the provision should be changed through amendment or deleted.  I note the Minister's point about gender equality.  It is extremely important but I would not like the message to go out, or people to think that, the Constitution does not value, protect and apply gender equality.  The provision in Article 40.1, which has been interpreted many times by the courts, is meaningful and guarantees equality based on gender.  It is important that people do not get the impression that the Constitution does not protect gender equality; it does.  Many cases have been heard by the courts in which they have recognised that Article 40.1 is a guarantee of gender equality.  However, I note the point the Minister makes in respect of this anachronistic provision.<\/p> <p>  The task force, in option 1, put forward a wording which would not create a new right that could be interpreted by the courts but which would still give symbolic non-gender based recognition to the work that is done within the home with the State recognising that home and family life gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.  What was the Minister's reason for rejecting this proposal and deciding to go along with the deletion proposal?  He mentioned that he believes it is a safer option.  The wording set out in option 1 does not open up the possibility that the courts could determine that the people have created a new constitutional right giving rise to financial support to be paid by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#K00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the work of the task force.

It has been referred to in cases but it does not constitute an enforceable constitutional right for women or men who believe they are being discriminated against because their work in the home is not being recognised.<\/p><p> With regard to the wording in the taskforce's first option, I do not see any basis upon which a court would turn around and say that the people have voted to give a new constitutional right and it simply converts Article 41.2 wording from a gender-specific terminology to a gender-neutral terminology.  My own view is towards deletion but I can understand why people may think we should give and maintain some symbolic recognition for work done within the home and for family life.

I would not like to see the creation of a new constitutional right forcing an obligation on the State to make payments.

It should be viewed in the overall context of a social welfare budget.  I agree with the Minister that I would not like to see any new constitutional right created.  The matter should be dealt with in the Oireachtas.  However, we should not be too negative about symbolism in the Constitution.  Sometimes symbolism is important in politics.  As of yet I have not heard a very strong reason as to why an amended symbolic clause could not be inserted into the Constitution.  Fearfulness of doing it because the courts may interpret it in a different way is an overblown reason, particularly if we are just going to amend the Constitution in accordance with the first option outlined by the task force.<\/p> <p>  These are my general views and I have an open mind on it.

I read everybody else's but we did not get the Minister's speech before the meeting started at 9 a.m.  I have had to make notes, which puts us at a bit of a disadvantage.  It struck me while listening to the Minister that there seemed to be a contradiction in some of the comments.  On the one hand he made the point strongly that this should be excluded entirely and it was an issue of gender equality, so we should not conflate it with caring as that in itself was patronising to women.  He argued that this implies that women are just carers and that although they are not the sole carers, women do the bulk of the work.  He argued that we would be defining it in that sense so it should not be in the Constitution.  However, he then said he would look at a body that could discuss the matter later if we took out the article now.  Perhaps I did not hear that correctly.<\/p><p>The Minister seemed to be saying on the one hand, repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>now but on the other, that he would set up something else to look at caring.  His justification for the repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>now argument was that he did not think caring should be in the Constitution.  That is what I heard although I may be wrong and would like to hear more on that.<br\/><br\/>I am struck by how every organisation and body that examined this issue prior to now recommended replacement.  I do not think we should be wasting time here.  Everybody knows it is sexist and outdated and that it is going to go.  The question is whether it just goes or whether we put something else in.  I am not sure what the problem is because the point the Minister makes about the courts having to interpret the matter applies to everything.  We might as well not have a Constitution then or else we should abolish the courts and the Oireachtas can just legislate for everything.  We have a separation of powers here and it generally works.  The courts generally get it right.  I do not see how that argument really stacks up.  I have an open mind and while symbolism is important, I would like to see something that is more than just symbolic.  Unlike Deputy O'Callaghan, I do not have a problem with that.  The right to free education, for example, is the same type of thing, as far as I am concerned.  Does it mean that everybody gets free education?No, not as such.  Does it mean that everybody gets their education of choice?  No, but the provision does enable some people to access educational supports that they would not get otherwise.  The volume of unpaid labour and the economic value of that labour to the State by those who work in the home and as carers should be recognised.  If there is an economic cost, I do not have a problem with that in the Constitution.  I invite the Minister to comment on that.  I have an open mind although I am erring on the side of replacement because I would like to see something in the Constitution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#L00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I acknowledge what Deputy Clare Daly has said.

The Deputy takes the view that there should be something in the Constitution and makes a very fair point in that regard but the difficulty arises when we ask what that might be.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the Citizens' Assembly, it was felt that we should have an assembly on the issue of caring but that assembly may not come back with a constitutional provision.  It may make recommendations to the Government or the Oireachtas of a totally different nature.  I certainly would not like to pre-empt what it might do but I expect that its deliberations will be much broader and will not be merely framed in the context of the Constitution.  I do not see the perceived contradiction in what I said in terms of simple deletion and the work of the Citizens' Assembly.  <\/p> <p>  Caring is very complex and if clauses on caring are to be entered in our Constitution, that will require really careful consideration.  Indeed, that informed the thinking of the Government on going through the various options in considerable detail.  On the matter of the family, references to the family in the current Constitution are really limited and relate only to the marital family.  They do not relate to wider family configurations.  Many caring relationships between siblings, for example, would not be covered in any event.  I want to impress on the committee that these issues were given the most detailed consideration.  These are issues that go back to the early 1990s in terms of an approach that Government might take on what might be put to the people.

I will listen to the arguments in favour of a simple deletion and the legal implications of same but it is perfectly reasonable for this committee to engage with this properly and to listen to all of the arguments being made on the issue.  I take on board the point made with regard to the eighth amendment but a lot of it comes down to the wording that is selected.  Indeed, at the time many in the legal profession argued that the provision that was put forward was, in itself, something of a contradiction and was deeply flawed from a legal point of view.  It is a question of how right or wrong we get it, technically and with a good wording that has been given proper consideration and is legally tight, there is no reason to be fearful of unintended consequences.  It is just a matter of doing the job correctly and scrutinising any proposal that is made.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to see a new provision inserted that recognises the value of care and is gender neutral.  There is a role for some element of symbolism in the Constitution but having said that, while there are many positive elements in the Constitution, we have been too reluctant to consider positive social and economic rights.  In fact, the one strong positive social and economic right in the Constitution has served us well.  The right to primary education has been applied judiciously and with care by the courts.<\/p><p>There has been a reasonable and sensible application of that provision.  It has meant that parents and families have been able to assert their children's rights to education.  I am thinking particularly of cases that were taken in respect of special education in the 1990s and 2000s.  I think there is a role for that.  I am open to considering whether there is value in a new constitutional provision.  We will consider the various proposals that are advanced.  I think I understand the arguments that are being made in favour of a simple deletion.  I think this issue is worthy of our full consideration.  I look forward to hearing some of the more specific proposals that might be made by certain organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#N00600","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Of course I welcome the views of Deputies and Senators.

After legal advice was received, it was clear that each alternative wording carried difficulties of unintended consequences and different interpretations.  It seemed quite clear to me that deletion represented the pathway forward with the fewest risks.  That is why the Government introduced a proposal to that effect.

I do not have a position on this question.  That is why we are here.  We want to listen to what everyone has to say.  I hope that we will learn more about this matter and that we will be more informed when the time comes to make a call.  I find it amusing that the Minister waxed lyrical in his opening remarks about women's rights and equality in the workplace, given that his Government has done bugger all about the cost of childcare, which is probably the biggest barrier of all.  Ireland currently has the second highest childcare costs in the OECD.  According to an ESRI report that was published earlier this month, \"childcare costs act as more of a barrier to employment for households with lower income\" and \"exclusion from the labour market due to childcare costs will increase poverty risks and household joblessness\".  Recent Governments have actively eroded the rights of mothers who do not work full-time by taking away the child tax credit through tax individualisation and by cutting their pension rights.<\/p> <p>  If the Government were interested in making actual strides in the direction of gender equality, it would introduce legislation on maternity, paternity and family leave, it would invest in publicly subsidised childcare that is affordable and of an appropriate quality, it would provide recognition for care through a universal pension scheme system and it would reform the childcare sector in order that childcare workers are paid more fairly.  Ireland currently spends less on pre-primary education - 0.1% of GDP - than any other EU country.  If we simply delete Article 41.2 from the Constitution, there will be no provision in the Constitution for the role played by carers in the home.  According to Family Carers Ireland, it is estimated that family carers save the State &euro;10 billion a year.  According to Ms Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland, the simple deletion of this wording would carry with it a danger that many people would feel that recognition of their value was also being deleted.  If the Minister and his Government colleagues are so concerned about gender equality and equality for women in the workplace, why have they pursued policies since 2011 that have done the opposite, as far as I can see?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#O00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I do not accept that.

I put it to the Deputy that we have a strong record in responding to the childcare needs of parents.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, received substantial increases in funding in budgets 2017 and 2018.  When I served as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I worked on the development of initiatives like the early years strategy and the single affordable childcare scheme.  The overarching and fundamental point I would like to make about the referendum in my capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality is that this is a gender equality issue rather than a money issue, a finance issue, an education issue or a childcare issue.  I would like to reinforce one particular point by impressing again on the members of the committee that an amendment would have application to a marital family only, due to the article in the Constitution that refers to such a family only.

I am accompanied by my fellow commissioners, Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally and Mr. Frank Conaty.  We welcome the opportunity to share the views of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on this important matter.<\/p> <p>  The commission is Ireland&rsquo;s national human rights institution and equality body.  It was established in 2014 with full institutional independence and a range of statutory powers for which we account directly to the Oireachtas.  A further aspect of the commission&rsquo;s statutory duty is to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality and to make recommendations on measures to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights and equality in the State.  <\/p> <p>  It is in this context that the commission prepared its paper on Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in June this year, which has been circulated to committee members.  We had a formal meeting with both the Ministers for Justice and Equality and  Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 2 July.  The Ministers were presented with this paper in advance of that meeting.  <\/p> <p>  The question of advancing gender equality in the State has been a particular focus of the commission since our establishment in 2014.  The commission has repeatedly raised concerns that in its current format, Article 41.2 perpetuates stereotypical attitudes towards women and their role in society and embeds a value system in our constitutional framework that serves to undermine gender equality.  This is no surprise to this committee.  In the context of the meeting with the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it was made clear by the commission that it did not support the Government's current approach to the constitutional change. <\/p> <p>  The  commission is also of the view that Article 41.2 is not compatible with Ireland&rsquo;s international human rights obligations.  There have been repeated calls by United Nations, UN, treaty monitoring bodies for Ireland to remove or amend the provision, most recently by the UN committee on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, which last year urged Ireland to remove the stereotypical language on the role of women in the home from the Constitution. <\/p> <p>  In approaching how we may address the gender stereotyping currently enshrined in the Constitution, it is important to bear in mind that this debate is not taking place in isolation.  It is part of a critical consideration of how the State defines, recognises and supports the term used in Article 41.2, which is \"the public good\".  This includes the debate about the protection of economic, social and cultural rights, including in the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the meeting with the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the issue of a deliberative process was discussed, with the commission open to the idea of a deliberative process to consider more broadly the debate that needs to be had.  <\/p> <p>  Article 41.2 is at the heart of this discussion of public good.  It has at its core, a recognition of what former Chief Justice, Ms Justice Denham, called an immense benefit for society, that is work in the home, or what we may wish today to more widely understand as care work both in the home and beyond.  The article&rsquo;s assumptions of who carries out this work and where, and what this work entails, may be outmoded but at its heart is a clear recognition of that public good.  The commission, therefore, believes that amending Article 41.2 to render it gender neutral and wider in scope rather than deleting it is a means towards preserving and expanding that important recognition of an important public good in our fundamental law.  That is the first recommendation.  <\/p> <p>  A crucial feature of Article 41.2 is its placement within the rubric of the constitutional protection of the family.  In line with aiming for gender neutrality, the commission broadly supports recommendations to replace references to women and mothers with references to \"family life\".<\/p><p>However, the commission is of the view that in choosing such wording, regard must be had to the wide range of family relationships that are recognised in the State&rsquo;s developing law and social policy, as well as in the context of international human rights law.<\/p><p> A wider conception of family life encompasses a wider range of caring relationships than parenting alone, including beyond the family home.  The commission believes it is possible, and desirable, to amend Article 41.2 to recognise and support care work within this wider understanding of family life.  Ireland is in the process of transformation.  Our population is ageing, our families are smaller and they often come in diverse forms.  In many ways, our current national conversation is seeking to understand how we can ensure our fundamental law catches up, in order to be more reflective of our society.  The commission believes that an opportunity exists to approach reform of Article 41.2 both as an exercise in removing an archaic reference and as a means of introducing a compassionate, generous recognition of the public good realised within Ireland&rsquo;s diverse families and in caring roles.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee again for the invitation to appear today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I will introduce Ms Orla O'Connor and I thank the committee for inviting the National Women's Council of Ireland to speak about the referendum on Article 41.2, commonly referred to as the article on women in the home.<\/p> <p>  The NWCI is the national women&rsquo;s representative organisation, representing more than 190 member organisations across Ireland.

When we ignore their experiences we do so at an enormous cost, to both women and our society.  A successful referendum on Article 41.2 must first be based on a participative and deliberative process for women and men.  If we do not allow enough time for a transparent, participative and respectful process that recognises people&rsquo;s complex identities and feelings, there is a danger of it becoming divisive - divisive between people dedicated to working in the home and those who work inside and outside the home; divisive between those who do unpaid work that contributes to society and those who do paid work; and divisive between families and between women and men who work in the home.<\/p> <p>  A public conversation is necessary in order that the referendum debate can be informed, the issues surrounding the article can be explored and concrete proposals developed which the Government can act on and in regard to which it can be held to account.  We need a clear pathway with real outcomes for women, informed by public discussion.  Recent referendums have offered us a shared path, as citizens, through participation in the debate and through casting our vote.  Through the Constitutional Convention and Citizens' Assembly, we have developed in Ireland sophisticated models of consultation and deliberation where both expert and personal testimony can be heard.  It will be absolutely critical in this public discussion that the experiences of women in all our diversity are heard.<\/p> <p>  Article 41.2, which refers to a woman&rsquo;s life in the home and duties in the home, is undoubtedly sexist and discriminatory.  In practice, the article has been little more than symbolic.  Its placement in the Constitution should have led to a recognition of the value of the contribution women make through unpaid care work in our society.  However, it has faced minimal judicial scrutiny.  It has had little or no impact on the positive formulation of social policy or improving the position of women.  For example, it provided the constitutional and cultural background for the marriage bar and its detrimental impact on women&rsquo;s choices, employment and economic independence, the legacy of which we are still dealing with today.<\/p><p>In practice, Article 41.2 has not supported the home or family; it has merely diminished the position of women.<\/p><p> There have been many deliberations on Article 41.2.  The UN body tasked with examining and upholding women&rsquo;s rights globally, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, has repeatedly criticised Ireland&rsquo;s retention of Article 41.2 in its current form.  It expressed concern at the persistence of traditional stereotypical views of the social roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and in society at large.  CEDAW suggests that the male-oriented language be replaced with gender-sensitive language to convey the concept of gender equality more clearly.<\/p><p> The article has been reviewed extensively in the past, going back to 1996.  All except the Second Commission on the Status of Women in 1993 recommended that the article be amended or replaced to recognise some form of care.  When the members of the 2013 Constitutional Convention, which the National Women's Council of Ireland addressed, voted to express their view 88% said it should not be left as it is and 88% chose to amend or modify it, with only 12% favouring a straight deletion.  The most recent Government task force recommended options for the insertion of language regarding care and recommended an option to place new text in Article 45.<\/p><p> Over the years, the NWCI has consulted widely with our members.  It is clear from all our conversations with our members that everyone is agreed that there is no place for discrimination in our Constitution.  It was opposed in 1937 by women activists and feminists and it has no place in today&rsquo;s Ireland.  In our consultations there was no disagreement regarding the need for the sexist language in Article 41.2 to go.  On this matter, everyone agrees.  However, once we move on from the sexist language and the positioning of women in the home, our discussions around Article 41.2 move quickly to the complex choices and challenges that many of us face every day.  These issues relate to our understanding of family and home, the roles of women and men, economic supports for parents and work-life balance and the contribution of care and carers.<\/p><p> Views expressed by our members on the article also quickly move to the need for adequate provision of supports and time to care and to be cared for, both inside and outside the home.  There is also a very strong argument that those receiving care need to be recognised within that relationship, and valued to the same extent as those providing care.  The discussion on this article is complex and connects to a broad range of issues that need to be considered when proposing a referendum.<\/p><p> The issue of care is central to women&rsquo;s equality and the NWCI recognises the complexity of issues when we discuss the area of care.  In all the discussions on Article 41.2, the NWCI has advocated for the need to recognise and to value care in our society.  Care work is essential to the common good; it performs vital social and economic functions.  Recognition and valuing of affective care is fundamental to full equality for women.  Affective care refers to human dependence and interdependence and the right to give and receive love and care.<\/p><p> One of the key challenges is that while there has been a significant increase in women&rsquo;s participation in the labour market, this has not been balanced by any increase in the contribution of men to domestic or care work.  Nor has there been an adequate State response through recognition of, or investment in, care work.  We are concerned that the current discussion on care and Article 41.2 is being narrowed to a consideration of carers, which is only one aspect of care and affective equality and could lead to what the Taoiseach has referred to as a hierarchy of rights, which is not the intention of NWCI.<\/p><p> The NWCI members are also very conscious of the context of Article 41.2.  Article 41 includes a definition of the family which does not reflect the reality of families in Ireland nor the diversity of family life.  It presumes a male breadwinner and a two-parent household where a woman stays at home and it does not take into account the reality of the many LGBT families and one-parent families.<\/p><p> The NWCI considers that the role of affective care in the achievement of equality should be recognised and supported through a combination of constitutional, legislative and policy change.<\/p><p>We know social change can have complex personal impacts that deserve consideration and respect.  We need time for a public conversation that considers any proposed new wording and any accompanying legislation.  We believe this process needs to begin immediately so we can proceed with holding the referendum in 2019.  We ask the committee to recommend to the Government that a public consultation or conversation is established to consider a combination of constitutional and legislative change options that recognise the importance of care in its full form and that enough time and resources are provided to help the public understand and discuss the proposed changes and their implications.  We ask for this to happen before a referendum is held.  We have not suggested in our submission a particular form for the public consultation but it could be along the lines of how the Citizens' Assembly dealt with the eighth amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il as an gcuireadh a bheith anseo.  It was a very sensible decision to undertake scrutiny and have a considered discussion on this issue before presenting a<i>fait accompli<\/i>to the people.  I have made a longer written submission, which considers the history of the provision, that members may find of use.<br\/><br\/>I will concentrate on the main question for committee members to consider which is, as far as I see it, what the purpose of the provision should be.  The major downfall of the existing provision is that it was never clear whether it was intended to be purely symbolic or whether concrete rights should flow from it.  Because this was never challenged in the courts it has effectively been useless in law.  We are all agreed there is no reasonable argument for keeping the provision.  The gendered and paternalistic language is an obvious problem.  Because of the history of the provision, at this stage it is not very likely it will ever have any effect in law.  It is also an embarrassment in this day and age to have such insulting language in the Constitution.  When international lawyers read our basic law they are always taken aback by this provision.<br\/><br\/>The question is not whether the provision should be repealed, it is whether repeal <i>simpliciter <\/i>or a replacement is more appropriate.  This is where the issue of purpose comes in and I will elaborate on this.  If it is decided to replace the provision rather than simply repeal it, essentially two options are available.  The first option is to insert a replacement provision along the lines suggested by the Department of Justice and Equality's taskforce.  This would include gender neutral language acknowledging the important role played by carers in the home and a sentence to the effect that the State would endeavour to support such persons.  This type of language would not automatically create any socioeconomic rights for carers and would avoid financial consequences for the State.  However, in terms of the purpose of the provision, we would have to decide what the aim of such a replacement would be.  Would it be to include a symbolic reference to carers to acknowledge the role they play in the home, and possibly use the provision as a motivation to encourage the Oireachtas to pass new legislation to create stronger statutory rights?  This would be the effect of such a provision.  A symbolic provision in the Constitution is of limited value since it would not create any concrete constitutional right.  However, some civil society groups have argued that it could be useful, when trying to encourage the Government to pass legislation on certain issues, to be able to point to a constitutional provision as encouragement for the reform, even if is a symbolic provision and the Constitution does not actively demand it.  It may be worth pointing out the existing provision has not been of much use in this regard.<br\/><br\/>If the aim of the provision were to be to have a constitutional symbol that would encourage the creation of legislative rights, perhaps a better location for the provision would be in Article 45, which contains the directive principles of social policy.  These are non-justiciable, which means they cannot be made the subject of a court action and thus rights do not automatically arise from them.  This would make it clear that the aim was symbolic and it would also avoid any question around restrictions regarding the marital family in Article 41.  If the provision is left in Article 41, which is the section on the family, there will always be a question mark over whether a judicial interpretation would be given that would impose an economic obligation on the State.<\/p><p>This is the fear of the Minister.  This is not very likely, given the words \"endeavour to support\" and the fact that carer supports are already provided for, to a certain extent, in legislation but the possibility always remains.<\/p><p> The second option would be to aim to create a constitutional right by replacing the existing provision with a stronger version, which would be gender neutral but which would commit the State to supporting the work of carers in the home in economic terms, thus creating a concrete constitutional right in Article 41.  This could be achieved by wording such as \"the State shall ensure that persons caring for others in the home will be supported\".  It would be unusual to tie the hands of the Government in this way.  According to the normal separation of powers theory, it is the Executive that determines matters of budgetary policy.  As has already been mentioned, we already have one existing socioeconomic right clearly set out in the Constitution, which is the right to free primary education.  This obviously imposes a financial burden on the State.  We have heard many arguments about other socioeconomic rights that could be incorporated into the Constitution.<\/p><p> We must bear in mind that ultimately the people are the true masters of the Constitution and if they were to vote such a provision into the Constitution there could be no issue about its constitutionality despite the fact it would be unusual under the normal separation of powers theory.  Certainly there would be no constitutional bar to creating such an economic right.  It comes down to the issue of purpose.  Do we wish to replace the provision with one that would be more cosmetically attractive and could be used to influence legislation or do we want to go further and replace it with a strong provision to ensure carers are sufficiently supported but would involve a restriction in the budgetary power of the Executive and could have significant financial consequences?<\/p><p> There is always the third option, which has already been proposed by the Government, to remove the provision and not replace it.  This is certainly the easier option as far as the Government is concerned, because while something is in the Constitution there is always the possibility of an unexpected or unintended interpretation by the courts.  The Attorney General and constitutional experts can give opinions but, ultimately, the Constitution means whatever the courts say it means.  Until we have a conclusive opinion from the courts we can never be absolutely certain of the effect that any particular provision will have.  Removing the provision and not replacing it removes the risk that any replacement provision will ever have any unintended legal consequence.  It comes down to whether Members of the Oireachtas want to create a new provision that would have legal consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Cahillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses.

It has been very interesting to listen to the positions and views outlined by the witnesses.  Much of what I have heard has confirmed my reason for supporting the view that the committee and Oireachtas should recommend simple straightforward deletion, which is the complexity of the issue and the fact there are multiple ways in which we could approach this if we do not go for straight deletion.<\/p> <p>  As has been very clearly outlined by Dr. Cahillane in her contribution, we could go with various options but these would create problems.  I am interested to hear from people advocating for something different from my view.  If we opt to replace it with a provision that has no effective obligation but is just a statement we run the risk of alienating a number of people who would like to see something stronger.  If we replace it with something that confers obligations, I will refer to this as the \"shall\" option, we run the same risk in the opposite way.<\/p><p>It is an absolute nightmare to hold a referendum, about which everybody agrees, to remove something which should not be there.  In such cases the referendum gets caught up in the politics of the issue, although we cannot envisage what that will involve at this point, and this can result in the referendum being lost.  That would be regrettable.  We would be going beyond a question of straight deletion and getting involved in myriad other views and opinions.  My view is that it is the role of the Oireachtas to provide the necessary guidance, and to bring forward legislation according to policies decided by a majority of Members.  If they are changed by the public at an election, so be it.  In light of the experience this country has had, I am very cautious about this.  No matter how well thought out it is and no matter how well legally advised we are that it can create a solution to something, it is a very precarious road to go down.  In the case of the eighth amendment, we effectively handed over power to the Judiciary and to its interpretation of the situation.<\/p><p> What do the witnesses think of the argument for replacing the article?

I do not feel that complexity should stop us from doing something now as opposed to down the road.  It will take consideration and consultation but, from the perspective of caring, there is no doubt about the stereotypical language in terms of gender and role.  I believe a lot of people are aware of what caring means and where carers are coming from in this context, but I will dig into it a little bit further.  Caring does not just involve an individual providing care and a person receiving care.  It typically involves a family and encompasses everything to do with the family.<\/p><p>It impacts the entire fabric of family emotionally, physically and economically.  We can put metrics on the contribution carers make, and it is important to do so, but sometimes the contributions onto which we cannot put metrics are even more important.  We need to address two aspects of the role of carers: recognition and support.  Recognition is important because, even if it is symbolic, symbols can be important.  Symbols can also, however, be empty if they are not accompanied by support.  The role of carers in society and their contribution to us as a nation is immense and deserves recognition.  We have an opportunity to do that and even if, being complex, it requires consultation or if there are issues requiring definitions as to boundaries as a result of an economic impact, we nevertheless need to take it seriously.  We need to have the courage to deal with it in that context.<\/p><p> There is no impediment to engaging with this aspect in isolation from the amendment or Article 41.2.  We need to be brave and to amend the article.  We need to look at what family life is within the article as well as the role of carers, parents and other family members and how we support them as they contribute to society.  This also includes siblings, sons, daughters and a wide variety of people who care within a family context.  We should take this opportunity to recognise carers while dealing with the stereotypical language around gender and role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#Z00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Conaty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537344000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>If we separated the two issues and held the referendum first, we would put the cart before the horse.

The Minister referred to legal advice but has refused to publish it.  It is most likely that the Attorney General would have said that one cannot write off a constitutional provision.  It has been useless in law because no rights have ever flowed from it, nor any legislation passed as a result of it.  In the Sinnott case, Mr. Justice Geoghegan said that, in an appropriate situation, a woman could claim a breach of her rights under Article 41.2, which indicates that it is not closed off forever.  A replacement provision could have the same effect, which could be good or bad depending on one's point of view, but we should not be afraid of amending the Constitution simply because we are not quite sure what a court will say in 20, 30 or 50 years' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I do not favour amending the Constitution at all.

This is interesting but I am not being facetious in saying that, having listened to the debate, I am now more convinced of the need for a replacement.  The options presented by Dr. Laura Cahillane are very clear.  We either take out the provision and include one that is symbolic or we put something in that gives more economic and social rights.  I am cognisant that the commission is a statutory body and separate from the others but the support for the starting point of the Constitution being a document for the public good is such that the huge area of work involved deserves a mention.  I will not waffle on about my opinion on the matter because we will definitely not resolve the issue here.  I would like the opinion of the panel on pointing a way forward, which is something we could do.  Do the delegates believe that, in our report, we could recommend, for example, the establishment of a citizens&rsquo; assembly, the sanctioning of finances for it and the setting of a timescale sufficient to enable the process to tie in with the local and European elections?  The decisions on funding would be left to the Oireachtas.  I am curious about this.  Could the witnesses add anything on this?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in Dr. Laura Cahillane's point of view.  She referred, on the one hand, to how it might be better to put the wording into Article 45 and referred, on the other, to how it might not.  Have the witnesses a view regarding the family?  The Minister suggested an argument I had not heard, namely, that if we included \"family life\" it would only cover married family life, be it the married family life of same-sex couples or otherwise.  One would have to be married, however, to enjoy the benefits.  There could be a problem with the idea of \"family life\" in that context.  How would the witnesses get around that?  This matter seems to be key.  Those were my two questions.  I hope I will be able to come back to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#BB00900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>We will open up the debate.

It was also in connection with considering women's participation in life.  Therefore, it was very tight and there was not a lot of room for discussion.  We would like to see a process similar to that on the eighth amendment.  On the question of whether what is desired could be done by May, the timeframe would be tight.  We are conscious of that.  The Minister mentioned the other referendum on divorce.  Maybe it fits with that.  It can be done in 2019; however; we would be clear about that.  We would want it done in that way.<\/p> <p>  We also raised the definition of the \"family\" in the Constitution.  That is why we are open to examining Article 45.

On the point about directive principles the commission is concerned that this would not allow for a strict enough or positive enough obligation on the State to support carers' roles and their work because of the way the directive principles have been interpreted, which is in our view too limiting.<br\/><br\/>With regard to Article 41 and the definition and construction of the family, and the specific role given to the marital family, our longer policy document which was published in June 2018 and which I hope is available to everyone cites Mr. Justice Hogan in the RX case in 2010 in the High Court, who was of the view that the Constitution, and specifically Article 41, was not closed off from providing protection under certain circumstances to other close relatives outside of the specific scope of marriage.  In our policy document and elsewhere we have cited Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the interpretation given there to family life.  We presume that in the Constitution there is compliance with international law unless a clear indication is given otherwise.<br\/><br\/>There is the further question of the whole allocation of resources, socioeconomic rights and separation of powers, which has come up a number of times.  We note that the vindication and protection of civil and political rights is a highly complex matter.  Some examples include the right to a fair trial, access to the courts and administration of justice.  There are differing views on the scope and limits of those rights, and it requires huge allocation of resources on the part of the State to vindicate the right to a fair trial, for example.  The allocation of resources and decisions around that is essentially connected to the protection of any right, whether it is categorised in a traditional way as civil and political or as economic and social.  <br\/><br\/>As already mentioned the right to an education is explicitly recognised in the Constitution but our courts have also recognised other socio-economic rights.  The right to seek employment, for example, was recently recognised for asylum seekers by the Supreme Court in the NHV case, in which the commission was an <i>amicus curiae<\/i>, and in which the Supreme Court cited a general comment of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was a first in the Irish courts.  Economic, social and cultural rights were recognised there as being of progressive implementation but nonetheless positive obligations are imposed on the State.

As Professor Mullally has said, the human rights commission's fear is that it would not provide strong obligations for the State.  The point is that Article 45 is a symbolic provision.  There have been times the courts have used Article 45 to refer to unenumerated rights but generally Article 45 is not something which leads to concrete constitutional rights.  That would be a solution if the committee felt that a symbolic provision was more appropriate and did not want to go forward with a concrete provision which would grant economic rights to carers.<\/p><p> On the marital family issue, it is difficult in that Article 41 has been interpreted by the courts to refer to the marital family.  Where the family is given protection in the Constitution it is only the marital family which is given protection.  The Constitution does not say that but because it gives special protection to marriage it has been interpreted by the courts as meaning that the family has to be a family based on marriage.  There is always room for interpretation there.  One hopes the courts would give an updated meaning to a provision in Article 41 to include families other than marital families, but that definition has been ingrained in the Constitution until now.  It is slightly off point but a much more meaningful amendment to the Constitution would be to amend Article 41 to change that definition in order that a de facto family would be recognised, rather than a marital family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Cahillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I call Deputy O'Callaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#DD00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.

It has been a useful exchange.  It showed why it was important to have this pre-legislative scrutiny.  What Dr. Conaty said earlier struck me in terms of the roles of carers and how we identify carers and what care is.  It takes many different forms and comes in many different guises.  I am similarly of a view that the sexist nature of what has prevailed needs to change.  I am thinking about the symbolic recognition of care and carers and how important that is.<\/p><p>It is complex if we want to do it justice because not only do we have the competing views of women and men and gender neutrality but we also have an increasing number of children and elderly people caring for disabled children or people with specific needs and requirements.  Many carers face feelings of isolation and marginalisation.  Symbolism can address that to some extent but in terms of their daily bread and butter it can be down to the legislative flow that might be required.  What are the arguments relating to access and benefits and how we tangibly support carers?  Children cannot open bank accounts, for example, so it is a complex issue.  I appreciate that I have not formulated all of this in my head.  It is something separate that struck me from the conversation and questions thus far.  <\/p><p> I will try to put it into the form of a question.  Are the witnesses aware of any other examples of good practice internationally where states have included the symbolic nature of care and a constitutional recognition of care?  Care does not always prevail within the family.  We probably all know of instances of community care where neighbours look after more vulnerable people within their community.  That constitutional recognition of solidarity and support and care is important.

It provides a starting point to expand it and remove the discriminatory element.  It would allow us to ground what is behind that, which is to recognise the value of care and caring work in the context of family life.  That is what we are trying to build on and, in doing that, we would draw on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Our recent ratification of the CRPD gives another context to that as well.  They are the kinds of international human rights obligations and obligations with regard to social security and caring more broadly that can ground it.  The specific details are a matter for the Legislature, as is currently the case regarding payments around disability support, support for childcare and the work of carers.

It is not a question of guarding against legal tests.  Why not put that to the test?  That would be my view.

Any rights vindication issue, such as the right to a fair trial, requires the State and the Legislature to engage in difficult decisions on resource allocations.  Any question on rights, whether we categorise them in a rather traditional way as civil and political or socio-economic, requires an allocation on the part of the State and decisions about resources.  The adjudication by courts will also inevitably lead to those consequences.  We need a framework within which those decisions are made to effectively vindicate that right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018091900002#MM00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speech","time":1537344000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I have one question.

We are proposing recognition of care in a gender-neutral frame, which recognises that it is important for men and women, for all people in society.
