I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make a brief statement.<\/p> <p>  Although this is a relatively short Bill, it addresses some important matters.  The principal issues dealt with by this legislation relate to overseas operations as well as the provisions in the Defence Act for the enlistment of minors.  In addition, the opportunity has been taken to make a number of other minor amendments to the Defence Act.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, I will be moving an amendment to delete section 4 of the Bill as this particular amendment to the Defence Act was accelerated and enacted pursuant to the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  I also take the opportunity to advise the committee that I propose to bring forward a series of amendments at Report Stage to allow for a member of the Reserve Defence Force, on a voluntary basis, to provide additional support to the Permanent Defence Forces at home and overseas.<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government, within the framework of the proposed commission on the Defence Forces, includes a commitment to carry out a review of the role of the Reserve Defence Force, including the question of deploying members of the Reserve Defence Force with specialist skills on overseas missions.  Having considered the matter, I recently obtained approval from Government to bring forward amendments to the Defence Acts to provide the legislative basis, by way of enabling provisions, to allow members of the Reserve Defence Force to serve in support of the Permanent Defence Forces at home and overseas, on a voluntary basis.   These amendments do not, in any way, preclude the commission from examining comprehensively the roles of the Reserve Defence Force nor do they prejudge any possible recommendations from the commission.  I am simply taking the opportunity, through the current legislation, to facilitate any such recommendations by the commission, on a wider role for the Reserve Defence Force, which I believe to be necessary, by removing the current legislative restrictions.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendments will focus on the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 and the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, removing prohibitions, contained within those Acts,  on members of the Reserve Defence Force serving overseas.  There is also an amendment to facilitate a broader degree of support, which the Reserve Defence Force can offer to the Permanent Defence Forces at home.  There will be some consequential, technical amendments required to the Defence Act 1954.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that any deployment of a member of the Reserve Defence Force, on foot of these amendments, will be on an entirely voluntary basis.  Also, I cannot accept Deputy Berry's amendment but we will more than compensate for that by bringing forward a series of other amendments at Report State that are consequential on each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020112600002#A00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1606348800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It was part of the recruitment and retention issues, basically, and it still is.  We are re-enlisting people now.  We have not achieved the numbers we would like but there is a steady stream of people seeking to come back into the Defence Forces, for various reasons.  Some of the reasons are linked to job opportunities that no longer exist due to Covid and others because we have a very active recruitment campaign under way.  It is one of many strategies to deal with the fact that we are 1,000 people below where we should be in terms of the number in our Defence Forces.  One of the ways to address the issue, and arguably it is the most efficient way, is to bring people back in who have left but have the skillset and training so can slot back into the Defence Forces quickly.  That has been a very successful scheme within the Air Corps, particularly in terms of getting pilots back.  We are trying to ensure that for the Army and Naval Service.  There has been legislation done for it so we do not have to do it again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020112600002#A01000","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1606348800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1606348800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1606348800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1606348800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 6, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:  \t<b>&quot;Amendment of section 3 of Defence (Amendment) Act 2006<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>8.<\/b>The Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 is amended in section 3(1) by the substitution of &quot;Defence Forces&quot; for &ldquo;Permanent Defence Force&quot;.&quot;.  <\/blockquote> <p>I am not sure how relevant this proposal is.

We had quite a good debate on this on Second Stage.  The Bill is quite technical.  It does not change fundamental policy on defence, but I was anxious to use this opportunity to put in place legislation as a foundation, from a legal perspective, to allow the commission to make recommendations to the Government on the future of the Reserve in terms of its function.<\/p> <p>  Nobody is questioning the existence of the Reserve, but it is currently way under strength.  Many people have said to me that if the Reserve had an increased role, they would consider joining more seriously.  I hear the kind of accusations of training for training's sake, as opposed to training for the purpose of being deployed with and complementing the Permanent Defence Force at home and abroad.  The decision to join or stay in the Reserve should be informed by a more ambitious approach to its role.  Of course we need to manage that in a responsible way. <\/p> <p>  Many in the Permanent Defence Force will need reassurance that this is not in some way limiting their place on the career ladder or opportunity to serve overseas; quite the opposite.  We have limitations on what we can do overseas because we have shortages of certain specialties.  Ships are not going to sea because of the limitations enforced on us due to the fact we are missing a chef, medic, specialised engineer or whatever.  There is an opportunity for specialist skill sets, in particular, in the Reserve to be able to complement and work with the Permanent Defence Force at home and abroad.<\/p> <p>  When the commission has been established I will ask it to examine this more seriously in terms of international best practice and make some recommendations to me.  I have encouraged it to be ambitious and, if necessary, quite radical to reflect the future security and defence challenges we face.  One of the specific terms of reference will be the Reserve Defence Force.  I do not want the commission to make recommendations and for us then to have to start the legislative process all over again.  It could take six or eight months to facilitate those recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate what Deputy Berry is willing to do.  If he withdraws his amendment, he can resubmit it on Report Stage and see what I come up with.  He could then push or drop it if the amendments I bring forward go as far as he suggested.  As he said, they will probably go well beyond what his amendment proposed.  We are in a good space.  I will share the amendments as soon as they are ready for Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020112600002#B00500","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1606348800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.
