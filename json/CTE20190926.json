He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  <\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.  We will hold the minutes over until next week.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise an item arising from last week's meeting, the seeking of additional information.  We have discussed it, but we will consider the formal minutes next week.  At last week's meeting there was quite a discussion about the correspondence which had been received from the HSE, item No. 2334.  We discussed the breakdown of consultancy costs for the children's hospital group.  Expenditure under the heading of ICT-digital was &euro;3.6 million; expenditure under the heading of clinical operational support was &euro;3.5 million; expenditure on medical equipment was &euro;1.8 million; expenditure on corporate services was &euro;1.6 million; while expenditure under the heading of programme management was &euro;421,000, giving an approximate figure of &euro;11 million.  We said we would seek additional information, but I want us to be more specific about what we are seeking.  I want to write back to the HSE telling it that we want a description of each consultancy project and information on when it started, how much has been expended to date and the estimated total cost of each project.  We saw the payments for consultancy arrangements for one year.  Is it just part of a bigger picture?  We want to have a full picture of each item included in the figure of &euro;11 million.  If it only involves the consultancy aspect, is there a larger project to be delivered at the end of the consulting work and is there an estimate of what it will cost?  The HSE tells us that it is related to the children's hospital group which encompasses Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals and that it is integrating all of the children's hospital networks in Dublin that will form part of the national paediatric programme.  We have discussed the cost of construction at length, but we have always known that several hundred million euro is to be set aside to cover IT, patient and non-construction costs which will be significant.  Nobody had really addressed this issue.  As we have only looked at the increasing cost of construction, we want to know how this aspect fits in.  <\/p> <p>  We want to put the same letter to the Department of Health.  Has it been incurring any expenditure on the project that is not showing through the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board?  In particular, we want to write to Children's Health Ireland, the CEO of which is Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman.  It has been mentioned here before.  Ms Hardiman is probably involved in what we are talking about.  To my knowledge, the group was formally established as a public body on 1 January 2019.  Up until then it was operating under the HSE, but on 1 January a new board was established for Children's Health Ireland.  We want to write to it also.  We want to pull all of the strands of the extra elements together - the Department of Health, the HSE and Children's Health Ireland - in order that we can get a full picture because when the national children's hospital opens, we all want it to function properly from day one.  It is obvious that there will be extra costs.  What is beginning to happen is that there are extra costs.  When we know to ask the right questions, I want to have a comprehensive picture of all of these elements.  I think members understand from where I am coming.  It is that we will know where we are going, rather than have another &euro;100 million pop up about which nobody will have told us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#BBB00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>The Chairman is right to try to get a comprehensive picture.  There is a deeper issue about consultancy costs and fees paid by Departments and State institutions, an issue on which we have focused for some time, but we need to look at it in a more singular way.  We had it with the third level institutions and the Department of Education and Skills.  It seems that some State institutions cannot make a decision without engaging the services of a consultancy firm.  Questions must be asked about the wisdom of doing so given the amounts of money being spent.  If one was to add the amounts of money spent every year by every Department and State institution, be it hospitals, schools, ETBs, institutes or universities, it would come a significant amount.  I imagine the private sector does not work on that basis.  Where is the in-house knowledge?  Much of it amounts to repetition.  It should be best practice.  Consultancy work seems to be done when the same work would have been done on change management in a different organisation.  It is sloppy and a little lazy at times.  It is easy because they are spending taxpayers' money.  I am not saying there is no justification for spending money on consultancy because there is a place for it, but it seems as if significant amounts of money are being spent on pretty much the same work.  Rather than learning lessons, they repeat the same work and hire the same consultancy firms to do it.  Is it something at which the committee could look from a value for money perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#BBB00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>It sounds like the subject of a special report, but we will-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#BBB00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Is there any way we can find out?

I asked what work they had undertaken, and the costs ran into tens of millions of euro.  Some of them are one-off projects and one can understand why they are necessary for speciality services, but there were things like internal audit etc.  I understand there is a shortage of accountants, but this was in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and they were routinely used.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was at a summer school and said it concerned him, and that there was a need to be much more thoughtful about engaging consultants from the point of view of value for money.  We should start with value for money because it has to be questioned whether people are taking a risk-averse approach or whether behaviour needs to change.  There is an issue with building up an institutional memory and institutional capacity with regard to capital projects, where we build up the expertise in the entities in question, meaning we have to engage them repeatedly.  It is almost self-fulfilling that we keep going to these companies.  There is a multiplicity of aspects to this and I will send the Chairman the replies to my parliamentary questions as they suggest an agenda to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#C00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I agree with colleagues.

Correspondence No. 2390 A, dated 20 September 2019, No. 2392 A, dated 24 September 2019, and No. 2408 A from the Data Protection Commission are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Perhaps this is as good a time as any to take two items of correspondence relating to today's meeting from the Data Protection Commission.  They are correspondence No. 2403 B and No. 2404 B.  We have been in contact with the commission about getting the report.  No. 2403 B makes it clear that the commission was concerned about the fact it could not issue the report without the consent of the Department.  It sent the report to the Department and it had implications for it because the Department resisted.  The letter is from Mr. John O'Dwyer, deputy commissioner, Data Protection Commission, who said the Department had already written to the commission to object formally to the publication by the commission of a short summary containing details of the eight findings made in the report, and the steps the commissioner called on the Department to take on foot of those findings.  The Department had asserted that publication of this material without its prior agreement was prejudicial to its interests and, as a matter of law, was not within the commission's power.  The letter from John O'Dwyer said they believed the report should be published by the Department.  On 23 September, we received a further letter from Mr. O'Dwyer confirming the report had been published by the Department.  We will note and publish these items.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence category B is from Accounting Officers and Ministers in follow-up to previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The first is from Mr. John Madigan, head of marketing and research, Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, dated 31 July 2019, providing information requested by the committee regarding the number of jobs supported by the SBCI in Ireland.

When we asked about the employee numbers, it was said to us that employee data are gathered in two ways, depending on the kind of grant or loan the business avails of.  It is said that, by and large, employee data are gathered at the stage when a business is eligible to make an application.  It is just the total number of employees in the organisation that is obtained when an application form is received.<\/p> <p>  Maybe we will hold over the question of whether we want to discuss with the organisation the number of loans it has given and the number of recipient companies.

At the end of June 2019, the figure was 316 cases, with an estimated liability of &euro;67.9 million.  When the witnesses were here, we asked for the breakdown.  The reply we received last week stated the State Claims Agency was collating the information and that when it was available, we would be contacted.  We got information from the agency that we noted at the previous meeting.  It told us separately that Tusla cases on its files point to a figure of &euro;50.76 million.  We are told in the letter it relates to 254 cases.  When the two figures are added together, the agency has, in respect of each of the 254 cases in respect of Tusla, an average provision of &euro;200,000.  With regard to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we are told there are four cases.  The State Claims Agency told us in its meeting last week that the cases managed by it in respect of the Department resulted in a figure of &euro;460,000.  It is providing an estimate of &euro;115,000 for each of the four cases.  Interestingly, the total amount covered is &euro;67.9 million.  When one removes the figures of Tusla and the Department, the balance refers to Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  There are 58 claims in that regard.  There is &euro;16.68 million for claims in respect of the campus currently in the State Claims Agency files.  That gives an average provision of &euro;288,000 in respect of the 58 claims.  I am just putting that on the record because, unless one combines the correspondence of last week and this week, one could not work out the figure.

Is it agreed to hold it over?  Agreed.<\/p><p><b><\/b>No. 2373 is from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dated 5 September 2019 providing information requested by the committee at the meeting on 9 May 2019.  There is some interesting information provided.  We asked why there was an increase in money for Garda masts and the response is that it was a timing issue in that it did not receive payment in one year and it came through the following year.<\/p><p>Members will be interested in the next note, which is an update on the approximately 14,000 people affected by the fixed charge notices to include the number of people who had lost their licences as a result.  Members will recall that an examination of summonses and charges issued between January 2006 and December 2016 identified a significant number of summonses and charges issued for persons who had committed offences, but were brought before the courts incorrectly, which required further examination.  I remind Deputies that this is nearly three years old.  The letter is detailed.  We asked for an update because the fines collected in 12,000 cases had to be repaid.  The note states that it has been difficult to track down all of the people affected and that some of the registered letters sent were returned.  They were then sent to the divisional offices for delivery but when officers tried to deliver them they found the people were no longer at the addresses.  They tried to get their new addresses and are still following up and making inquiries.  Three years on, in the cases of the approximately 12,000 people affected, more than 4,000 letters of consent have been received.  What they are saying is that they want to go back into court to get the case struck out and the points removed but they need the consent of the persons before they bring their names into court.  Of the 12,000 affected, only 4,000 consents have been granted to date.  There are a further 8,000 people who got penalty points.<\/p><p>Maybe some of them feel they have expired and they are not interested.  Let us be clear about that.  They should be able to get to the bottom of it.  They are saying that in the absence of the consent from the individual, they cannot do anything about it.  They are saying that in respect of the driving licences, no response received from a person affected has indicated to the Garda that they had actually lost their driving licence as a result of the extra penalty points shoving them over the figure.  People were on the radio and television stating that was happening.  The Garda states it has no proof that that happened.<\/p><p> It is interesting it is taking so long.  It is not a good administration system where, three years on, they have not been able to tie down two thirds of the people concerned.  It speaks for itself.  I want to be fair to the Garda.  For many people, perhaps the points are now extinguished and they are not bothered with it anymore.<\/p><p> Details are given of the cost of establishing a cybercrime unit, of the internal affairs unit, and of the training costs for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A note is given on prepayments and advance payments of ICT provision.<\/p><p> Details are also given of the collection of insurance premia by the Garda on behalf of insurance companies.  It is stated it is for medical insurance &ndash; we were worried that this related to cars that were found on the road that were not insured and premia were being collected.  It merely seems to be an internal payroll issue.  They seem to get a commission from health insurance companies for processing and collecting the premia.<\/p><p> The status of the canine unit is given.  It is stated that each handler has responsibility for the care and maintenance of his or her training dog.  I had raised this issue that there were nine new ones attached to the dog unit in Kilmainham.  Two of these kennels were erected towards the end of 2018 and a further seven require construction.  A year on, there are only two of the nine done.  Agreement had been reached with Office of Public Works, OPW, to provide the kennels to the remaining seven members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In some cases, they have the dogs in their own back yards at home without proper facilities.  That is not the way.  These are highly specialised, trained dogs that are of considerable assistance in crime detection.  I urge the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to spend the money, do the job, get it over and done with, and look after that area properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#F02200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The number of speeding fines that were not followed up on was announced on the news in recent days.

We will ask for an update on that.  The letter is clear.  We note and publish the letter stating that the commission refers to EU funds for training purposes in the Garda College.  It states there are legacy issues.  There are two different sources.  One relates to the issue and one was raised at the Committee of Public Accounts.  They state the account was maintained in Templemore with the consent of the Department of Justice and Equality but it has nothing to do with the Garda Training College - that is merely where somebody was administering it &ndash; and the bank account was sanctioned by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The last paragraph states that during its investigation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission obtained a significant amount of documentation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and Equality, the financial institution and the European Union itself, and that as this is a criminal investigation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is limited in what information it can release at this time but, as stated above, the investigation is now at an advanced stage.

The matters related to the accounts of Bus &Eacute;ireann, which are not examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is quite a debate here about whether school transport worked on a cost recovery basis.  There was a suggestion that it always did but it became clear recently that Bus &Eacute;ireann had a surplus in that area, which has now been moved back to support school transport in future years.  The essence of this issue was that Mr. Lynch had been involved in several court cases against Bus &Eacute;ireann and the State related to this.  We are going to note and publish this letter since it relates to the audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Mr. Lynch mentions the report and the cost recovery.  He asks if the Comptroller and Auditor General will confirm that cost recovery was not the correct basis, notwithstanding that he has issued the report, and that perhaps a profit was made on it when the Department told us that it believed there was no profit, just cost recovery.

Two sets of accounts were required because the legal structure of the Commission changed as a result of the passing of the Data Protection Commission Act 2018 and the commencement of relevant sections of the Act on 25 May 2018, coinciding with the beginning of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, regime on that day.<\/p> <p>  The format of the accounts is similar for the two periods of account and was previously applied by the former Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The accounts are prepared on a cash basis and transactions are recognised in the period they occur rather in the period to which they relate.  The results for the period of account are presented in a receipts and payments account.  There is no balance sheet, but some accrual information is included in a note to each account.  The commission relies on the Department of Justice and Equality for its payment and accounting system.  As the Chairman mentioned earlier, it is planned that the commission will have its own Vote from 1 January 2020, and from then on the commission will report financially in the appropriation account format.<\/p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s activities in 2018 were funded through Oireachtas grants totalling just over &euro;8 million.  This was applied in paying staff costs totalling &euro;4.9 million; accommodation and equipment costs of &euro;1.1 million; operational costs of &euro;371,000; and legal and professional fees of &euro;1.7 million.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure of the commission has increased in recent years, as the staffing and activity levels have grown.  The increase in expenditure between 2017 and 2018 was around 30%.  Up to 24 May 2018, certain data controllers and data processors were required to register with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and to pay registration fees.  The registration fee receipts were remitted to the Department of Justice and Equality and recognised in the Vote for justice and equality as appropriations in aid.  The registration and fee regime ended with the coming into force of the 2018 Act.  I issued clear audit certificates in respect of both sets of accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and invite Ms Dixon to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#M00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee on the 2018 financial statements of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Data Protection Commission.  As the Chair mentioned, I am joined by a number of my colleagues from the Data Protection Commission.  I am going to refer to the Data Protection Commission as the DPC from now on.  The colleagues I am joined by are deputy commissioners Anna Morgan, John O&rsquo;Dwyer and Graham Doyle and the DPC&rsquo;s professional accountant Graham Geoghegan, who has been a welcome new addition to our team in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The DPC is fully funded by the Exchequer currently through a subhead of Vote 24 of the Department of Justice and Equality.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General just indicated, this latter arrangement will change in 2020 when the commission is to be allocated its own individual Vote.  At that point, I, as currently the sole Commissioner for Data Protection, will become the Accounting Officer in line with section 25 of the 2018 Act.  In this context, the DPC appreciates this early opportunity to engage with the committee as it will provide useful direction in terms of an exploration of the accounts of the DPC, particularly as the budget allocation of the DPC has increased considerably in recent years and as the authority now takes on many additional new and direct responsibilities in the areas of accounting, HR, ICT and procurement.<\/p> <p>  The committee is aware that the DPC is the national independent supervisory authority responsible for monitoring and enforcing the application of EU data protection law.  The GDPR, the e-privacy regulations, the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2018 and the law enforcement directive all provide the main legal frameworks under which the DPC regulates.  There are in the region of 20 other items of legislation under which the DPC must perform particular supervisory functions assigned to it.  The Credit Reporting Act 2013 is one such example.<\/p> <p>  The provision that the data protection authority in each EU member state is independent in the performance of its functions is fundamental to the GDPR.  Article 52 of the GDPR prescribes that each member state shall ensure that the supervisory authority is provided with the human, technical and financial resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of its tasks and the exercise of its powers.  Currently, based on figures produced by the European Data Protection Board, the DPC in 2018 was the eighth largest in the EU in terms of both employee numbers and budget, slotting in behind, for example, the UK with 513 staff and a 2018 budget of over &euro;51 million and France with 199 staff and a budget of over &euro;17 million.<\/p> <p>  The DPC operates in a very specific context at an EU level in that it is the lead supervisory authority in the EU under the GDPR for most of the world&rsquo;s largest technology companies, given their headquarter locations here in Ireland.  This brings considerable additional volumes of work, complexity and scrutiny but also grants the privilege to the DPC of handling cutting-edge cases in this important area of law.<\/p> <p>  It is worth recalling that 2018 was a historic year in terms of data protection.  The 2018 Act was the first comprehensive piece of national data protection legislation enacted in the State since 2003 and it gave further effect to the GDPR in Ireland and transposed the law enforcement directive.<\/p><p>The core functions of the DPC under the GDPR and the 2018 Act include handling complaints from individuals on potential infringements of their data protection rights.  In excess of 4,000 complaints were received in the calendar year 2018, which represented a 56% increase over the figure received in 2017.  A total of 3,366 of those complaints were concluded in 2018.  Some of the complaints are easily resolved with intervention by the Irish DPC.  For example, an organisation might fail to provide an individual with a copy of their personal data, and when the DPC intervenes, the data may be immediately forthcoming.  Other cases can be far lengthier and complex, particularly where many different laws are in play.  This has been especially the case with complaints, for example, about receiverships and liquidations and about cases involving disputes between employers and employees.<\/p><p> The second function of the Data Protection Commission is to conduct inquiries and investigations regarding potential infringements of data protection legislation and to enforce the law as required using corrective measures and, now, administrative fines.  In 2018, large-scale investigations that were under way included the investigation into the public services card; a finalised report and findings into non-compliance by the hospitals sector; 32 investigations into surveillance of citizens by the State sector through the use of technologies such as CCTV, body-worn cameras, automatic number plate recognition systems, drones and other technologies; and 15 investigations of a range of issues concerning so-called big tech companies.  A final report and set of directions for compliance were also issued to Yahoo! EMEA Limited in respect of infringements relating to what was at the time the largest global data breach ever notified.  Further, the DPC in 2018 issued a significant decision against the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, regarding access to personal data, and details of this decision feature in the DPC's first annual report for 2018.  There were also nine sets of District Court prosecutions taken by the DPC, which concluded during 2018.  Eight of those concluded successfully, with costs awarded to the DPC and the final case being withdrawn due to compliance by the data controller.<\/p><p> The third function of the DPC is to promote awareness among organisations and the public of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in the processing of personal data.  More than 50,000 contacts by email, telephone and web forms were received through the DPC&rsquo;s information and assessment unit in 2018.  A number of campaigns via the DPC website and in the national media were run by the DPC in 2018 to drive readiness for the GDPR.  These included the launch of a comprehensive public consultation on children&rsquo;s data.  By the end of the awareness campaigns the DPC ran in 2018, 80% of Irish adults had been reached and, based on an independent survey commissioned by the DPC, 90% of SMEs were aware of the GDPR.<\/p><p> Fourth, we have a function in co-operating with data protection authorities in other EU member states on issues such as complaints and alleged infringements involving multinationals.  In excess of 80 European Data Protection Board meetings were attended in Brussels by DPC staff in 2018.  As of last year, EU data protection authorities use a shared IT platform to transfer and exchange information on cases, and more than one third of the cases on this IMI platform were assigned to the Irish DPC in accordance with the rules of the one-stop shop.  Delivery of a harmonised implementation of the GDPR across the EU is central to the aims of the new law.<\/p><p> The fifth function of the DPC is to assess breach notifications from organisations that now have a mandatory obligation under the GDPR to report to the DPC and to ensure mitigation actions have been taken.  A total of 4,740 valid data breaches were notified in the 2018 calendar year, which represents a significant increase over 2017.  Each of these breach notifications was individually assessed and engagement with the reporting organisation took place, giving the DPC an opportunity to make recommendations on procedural and security mitigation measures to be put in place.<\/p><p> The funding of the DPC by Government has increased significantly in recent years, from &euro;1.7 million in 2013 to &euro;11.7 million in 2018, which comprised an allocation of &euro;7.3 million for pay and &euro;4.4 million for non-pay expenditure.  The allocation was further increased for 2019 with a total allocation of &euro;15.28 million.  This commitment of additional budget has allowed the DPC to grow its staff from 27 in 2014 up to 110 at the end of 2018 and now to 138 today.<\/p><p> The majority of expenditure at the DPC relates to salary costs.  The outturn on salaries for 2018 was &euro;4.767 million.  During 2018, the DPC added an additional 25 staff, all of whom were recruited through specialist competitive recruitment campaigns to ensure the DPC has the legal, technological, investigative and communications staff it requires to deliver on its mandate.<\/p><p> The DPC non-pay expenditure outturn was &euro;3.286 million for 2018.  It was composed mainly of office accommodation costs, communications costs, legal fees and costs, and business advisory services to prepare the DPC for GDPR.  Legal fees and costs represent the biggest category of non-pay expenditure, and such cases will continue be a feature of the work of the Irish DPC, particularly now as punitive fines and measures can be imposed against organisations.  Irish law allows a right of appeal by affected parties against decisions of the DPC.  Currently, the DPC has 24 live civil litigation cases active in the courts.<\/p><p> In addition, the DPC initiated what has been one of the most significant data protection cases in the EU when it brought a High Court application in May 2016 seeking a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, on the validity of an EU legal instrument underpinning personal data transfers in a case involving Facebook and Max Schrems, a data protection activist.  The case is of fundamental importance to the determination of core issues of data protection under EU law and has drawn global media coverage and worldwide interest far beyond the data protection community.  The outcome of the case potentially will have worldwide ramifications for data transfers out of the EU and is being closely followed by data protection regulators, law makers and the data protection community.  A decision of the CJEU is awaited in late 2019 or early 2020.<\/p><p> I hope I can assist the committee further with responses to any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dixon for her opening statement.

In fact, Deputy Cullinane will see from the correspondence on 22 August that I was open to meeting once that implementation plan was tabled.  I did not hear anything further about a meeting until correspondence from the Secretary General on 3 September.  The correspondence issued to me after a press statement had issued from the Department earlier that day and the Minister had done some rounds of media, all of which indicated that the findings of the Data Protection Commission were to be rejected and that the findings were to be challenged.  By the time the correspondence of 3 September landed, which confirmed that the Department did not intend to comply with any of the directions that had been issued, it was out of the question that a meeting would be appropriate.  I will quote accurately from the correspondence of 3 September from the Department:<\/p><blockquote>However, given the strong and sincerely held differences in opinion between your Office and both Departments, [it is referring to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform] (based on the advice received from the Office of the Attorney General), as to the correct interpretation ... of the relevant legal text and ... the import of this difference in interpretation not just for the PSC and SAFE 2 and the organisations and citizens that rely on them.<\/blockquote> <p>I will find the relevant section.<\/p><blockquote>The Minister wishes it to be known that she is anxious that her officials and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should engage in discussions with your office to determine if there are any measures that can be agreed, without prejudice to our respective positions, that might address the Commission's concerns and negate the requirement for any Enforcement proceedings.<\/blockquote> <p>It was entirely inappropriate that we would engage in a meeting where we had issued finalised findings and clear directions as to what was required to bring it into compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I accept that.

It states that a person shall produce his or her public services card if requested to do so.  The real nub of the issue is around the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection processing personal data where the necessity test has not been met.  Typically, under data protection law, for a government department, legislative underpinning will be an element of lawful basis, and there are certain provisions in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, but it is not the only condition for lawful basis; the necessity for the processing also has to be borne out.  The issue, therefore, does in part centre on the subsection the Deputy has mentioned because under section 263(1), the Minister has an enabling power that allows her to issue a PSC.  What is at issue, looking at the analysis we have conducted, is that a number of provisions in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act relate to social welfare benefit payments.  Under section 241, a person is required to satisfy the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection as to his or her identity when obtaining a benefit.  Section 242 sets out that there are two means by which identity can be satisfied, one of those being by means of the PSC.  In addition, section 247 sets out consequences of failing to satisfy the Minister in this regard.  There are, then, a range of provisions specific to social welfare payments that ultimately, on a fine balance, led us to a conclusion that the necessity for the processing regarding social welfare claimants is set down-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#Q01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>But not for everything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#Q01400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>-----but that those provisions are absent regarding why there is a necessity for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to process personal data in respect of transactions with specified bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#Q01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>That is quite clear and explained precisely.

The Data Protection Commission received 4,113 complaints in 2018, which was a 56% increase on 2017.  This indicates that this is moving in a certain direction.  After the commission's findings it will require additional resources, and I support resourcing the commission's work.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the European Data Protection Board, the Data Protection Commission is the lead authority in a number of areas.  These include issues related to data involving all the multinational companies located here; the Privacy Shield agreement between the US and the EU; Article 47 of the EU charter and where one of them meets and the other or does not; the processing and transfer of data and the use of that data in the US; and the case the commission was involved in with Facebook and Mr. Max Schrems.  The Schrems case which, in terms of scale, has received worldwide attention.  I have deep concerns about the potential for other cases of similar scale given the geographical area the commission has to cover.  I share Ms Dixon's concerns but, while I would love to do so, we will not have time to get into data-specific issues.  I will, therefore, zone in on the position from a legal findings point of view into the future.  We have to look at organisational process, etc.  The Data Protection Commission is the lead European authority and has jurisdiction over various companies.  These cases can go on for years and can have dramatic impacts in our modern world.  I support the work the commission does but these cases can be highly costly.  Who picks up the tab for them?  Is it the Irish taxpayer or is it shared across Europe in all cases?  I have read the cost is shared but is that always the case?  Obviously, there is a lead cost given that we have such jurisdiction.  To open up a can of worms, if we lost one of these cases, who would pay?  Do we pay collectively or is there a potential issue for the Irish taxpayer?  This could be something to protect the commission into the future.

The Irish taxpayer has incurred costs already in the case the Deputy referenced that is before the Court of Justice of the European Union on transfers of data because it arose from a complaint by Max Schrems against Facebook Ireland.  Facebook Ireland being located here means that we are responsible.  However, under this co-operation and consistency mechanism that now operates around the one-stop shop in the EU, I have to circulate a draft decision on any of these cases that concern multinationals to my fellow EU data protection authorities.  If, ultimately, they have a different view that I cannot reconcile into my findings, I institute a dispute resolution mechanism before the European Data Protection Board and it may take over the decision-making.  If a company affected by that decision disagrees with it, it takes an annulment action to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  There would be a certain number of cases that may end up being taken out of Ireland's hands because of disagreement between data protection authorities.  The European Data Protection Board will then have to bear the cost of defending those cases before the Court of Justice.

We bring to bear a range of factors in terms of the risk-based analysis.

One aspect of those 32 investigations is looking at section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides the legislative basis for CCTV for security purposes in public places.  A range of issues will fall out of those investigations.  The Data Protection Commission has a dedicated consultation team that can look at other areas.  All sorts of organisations seek formal and informal consultations with the commission.  If they have something that is at concept stage, they might run it by us to see what data protection issues might arise.  Equally, they might consult us on the detail of something that is more advanced.  In many instances, organisations are required to have a data protection officer who should be the first line of defence when new things are being implemented.  In cases like that referenced by the Deputy, they are required to conduct data protection impact assessments on a mandatory basis.  The type of analysis that takes place as part of a data protection impact assessment that is conducted properly will lead to the correct answers and outcomes.  We engage with organisations on data protection impact assessments.  They are conducting the issues that are arising.

The Minister quoted it last night but she quoted arguments given by the Department and not the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General sensibly, clearly and in a moderate way stated that there was no one business plan at inception.  He said he believed it was very good and that it had good points and elements of good practice but that there were a number of omissions and partly addressed matters.  This report dates from September 2016 and it puts the reader on notice that there is no business case.<\/p><p>In terms of value for money, where is the business case?  The contract for &euro;3 million, to be rolled out by 2016, did not happen and it was way under that.  A new contract was entered into with advance payments to the company.  Lots of bodies come before us and we haul them over the coals for a business case, for a rationale for why something is necessary or to tell us the benefits of something.  If I accept Ms Dixon's report, the benefits are illusory, particularly in the area of making services available.  It was supposed to be an enabler but it has become an inhibitor.  It was supposed to make it easy for Departments to roll out their services but that has not happened.

It says that, in part, it is because there have been very few suitable properties on the market that it can make available.  The other response I believe it would give is that the building requirements we have specified pose particular challenges.  The Deputy may be aware that at a data protection conference in Dublin just this week one of the presenters put up a very large photo of the office in Portarlington, which is located over a supermarket.  This photograph has been circulated globally with commentary to the effect that this is how seriously Ireland takes data protection.  As such, we have specified to the Office of Public Works that we ideally need a standalone building which is not co-located with Government Departments to reflect our independence.  We also ideally need a building that is located centrally in Dublin, near to the large entities we supervise.

It is worth mentioning that the legal costs awarded against the Data Protection Commission in respect of cases coming to a conclusion in 2018 were exceptional.  The first very significant amount is that paid in costs to Max Schrems as a result of the judicial review he took in 2014 that gave rise to a reference case to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which was ultimately remitted back to the Irish High Court.  He was awarded his costs from that action because the Court of Justice of the European Union found that he had a valid complaint.  A cost demand of &euro;900,000 was submitted to the Data Protection Commission in respect of his estimate of costs.  We considered that to be excessive and hired a legal costs accountant who engaged in a taxation process and we succeeded in having the claim reduced to &euro;300,000.  Therefore, of the nearly half a million euro mentioned, &euro;300,000 relates to Max Schrems's costs arising from that particular case.  The other significant amount included relates to costs awarded to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter.  He took an appeal against a decision of the then commissioner in 2014 with regard to a case that involved the former Deputy, Mick Wallace.  He lost in the Circuit Court but appealed to the High Court, which took a different view from that of the Circuit Court.  Ultimately costs followed from the judgment of the High Court.  His costs were &euro;97,848.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#X02900","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Would it be possible to get a note on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#X03000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Yes.

There is a range of issues around transparency concerning what the card is or is not and what it represents proof of.  There are even issues with where the card can be presented as an ID card.  Section 263 of the Social Welfare Act 2005 provides that any entity which is not a specified body under the legislation cannot have the card presented to it.  There seems to be some evidence that individuals are using the card as an ID when they go to the credit union and are required to provide ID.

The request to the delegates to appear before the committee was issued to them last July, well before the events of later in the summer.  Issues relating to the public services card were raised at previous meetings of the committee, which led to my request for a meeting with the delegates.  One of those issues concerned the large social media companies registered in Ireland within an EU context, and the role of the Irish Data Protection Commission, not just in an Irish and European context but also in a worldwide context.  It is a relatively small office which has been getting larger as the years go by.  As such, my concern is whether there is the scope, ability and resources within the organisation to deal with its new responsibilities.  That was my motivation as Chairman in inviting the delegates to appear before the committee.

I will give Ms Dixon a little warning.  The record of the Office of Public Works, OPW, in moving public bodies is not as good as its people will claim.  Every time it moves a public body, there is grief involved.  The moves are not properly planned.  The Department of Health was moved to Baggot Street and the measurements in the building were wrong.  There were arguments about staff, open space and all sorts of matters.  The final cost for the life of the lease remains to be determined.  The OPW did not get it right.  It came to Leinster House to work on a project in the building.  While we acknowledge that it is an historic building, the cost rose.  Representatives from the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, appeared before the committee last year and I draw a parallel between it and the DPC.  They stated the TAC had nothing but grief from the OPW during their office's move.  We have yet to invite an organisation to appear before the committee that has stated the OPW efficiently managed a transition to a new office.  I hope the DPC will be the first but we have not yet heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#BB01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":590,"content":"<p>We moved a couple of years ago-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#BB01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Did the Comptroller and Auditor General do okay?

Everyone says that the OPW is wonderful but it is not.  We have not found it to be.  Whoever manages the project on the DPC's side should not believe everything he or she is told.  He or she should double-check because we have found organisations indicating that they experienced a great deal of grief.  That is a general comment for our guests from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform more than anything else.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance published legislation concerning the TAC this week to increase the number of commissioners from one to two.  When the TAC was being set up as a new body, the Department did not adequately project its work programme.  It was under-resourced, therefore, from year one, and there have been backlogs and delays.  The backlogs continue and the Department is beginning to increase the commission's resources to a reasonable level.  I am worried the same will happen in the case of the DPC.  I make these remarks as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to the senior personnel throughout the public service.  When a new body is set up, the mere setting-up of the body will attract business.  That the DPC exists, that it has a new office, that it has received great prominence and that it has issued the report will, in itself, increase public awareness and bring more cases.  The public sector has never adequately projected an increase in such activity.  I hope the increase in resources the DPC seeks will meet the demand next year and in the following years.  We might find that an additional &euro;5 million is sufficient but events might take over and it could be well short of the mark.  My advice is that the DPC should be cautious because other public bodies have struggled with resources in the early stages of their lifespan.<\/p> <p>  As a Deputy, I represent Portarlington in County Laois.

This year, in particular, a little later than one would have hoped, there was a repainting of the front of the building to reflect the name of the Data Protection Commission as opposed to that of the Data Protection Commissioner, and that has been completed.  The plans for the office are that it is business as usual.  The staff are a critical part of our infrastructure and team.

By that, I am referring in part to that IMI IT platform that we use to share details on cases between us.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues have arisen for us as a board in the first year in terms of complaints that have been lodged with a data protection authority in an EU member state that then have to be transmitted to the Irish DPC for investigation.  There have been issues in terms of translation of the complaints and timeframes involved in transmitting the case to the Irish Data Protection Commission.  In those cases, we are obliged to communicate with the complainant back through the originating data protection authority.  We have a journey to go as a board in terms of smoothing out all of those handoffs that have now become part of the process.<\/p> <p>  Issues have also arisen in the first year around different administrative law procedure in the different EU member states.  While we are conducting an investigation, we would never release full information on the investigation while it is under investigation, and the transparency rules in other member states and their administrative laws have different procedures that impact on those issues.<\/p> <p>  We are very active members of the European Data Protection Board.  We have led as rapporteur on some of the big guidance projects that the EDPB has undertaken in terms of publishing guidance.  Ultimately when we complete the decision-making process on these investigations we have under way - I mentioned earlier that under Article 60 of the GDPR I cannot finalise a decision on my own; I must transmit it as a draft and allow every other EU data protection authority that is concerned with the issue give input.  Any of those data protection authorities or a multiple of them can raise what is called a relevant and reasoned objection to any part of my draft decision.  I am then obliged to try to reconcile what they raise with me as an objection with my findings.  Ultimately if I cannot, under Article 65 of the GDPR I then institute the dispute resolution mechanism of the European Data Protection Board.

Ultimately, they are subject to one decision by one enforcer and there is one appeal that can be taken and one fine ultimately.

One of the specific conditions is that the data controller must be EU territorially based to avail of the one-stop shop.

She mentioned the travel pass a few times and perhaps she will tell me if I am right or wrong on this issue.  Deputies meet constituents with different problems.  I met a person who is a carer and had the travel pass as part of the social welfare card, which they could present to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to travel to and from Dublin or as the case may be.  A point came when this person was no longer a carer and was, by right, no longer entitled to use the card.  The card still worked for free travel, however.  Four or five months later, the person got a bill from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for &euro;1,048 along with a list of all of the dates on which the card had been used since the point at which, in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's opinion, the person was no longer deemed to be a carer.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann used the public services card to collect information on the number of rail trips the person made.  One day the person arrived in Heuston Station and could not pass through the gate because Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had obviously been in touch with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":676,"content":"<p>We would be very interested in looking at that in the context of the findings I am about to issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Ms Dixon gets the story I told. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Yes, I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann used that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Presumably, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would have known of the trips that were taken and it was reimbursed for some but not for others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Will Mr. McCarthy explain that again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would have had to claim for the payments in relation-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Is that the way it works?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I think so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":685,"content":"<p>It is not like the bus where people just hop on and the the company gets a grant.

I understand Ms Dixon said the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2015 was very hard to follow and unclear.  She was critical on the basis that it was not clear how the whole system worked.  She was accused of using pejorative and sensationalist language.  I will make one point in her defence on that issue.  We had a special debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday on the public services card.  The card was introduced in the 2005 Act.  Section 263 has been amended six times in three different pieces of primary legislation.  A further provision on which the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection relies in relation to the public services card project is section 241, which has been amended 28 times by 11 different enactments.  This demonstrates, from a legislative point of view, a lack of consolidation.  We have here a provision that has been amended 30 or 40 times, including every year in the Social Welfare Act.  The legislation that underpins the public services card has been amended at least 50 times.  How could any reasonable citizen be expected to know what legislation he or she is looking at?  The commissioner's criticism was, therefore, very valid.  It applies to social protection legislation because it is not consolidated often enough but probably also applies to many other public bodies for which legislation is repeatedly amended.  How could anyone find their way back through the 50 different amendments? <\/p> <p>  This discussion has been nice and rosy so far.  However, it would be remiss of me not to voice the numerous complaints people have made since the introduction of GDPR.  I know GDPR is needed for good reason but citizens are being strangled by it.  GDPR is designed to help citizens and I will give one example of how the legislation the Data Protection Commission is enforcing works on the ground.  I have umpteen examples but I will give this example because it arose last weekend.  There is an old couple who live in my constituency.  The husband, who is 96 years of age, is deaf, has dementia and is confined to bed.  His wife is 86 years of age and is not faring much better.  They live on their own and use a community alert device operated via their landline to buzz if something happens.  Lightning knocked out their telephone last Friday night.  When a carer phoned Eir on her mobile phone from the couple's home she was told the provider could not speak to her as she was not the account holder.  The woman of the house then spoke but was told that as she was not the account holder, she could not speak on her husband's behalf.  Her husband is deaf and cannot speak on the phone.  The 85-year old woman was then told that if the couple changed the account on the website from the husband's name into the wife's name, the company would speak to the woman.  The husband and wife are both bedridden.  I got on the case and I have been involved in identical cases.<\/p> <p>  I will give another example involving another good neighbour.  Every Deputy can recite a litany of these cases.  The Data Protection Commission gets flak on this one issue from many people.  People may or may not agree with some of what is going on.  The second case involves an old person living in an isolated area.  The landline went down and because there is no mobile signal where the person lives, they could not make a mobile call.  A good neighbour who visits every day volunteered to ring on the old person's behalf but the provider would not speak with the neighbour as this person is not the account holder.  Does Ms Dixon accept that in extreme cases the legislation can, when implemented as the commission intended, cause enormous personal hardship in a many cases?  Does she understand my point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE03400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE03500","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":701,"content":"<p>These are genuine cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE03600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":702,"content":"<p>That is not implementation of the legislation as the data protection authority intends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE03700","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1569484800,"counter":703,"content":"<p>The authority is blamed for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019092600002#EE03800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569484800,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I am aware of that.
