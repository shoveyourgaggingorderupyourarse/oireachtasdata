Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a h-anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach knows, workers and families are being hammered by unprecedented surges in energy bills.  Households have been hit by more than 50 price hikes since the beginning of last year with more to come.  To underscore the seriousness of the situation, a Government memo seen by the media last week states that 1 million households could face annual energy bills of &euro;6,000 if prices keep rising at the current rate.  This prediction will have sent a shiver down the spines of people who are already struggling to light and heat their homes.<\/p>  <p>  We now head into the winter.  We have darker days and longer nights, and households&rsquo; use of energy will increase significantly at a time when prices are through the roof, which will only add to the unbearable pressure people are under.  The hard truth is that many households will go under trying to pay these extortionate bills unless the Government makes the right intervention.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much kite-flying from the Government, mainly centred around further energy credits.  While energy credits are well and good, they do not provide certainty.  They do not protect people from the continuous barrage of hikes.  In fact, when the Government introduced its initial energy credit, it was too slow.  It was wiped out by further price hikes before it even landed into people&rsquo;s accounts.  Therefore, this is clearly a flawed approach.  Households need a Government response that matches the scale of the crisis.  I believe the Government must take action to cut electricity prices to pre-crisis levels and apply a cap to freeze them at that level until the end of February of next year.  The benefit of this measure is twofold.  First, it ensures that electricity bills are more affordable, and, additionally and crucially, it provides households with the certainty they need at these difficult times.  It provides certainty that their electricity bills will be brought down, that the relief provided will not be swallowed up by future price hikes and that they can get through the winter months.  Cutting electricity bills and freezing them at pre-crisis levels will deliver that assurance.  It simply makes sense and yet speaking on radio yesterday, the Taoiseach ruled this out.  His colleague, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, echoed this, suggesting that things should simply be worked out at an EU Level.  I know that people have heard that line before.  They have heard that line used as an alibi for the slow response of the Government to this crisis that left households struggling for months.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; in am bill&iacute; leictreachais a ghearradh agus caidhp a chur ar bhill&iacute; chun iad a choinne&aacute;il ag an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; siad roimh an ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im.

In the budget, the Government must choose to cut electricity bills and to cap them at pre-crisis levels.  It is the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>It is the only measure that can provide some level of certainty for households.  It would prevent future price hikes and ease the burden on hard-pressed workers and families.  By cutting and then capping electricity bills, the Government could choose to protect households.

We need to be very clear about that at all times in assessing and in how we respond to this issue.  It is having massive consequences for the entirety of Europe, so it makes sense that Ireland respond as part of the wider European Union framework.  We are not just relying on EU measures alone, as the Deputy wrongly suggested in remarking on the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath's comments yesterday, but the European Union framework is extremely important.<\/p>  <p>  We import from the United Kingdom three quarters of the natural gas that we use, but half of our electricity is generated using gas, so spiralling gas prices feed through to higher electricity bills.  The price for UK natural gas on wholesale markets today is &pound;3.92 per therm.  This day two years ago, the price was 32p per therm.  We are talking about a more than tenfold increase, more than 1,000%, in international gas prices.  Future markets are pointing to even higher prices in the coming months.  A therm of gas to be delivered in December will cost &pound;5.74.  A February delivery is priced at &pound;5.43.  Importantly, non-energy prices are also now surging, with food and other grocery prices rising rapidly and putting severe pressure on household budgets.  That is the context.<\/p>  <p>  My second point is that the need to intervene in a very significant manner is not questioned.  There is no debate about that - the Government is very clear that we have to intervene, as we did last year with the &euro;2.5 billion package on the cost of living.  Just like we did during Covid, the Government will intervene again to protect households and jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The issue that the Deputy has put forward is one of methodology, of mechanism, that is, what is the best way of intervening to protect people.  The Deputy's view is, and the Sinn F&eacute;in position is, that we should give a blank cheque to energy companies in a kind of singular, almost isolated approached to this crisis, which is now much more than an energy crisis for many households.  The Government's view is that, for the time being, we want to get people through the winter to the end of March, not the end of February.  We have got to do it using a range of measures in terms of reducing electricity bills but also in giving flexibility to people in the form of payments that we give them either through the welfare system, through energy credits, through cost reductions or through investment in public services in the budget, which will also reduce costs for parents and families.  There is a range of mechanisms that we can use.<\/p>  <p>  I would ask the Deputy for a fully costed paper from her in terms of her proposals.  If she does not mind me saying so, I was less than convinced by her presentation on \"Morning Ireland\" yesterday.  I genuinely would like a fully costed proposal from her in respect of her chosen method of intervention in the electricity price market.<\/p> <p>I believe we have to target measures to those who need them the most, but also, universally, people will need support.  We need to focus on protecting jobs because, clearly, many jobs could be at risk if enterprises become unviable because of the extraordinary increase in energy costs I have just outlined and that is, obviously, a global phenomenon.  However, because of the sound management of the economy, we have resources we can allocate to reduce pressures on people and protect jobs, and that is what we intend to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400005#C00600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663161600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Not for the first time but once again, the Taoiseach is totally and utterly wrong in his response here.

Interventions at European level are, of course, necessary and welcome, but they should not be used again as an excuse for the Government to delay and dither and sit on its hands.  In fact, our proposal would work in tandem with the proposed EU measures.

There is also the non-energy inflation, which is now running at approximately 6% and is a serious worry in terms of the inflationary cycle we are currently going through.

I also note the very positive contribution their queen made to relations between Britain and Ireland on her visit here, not just to Cork but also to Dublin and other parts of the country in 2011.  We all remember that visit with great affection.  I pay tribute again to the contribution that state visit alone made to improving relations between our islands.<\/p>  <p>  As the D&aacute;il and Seanad resume today, we face into a bleak winter with dark clouds gathering on the horizon, and I think all of us are very conscious of that, as we see energy bills increasing dramatically for so many struggling households and families.  Households are facing the dreadful prospect of energy bills that could reach &euro;6,000 per annum next year.<\/p> <p>Small businesses are telling us that their energy bills are now as much as their rent and it is like paying a second rent for many SMEs.  People and small business owners are really scared.  They are facing into this very frightening period ahead, and they want to see some certainty, security and reassurance and also a sense of urgency from this Government.  There is one way in which we believe the Government can and should act with greater urgency.  We want to see a really clear signal that the exorbitant profits being made by energy companies will be targeted, and that we are not going to see those take precedence over the real prospect of energy poverty for so many households, families and businesses.  We know that many of our EU partners have already taken action on energy bills.  We know that in the budget to be published in the coming weeks, it will mean the difference for so many families between being able to get by or having to choose between heating and eating as they see bills for food as well as fuel skyrocketing.  We know also there are jobs at risk here.<\/p> <p> Can the Taoiseach's Government act swiftly on this issue to introduce a range of measures, but in particular, a windfall tax to target profits and to fund the other measures that will be needed to alleviate hardship for families?  In January of this year, we, in the Labour Party, first called for a tax on the profits of energy companies.  The best time for Government to have introduced that measure would have been then, but clearly now it is still extremely important that it be done.  Indeed, the British Government did it in July, the Italian Government did something similar, and we are seeing moves at EU level.  We need that immediate introduction of a windfall tax alongside an immediate maximum price cap on energy bills and the third prong for which we have called, namely, the extension of eligibility for the fuel allowance to more households, including low- and middle-income households.  We have the costings.  We know it would cost &euro;15 million to raise the threshold to &euro;250 per week.  That would bring quite a number of households back into the eligibility criteria and alleviate significant hardship.  We need to bring in these measures to ensure that the excessive profits of energy companies are harnessed by this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400006#D01400","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>First of all, I agree with the Deputy in her analysis.  It is going to be a difficult winter, but it is our responsibility to do everything we possibly can to reduce the pressures on households in respect of energy costs, and also to protect jobs in society.  I appreciate the fact that the Deputy is clear about the need to work through the European framework in terms of carbon tax or a mechanism to take the windfall gains made by energy companies, and particularly non-gas generation, which is getting a revenue that it would never have dreamt of because of this crisis.  As the President of the Commission said this morning, it is not fair that companies would make exorbitant profits on the back of a war and a people, in the exploitation of a crisis.  That is why we are supportive of EU measures to intervene so that those windfall revenues would accrue to the State and to member states.  The precise mechanism is still being worked out at EU level.  There was a meeting last week of the EU energy ministers, and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications was there.  The Commission is due to publish a proposal this week to include measures aimed at addressing windfall gains by non-gas generation and the electricity sector, and in fossil fuel extraction and production.  These proposals will raise additional revenues which will be used to reduce the cost of energy for society.  They may not come immediately, but they will be an important stream of revenue in terms of the duration of this crisis.  We have a surplus to the end of the year.  We will use that as effectively and efficiently as we can to alleviate pressures on people, but we also need a more ongoing revenue stream to deal with perhaps a prolongation of this crisis, which we do not want to see.  The EU is keen to do everything it can to try to stabilise and reform the market, but that will take a bit longer.<\/p>  <p>  I do not disagree with the Deputy at all on the need to make sure that those exorbitant revenues and the type of extraordinary increases that companies have benefited from are dealt with.  The Sinn F&eacute;in leader criticised the Government for wanting to go through the EU framework on this matter.  We are members of the EU.  We believe we should work through the EU on matters of this kind.  Sinn F&eacute;in may have a different view on being a member of the EU.  That is its prerogative.  I take the Deputy's point.  This is complex stuff.  The Deputy mentioned the UK.  The UK had a 95% offset for investment, so how real was that tax?<\/p> <p>The European Union is focusing on the excessive revenue being generated, which cannot be justified or maintained, and we are supportive of that.

At that stage it was being warned that people may be facing increases of about &euro;500 per year in energy costs.  Needless to say, the Government completely dismissed and voted against the proposals for price controls and the renationalisation of the energy sector.  Ordinary families, working people, pensioners, people with disabilities and those on low and middle incomes have suffered the bitter fruits of the Government&rsquo;s failure to support those measures one year ago.  Since then, the crisis has got very much worse.  We are not looking at &euro;500 per year increases but at energy costs doubling and trebling.  Some estimates suggest they will go from an average of &euro;2,000 per year to &euro;6,000 per year.<\/p>  <p>  People are being crucified.  These hikes are simply not affordable for huge numbers of people and on Saturday, 24 September at 2.30 p.m. in Parnell Square, I expect there to be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of angry and frightened workers, pensioners, students, people with disabilities and ordinary people appealing to the Government once again to take decisive measures to protect them against a cost-of-living crisis that is crucifying them and against an ongoing housing crisis.<\/p> <p>It is very simple.  Heating your home is not an optional extra.  Having a shower and hot water are not optional extras.  Having an affordable roof over your head is not an optional extra.  Having the money to pay bills and put food on the table for your family are not optional extras but necessities.  The Government has to guarantee that those needs of ordinary people, families and vulnerable people are met this year.<\/p> <p> The people will march for energy price controls and controls on the price of food.  They will call for controls on rent, to make housing affordable and to keep incomes, whether pensions or wages, in line with inflation costs.  It is long past time that we took the companies profiteering from this cost-of-living crisis back into public ownership.  Nationalise the energy sector and run it on a not-for-profit basis because heating, hot water and electricity are needs and not optional extras.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400008#F00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663163100,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I will make two points to the Deputy.

The Deputy seems incapable of articulating that in the context of this energy crisis, as do many on the left, for some strange reason.  The bottom line is Putin's war in Ukraine and his weaponisation of energy constitute a major factor in the extraordinary price hikes we are witnessing.  That said, we have to intervene, will intervene and did intervene since the Deputy raised it 12 months ago.

We cut public transport fare by 20% with an additional 50% cut in fares for young people, reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills until the end of October and gave a &euro;200 energy credit to all households.

The cost-of-living crisis is hammering people&rsquo;s ability to live and the housing crisis is threatening hundreds of thousands of families with homelessness and spiking rack rents.  Despite all the Taoiseach said, the response of this Government has been stifling inertia in the face of these crises.  Going by the rate of action of this Government, the only thing that will remain warm this winter is its own hands because it has been sitting on them all of this time.  Such is the degree of the cluster of crises in our country that the massive health crisis we face is being eclipsed.  However, it is still a life and death issue that is looming large in millions of people&rsquo;s lives.  Some 1.3 million people are on hospital waiting lists at this moment in time.  According to the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, mental health services are in crisis due to the lack of investment and soaring demand.  The GP system, which was one of the few remaining functioning elements of the health service, is now broken.  People are waiting up to two weeks to get an appointment.  Hundreds of GPs are emigrating and moving to Australia every year.  Accident and emergency departments are dealing with record waiting times.  People are waiting 24 hours in Tallaght.  University Hospital Limerick is like a warzone.  Over the summer, every hospital in the Meath area at some stage advised patients not to come near them because of the pressure they were under.  It is now stated that 360 people a year die in the State due to delays in accident and emergency departments.  A figure equivalent to twice the number of elected Deputies in this State are dying every year due to dysfunction and waiting times in accident and emergency departments around the country.  In the middle of all of this and just before we face a new wave of Covid and flu, the HSE has decided to close key capacity in the accident and emergency department in Meath.  So removed is the HSE that 23 consultants in Drogheda hospital had to write a letter to the Minister for Health stating that if this action was to proceed, it would present a threat to people&rsquo;s health.<\/p> <p>The decision was paused by the Minister.  We welcome that.  The CEO of the HSE, Paul Reid, then resigned and a so-called review was started.

The vast majority of the 220,000 people who live in Meath at the moment are absolutely opposed to the HSE plan to close down the accident and emergency department.  We will resist any efforts to make our region a University Hospital Limerick mark II.  The Taoiseach should mark my words.  On Friday at 1 p.m., the people of Meath will march again in Kells.<\/p> <p>It is the constituency of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.  This march will be led by a number of funeral hearses to make sure that the Government knows that this is a life or death issue for the people of Meath.  Thousands of people are alive in this county because of that emergency department.  What we are asking is reasonable.  We ask that the review include a feasibility study on what it would take to make Navan functional and safe for the people of Meath in the future.  We want that to be fully included in the terms of reference-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400011#J03600","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663164600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400012#K00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1663164600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>-----in black and white, not just as a Minister's promise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400012#K00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1663164600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The Deputy brought it back to the march.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400012#K00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663164600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>People power is the only thing that is saving it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400012#K00500","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1663164600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>It is about having an honest, frank discussion and consultation between all involved about the right care for patients at the right time.

I put it to the Taoiseach that it is the banks that should absorb this hike and not pass it on to customers.  Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Minister for Finance on this matter?

There has been quite an interesting increase in first-time buyers, and that is because of the help to buy scheme and the first-time owner's scheme the Minister has brought in.  We have good measures to help young people around affordability.  For those with existing mortgages, ideally the banks should be in a position to absorb these increases and we will monitor the situation.  The Minister for Finance keeps in regular contact with the banks on a range of issues, but suffice it to say this will obviously create pressure for homeowners in terms of an increase in rates.

Our proposal is that the Government would introduce in the forthcoming budget a ticket for unlimited public transport journeys around Ireland for everyone for &euro;9 per month.  If the Government were to do this, even on a three-month trial basis to the end of the year, it would cost about &euro;150 million.

In Cork South-West I have been working with families since this time last year who warned the Department and pleaded for the resources to ensure their children could exercise their right to education.  One child with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, whose name is Charlie, has been moved between three primary schools.  The special educational needs organiser, SENO, overruled the recommendation of the most recent school, and he was then placed in a special class at second level that is not suitable for his needs.  Needless to say, he has regressed due to these circumstances.  Even though an ASD unit is opening in the secondary school that is closest to him, it is already oversubscribed.  His mum asked how it is possible that a post-primary unit is established, but even before it opens, it is oversubscribed.  These children have been in primary education, in the system, for eight years.  The numbers involved are surely relatively clear.

Through the work of the ten Cabinet committees supported by my Department, a range of cross-Government work was advanced during 2021 in line with the strategic priorities set out, for example, management of the whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including the national vaccination programme roll-out.  The economic recovery plan, with a progress report on implementation published in June, is helping to drive a jobs-rich recovery and supporting the economy in transitioning towards a decarbonised and digital economy.

Other work included: delivery of an initial well-being framework for Ireland and a supporting information hub, which are being developed to better understand and measure our progress as a country; the completion of the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality; the launch of the revised national development plan, setting out the roadmap for investment of &euro;165 billion in new and upgraded infrastructure over the decade ahead; the signing into law of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021; the establishment of the marine planning framework; the publication of the Climate Action Plan 2021; and three legislative programmes published during 2021 setting out priority legislation across Government.<\/p><p>My Department's priorities for the coming period will include advancing work to protect energy supply and mitigate the impact of the rising cost of energy; a continued focus on the Government's humanitarian response to the situation in Ukraine; economic recovery and investment; driving delivery of Housing for All and measures on climate action; and progressing health and wider social reforms, EU engagement and Northern Ireland, including continuing to advance our shared island agenda.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, my Department will continue to be responsive to new and emerging challenges.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400019#R02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663168500,"counter":219,"content":"<p>We have five questioners.

I look forward to engaging with the Taoiseach on that.<\/p><p>In terms of strategic priorities for our economic development and social progress, one glaring issue which requires prioritisation by the Taoiseach and Government is childcare and early years education.  The State is currently investing millions into a mostly privately run, for-profit sector, but we are still no closer to the sort of public, universal childcare service for which the Labour Party has long advocated.  Our current system is failing parents, professionals, providers and, most importantly, children.  Every day, I hear from constituents who cannot access any place in childcare and this is particularly the case for babies who are under 12 months old.  One woman who was very distressed contacted me.  Her baby is yet to be born, but she anticipates that she will have immense difficulty in finding any cr&egrave;che place, let alone one that is affordable, particularly until her child reaches 12 months old.  We have seen recent reports in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>citing the average cost per month for childcare in Finland as &euro;150.  The cost in Dublin is almost ten times that at &euro;1,100, &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 per month per child.  We have called for the Government to introduce a radical and creative measure in this budget to cap childcare costs at &euro;200 per month, per child.  We believe that sort of investment by the State would cost approximately &euro;270 million per year to do that.  We believe that would be a real investment in an equal early years approach to children, children's rights and to that ensuring parents would have some help and some support in meeting these exorbitant rising costs that they are facing with childcare, which are like a second mortgage for so many.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400020#S00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1663168500,"counter":221,"content":"<p>The annual report speaks about the role of Ireland in the world.

Instead, and this is not mentioned in the areas of the report dealing with housing, the capital spend on housing at this year is actually 21% lower than it was at the same time last year.  This means that none of the targets on delivering social, affordable or cost-rental homes will be met.  I want to ask the Taoiseach why the Government is failing to meet any of the targets that it is setting itself in terms of housing.  What is it doing to urgently address this?  What emergency action will it take to ensure that people can get the housing that they desperately need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400020#S00500","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1663168500,"counter":223,"content":"<p>In the Taoiseach&rsquo;s capacity as part of the Cabinet Committee on Social Affairs and Equality, I have raised with him on a number of occasions in the last year the issue of Accessible Community Transport Southside Ltd., ACTS, which is a door-to-door, voluntary-run, not-for-profit transport service for people with wheelchairs.  It moves hundreds of people who otherwise could not get out of their homes to go to doctor appointments, to get around, to have a social existence and who cannot use the normal public transport system.  I warned the Taoiseach that it was going to go out of business for the lack of approximately &euro;250,000.  Despite the suggestions that something would be done and that it would be looked at I was absolutely shocked to receive an e-mail from that service today saying that it is winding up.  It is gone.  We see these ACTS buses all around the city.  People in wheelchairs are already obstructed from having equality of access to life, to services, to their doctors and so on and now their service is gone because of the lack of &euro;250,000 and the refusal of the Government to give them the money to provide this service.  It is gone and finished.  Next week, people who have doctor appointments will have no transport to take them there.  They have asked again and again for specialised transport for people with wheelchairs, with severe mobility problems, with disabilities and so on, to be seen as an integral part of our public transport system and for that to be properly funded but because of a failure to do that, that service is now gone.  I ask the Taoiseach what he will do about this because many vulnerable people now have no transport service.  It is shocking and it is shameful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400020#S00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1663168500,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach increased the minimum wage this year by less than 3%, which is in real terms a very serious pay cut for the country's lowest-paid workers.

It placed an emphasis and on obligation on all relevant Departments, including the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, with regard to that.  I understand that the oversight of this legislation and policy rests with the Cabinet Committee on Social Affairs and Equality, which is chaired by the Taoiseach.  We have previously raised concerns about this particular committee and how it operates and, particularly, about the fact that it meets so infrequently to be able to oversee this strategy.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would set out in practice how the committee is working in terms of oversight of the strategy.  The strategy also commits to the establishment of a high-level oversight board, chaired by the Secretaries General of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Justice, with a secretariat from the Department of the Taoiseach.

A whole range of issues were raised there.  Deputy Bacik raised the issue of childcare.  The difficulty is that if we were to move completely to a State system, it would involve very significant engagement with stakeholders to dramatically and radically transform the area.  As I said, we dealt in the last budget with a significant allocation for pay and conditions.  Working between employers and employees, an agreement was arrived at in terms of the two employment regulation orders.  This was good, but this year we have to increase affordability.<\/p> <p>If the Deputy wants to send the details of her proposal to us, I know the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is working on proposals for the forthcoming budget in respect of childcare.  Childcare is very expensive in this country.  We have to try consistently to get the cost down in a programmatic way that sustains into the future from a public finance and expenditure point of view.  We are increasing expenditure on childcare significantly year on year.<\/p> <p> On the question raised by Deputy Murphy, I am not aware of the specific meeting in question, but I would say I do not believe he is correct in his analysis that people are using the war in Ukraine to drive the militarisation of the world or NATO.  I think that is a perverse analysis because nobody wanted the war in Ukraine except Putin.  The leaders of European countries like Germany and France, including Chancellor Scholz and President Macron, did everything they possibly could to prevent the war and to stop a war.  War has consequences.  When a leader wages war in an unprovoked and brutal fashion on a neighbouring country simply because he believes the country does not exist and is possessed by some sort of 19th century imperialist view of the world, then the neighbours of that neighbour have to take note.  The Continent has to take note.  We cannot have an endless continuance of that policy.  That is why people closer to Russia are taking extra measures to protect themselves, unfortunately.  It is why Finland and Sweden have applied to join NATO.  They see it.  I met the Finnish Prime Minister and President.  They are balanced and reasonable people, who have navigated a relationship with Russia for a long time.  Their view is that this brutal invasion of Ukraine has changed everything.  All they were told in their childhoods and the ultimate fear came to be realised in the invasion.  People in Estonia, Poland and the Baltic states more generally are all very anxious and worried about what has happened.  That is the natural response that has occurred.  The vast majority of people obviously would have preferred if this had never happened, and that we did not find ourselves in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400020#S01000","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663169100,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Can we get two or three minutes extra?

I am addressing all the points he made, because I have written down what he said.  We need to study the facts.  The bottom line is that a number of factors have really conspired against us, Covid being one, but more importantly, the war and the increase in the cost of commodities.  However, we are responding to that.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform reformed the public tender framework so that builders would not be caught for the entirety of the inflationary increase and they could continue with social housing projects.  This year we have completed the highest number of social housing projects on record, between approved social housing bodies and local authorities.  Likewise, we are making progress on affordable homes and cost rental.  There is a suite of measures.  The new shared equity scheme is gaining huge traction with young purchasers and the help to buy scheme is impacting on people.  I mentioned earlier there has been an increase in the number of first-time buyers.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are still huge challenges.  We need to build more houses and get houses built.  There are many objections to houses.  There are people and politicians objecting to housing developments.  Leadership needs to start in this House and come from political leaders in these issues.  I believe it is the number one crisis over the constant period that will endure unless we continue to facilitate the construction of houses and not always seek to block, block and block.  Younger people, in particular, deserve to have access to affordable houses.  We need to get up to 35,000 units at least being built annually.  We will do everything we possibly can from a Government perspective.  Some &euro;4 billion a year has been allocated to housing - way above what was allocated before this Government came into office.

I want to raise with the Taoiseach a particular issue pertaining to a service which has been providing a similar service to the public, namely, the Citizens Information service, which over some decades now has been providing a very important face-to-face service across our communities but about which we are hearing increasing concerns.  We have seen changes to the service, the closure of face-to-face offices, a failure to reopen offices after Covid and a whole-scale movement online of these vital information services.  Indeed, over the summer, this issue was raised extensively on \"Liveline\", as people around the country spoke of their concern about hearing their local services were being closed.<\/p> <p>In my constituency, Dublin Bay South, we held a public meeting in Rathmines about the failure to reopen the local office there.  Our local Labour Party councillor, Mary Freehill, and I both had extensive engagement with members of the public about their concerns on this issue.  We had a big turnout at a town hall meeting we held in Rathmines and we heard from those who had been volunteers with the service, and more importantly, from those who had been using the service, including clients of the service and those who had benefited from the face-to-face access to information that it had provided to them.  A whole-scale movement online goes against the ethos of the Citizens Information centres and service.  Labour's Frank Cluskey had originally insisted on the establishment of Citizens Information services in order that people would not effectively be dependent on D&aacute;il Deputies' clinics to find out their rights and to be able to engage with Departments and local authorities.  Now we have a situation where we are seeing face-to-face and community services being stripped down and closed down.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, to ensure there is sufficient resourcing to enable the maintenance and retention of face-to-face community services, such as Citizens Information services of this kind, which have provided such an important bridge to many local communities and individuals in accessing information about their rights and the sort of entitlements they have from the State.  Without this sort of face-to-face service, many disadvantaged individuals and households are really affected and feel they have nowhere to turn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400021#T03300","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663169700,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The role of the parliamentary liaison unit is to ensure that dialogue and so on take place on the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.

The Minister, with the support of the Taoiseach, needs to re-engage with survivors as a matter of urgency and ensure the redress scheme is put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400022#U00300","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1663169700,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I do not know how many schemes there are where it has been suggested that somebody needs to co-ordinate between Departments on the issue of disability.

I find the Taoiseach's earlier response on what has happened to be shocking.  This was a door-to-door transport service for people with powered wheelchairs and three or four buses used to take hundreds of people every day, for years, to medical appointments and to allow them to have a social life because they cannot use the normal public transport system.  By the way, this service did not get a cent from the Department of Transport and it has been begging for a year for money to replace its buses and to deal with a financial shortfall.  This company should not even have to exist because public transport should be doing its job.  It is a not-for-profit involving mostly volunteers and the service is gone.  Some of the most vulnerable people have no way to get to doctor's appointments and to get out of the isolation of their homes next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400022#U00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1663169700,"counter":266,"content":"<p>There is no time left to reply.

I began my visit by meeting representatives of the Council of Europe to mark Ireland's six-month presidency of that body and took the opportunity to visit the European Court of Human Rights and meet with Irish staff members in that court.<\/p>  <p>  At the invitation of the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, I had the honour to address the plenary session of Parliament on 8 June.  I reflected on the 50 years since Ireland voted to join what is now the European Union.  Our membership has been transformative, with an overwhelmingly positive impact across all dimensions of our society.  I expressed Ireland's strong support for Ukraine in the face of the immoral war being waged against it by Russia, and for its application for membership of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Membership is the most powerful tool we possess to enlarge the sphere of democracy, peace and security in our region and in my contribution, I set out my view that the EU should move more swiftly and decisively on enlargement, especially in the western Balkans.  I also took the opportunity to acknowledge the ongoing support and solidarity of our partners in the European Union through the Brexit process.<\/p>  <p>  In concluding my address, I looked to the future, where our guiding principle should be how we can best prepare our Union to continue to meet the needs of its citizens.  The European Union is by no means perfect or complete.   It is a project that must continue to develop and evolve.  Differences will arise between member states, and between the institutions.  However, our capacity to work through these issues together makes the EU something to be immensely proud of.  We are stronger together, and we achieve most and best when we work together.<\/p>  <p>  While at the Parliament, I had a number of bilateral meetings.  I discussed European Union-United Kingdom developments and the protocol with European Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and thanked him for his work in seeking solutions to issues surrounding the protocol.  I met Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, and reaffirmed to him Ireland's strong solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  He expressed his appreciation for the generous response of the Irish people.  I also met David McAllister, MEP, Chair of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, and conveyed Ireland's appreciation for the strong support of the European Parliament on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Together with President Metsola, I unveiled a bust in the European Parliament to honour the life and career of the late John Hume.  It will be a fitting and permanent reminder of John's unwavering commitment to peace on the island of Ireland, and a reflection of his great work achieved in Europe, including as an MEP for 25 years.  John had the vision to see the narrative of Ireland's path to peace in the wider narrative of peace in Europe, a peace built on respect for political and cultural diversity cemented with economic interdependence.  As we see the return of war to our Continent, it is a vision that must remain an inspiration and guide to us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400023#V02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663170300,"counter":311,"content":"<p>This morning President von der Leyen made a speech to the European Parliament about the energy and cost-of-living crisis affecting people across the continent.  She said the energy companies are making revenues they never accounted for or even dreamt of.  She is right about that.  The Taoiseach can look up the figures for the big oil and gas corporations at a global level.  I compared profits year on year, quarter 2 versus quarter 2, and Shell, Exxon, Chevron and BP have all tripled or quadrupled their profits.  In this country, energy companies, while announcing record price increases for people, are also announcing record profits.  It is similar with food companies and big corporate landlords.<\/p>  <p>  The answer of the European Commission is a \"deep and comprehensive reform of the electricity market\".  Is the problem not the fact that it is a market?  Should we not recognise that electricity and energy supply should be a public utility in public control, not run for profit but for provision of this essential supply for people and to ensure a rapid and just transition to a zero-carbon economy?  I think the majority of people agree with that.

We have to recall those who come here fleeing other wars.  In recent days, I have heard real concerns around a resettlement programme for Syrian refugees fleeing war and Afghan refugees who are here and in many cases seeking family reunification, and the need to speed up the processing of their applications.  That is important, alongside the welcome we need to continue to extend to those fleeing the war in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  I return to energy and the EU policy thereon.  We welcome moves at EU level to introduce a windfall tax on the excessive profits of energy companies.  I referred earlier to the Corrib gas field and there is something the Government should do now to address the profits being made there.  The revenues from Corrib increased almost fourfold last year, though nothing has happened to increase the cost of production or supply, nor is there any international competition that would boost the price of Corrib generated gas.  That price has increased dramatically solely as a result of factors which should have no direct impact on the Irish market.  It makes no sense that Corrib gas should be priced as if it was internationally traded and could power German factories in the Rhineland when it is being used here.  I propose the Government invoke existing legislative powers for the duration of the emergency on a temporary basis, to ensure Irish-produced gas is sold to the State on a cost-plus basis, bringing down costs for consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400023#V02900","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1663170300,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I also raise the issue of energy.

It is accepted the challenges may be long term in nature.  The Taoiseach referred to that today and we all know that.  Much of this comes from the brutal war being inflicted on the people of Ukraine and its outcome across Europe.<\/p>  <p>  We all understand that but the most vulnerable people are being hardest hit, particularly in this country.  Many families and businesses are under huge pressure.  I have been contacted by many retail businesses, including Centra and SuperValu shops, in my constituency and across the country. <\/p> <p>The owners run their fridges and try to run their businesses but their costs are going through the roof.  Gourmet Parlour, a bakery in Sligo town, was on to me a couple of months ago about the significant increase in the cost of the energy it needs to produce its products.  It obviously has ovens and so on along with fridges to store raw materials.  All of this has put great pressure on small businesses.  As we know, in many parts of the country where there is no foreign direct investment, we rely on small businesses to keep our economy going.  Those small businesses are under real pressure and a significant input from the Government is required to put a cap on their energy costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400023#V03000","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663170900,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Deputy Paul Murphy was first.  He spoke about President von der Leyen.  I agree with her that excessive profits have been made on the back of the war and the crisis and that there has been a very substantial increase in revenue.  By the end of this month, Europe will have made a decision.  We are leading on that.  We are working with our European partners.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been involved.  As a country, we have made it very clear that we want a mechanism developed, ideally across Europe, to deal with wind generation companies, which is what largely what we have in Ireland.  We have one fossil fuel company, which operates on the Corrib gas field.  Any excess revenues raised on the back of the crisis should be used to help the governments of member states, including our own, to support households and to protect jobs.  That is the agenda.  The gas market is European so it makes sense that this is done across Europe.  A deeper reform of the market is also required.  A key issue is decoupling gas prices from those of energy generated from wind or other sources such as nuclear.  It is not simple.  There are many complexities with regard to the markets.  We are not going to nationalise the entire European Union market.  That is not going to happen.  We have to deal with reality.  We are not going to do that.  We are not in a position to do so.  Every member state is entitled to its domestic policies within the European Union framework.  I am also not necessarily sure it would lead to the kind of efficiencies the Deputy has suggested.  Neither system is perfect, whether a completely market-led approach or a hybrid approach involving State involvement regulated by regulators along with other actors and players in the marketplace.  We need a strong regulatory framework with strong capacity.  That is what we support.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Bacik's point regarding the other resettlement programmes, without question, the Ukrainian situation has put great pressure on our system.  Some 50,000 have come into the country, of whom approximately 38,000 or 39,000 are housed by the State through premises that have been procured such as hotels while others have been housed through the housing provided voluntarily by people.  There has also been growth in the normal asylum seeking process.  There are also programmes for those fleeing war, specifically Afghans and Syrians.  I will check on these programmes.  I have not been alerted that they are under pressure.  There are other newer arrivals, not all of whom are fleeing war.  This is also putting pressure on the accommodation situation.<\/p>  <p>  I have already referenced the Corrib gas field, which has been of enormous importance in supplying Ireland.  We have not had much success with fossil fuel extraction in Ireland.  The Kinsale gas field was the original and the Corrib gas field has been a very important contributor.  We import most of our gas.  We are very dependent on importation.  Again, the EU instrument will cover both.  We are supporting that.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe that same point covers what Deputy Martin Kenny referenced with regard to the emergency meeting in Brussels.  There is to be another meeting and the Commission will publish a proposal with a view to reaching a decision at a meeting of energy ministers on 30 September.  Apart from that, the Government will have to help alleviate pressures on people and protect jobs in the weeks immediately ahead of us through the budget and associated cost-of-living package using our own resources and surplus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400024#W00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663170900,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir teacht ar Cheisteanna Scr&iacute;ofa ar www.oireachtas.ie.<br \/><br \/>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Commission of Investigation Report: Statements","time":1663170900,"counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400024#W00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1663170900,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the report of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, commission of investigation on the Siteserv transaction today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400024#W00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1663170900,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Is there a copy of the speech available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400024#W00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1663170900,"counter":320,"content":"<p>There may not be.  I will have to try to secure a copy.  I apologise.  It is important to debate the contents of this report in the D&aacute;il for two reasons.  The first is that the commission was established as a result of issues raised on the floor of the House and its terms of reference were the subject of extensive discussions between all parties in the Oireachtas both at the outset and during the lifetime of the commission.  The second is that the commission has made very serious findings, which are of great concern, with regard to the behaviour of some parties during the course of the Siteserv transaction with consequent implications for both our taxpayers and the reputation of Ireland's corporate sector.  While we all might share some frustrations at the length and cost of the commission's work, to which I will return, it is important to state at the outset that this has been a worthwhile exercise.  What the commission discovered and has reported shines a light on completely unacceptable practices and vindicates the effort that has gone into it.  I thank Mr. Justice Brian Cregan, the sole member of the commission, for his comprehensive and detailed report.  Before discussing the report, I also want to confirm that while, as Taoiseach, I am responsible for certain administrative functions in relation to the commission, the commission is entirely independent in all respects of its work.<\/p><p>Deputies will recall that the commission was established by the Government in June 2015 following approval of a draft order by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Deputies may also recall that the commission submitted an interim report in November 2015 which raised significant issues regarding legal professional privilege, banking confidentiality and its terms of reference.  As a result, following consultations with all Oireachtas parties, bespoke legislation was enacted in 2017 to provide a new legal basis for the commission.  <\/p><p>The commission's terms of reference were also amended following consultations between Oireachtas parties.  Under these amended terms of reference, the commission was required to investigate all transactions, activities and management decisions at the IBRC, other than those relating solely to the acquisition of assets by the National Asset Management Agency, which occurred between 21 January 2009 and 7 February 2013 and which either resulted in a capital loss to the IBRC of at least &euro;10 million or are specifically identified by the commission as giving rise or likely to give rise to potential public concern in respect of the ultimate returns to the taxpayer.  The commission had established that 38 transactions came within these terms of reference and, in its first module, it was charged with investigating the Siteserv transaction, which had been identified by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a matter of significant public concern.  The commission was also charged with, in the first module of its work, reviewing and reporting on the principles and policies within the IBRC in respect of the setting of interest rates generally during the relevant period.<\/p><p>The commission's terms of reference also extend to investigating: matters relating to the processes, procedures and controls which were operated by the IBRC; whether there is <i>prima facie<\/i>evidence of material deficiencies in the performance of their functions by those acting on behalf of the IBRC, including the IBRC board, directors, management, the staff of the wealth management unit and agents; whether it can be concluded that the transactions were not commercially sound; whether any unusual share trading occurred; and whether the Minister for Finance or his Department was kept informed, where appropriate, in respect of the transactions concerned and whether he, or officials on his behalf, took appropriate steps in respect of the information provided to them.<\/p><p>My Department received the report on the Siteserv transaction on 29 July and it was published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 7 September 2022 following consultation with the Attorney General.  The commission's report is more than 1,500 pages long, goes through all aspects of the Siteserv transaction in an extraordinary level of detail and makes extensive findings of fact.  The Government has noted the findings of the commission with considerable concern.  The commission has determined that it can be concluded that the bank made its decision to approve the sale of the Siteserv Group in good faith but based on misleading and incomplete information provided to it by the company.<\/p><p>The commission found there were two parallel processes during the sale process.  The first was the &quot;above the surface&quot; sale process organised by Siteserv and its advisers, in which the company chose bidders, evaluated the bids, decided to grant exclusivity to Mr. O'Brien's company's bid and then signed and completed the sale to Mr. O'Brien's company.<\/p> <p>Second was the so-called \"below the surface\" process, where certain events occurred in the course of the Siteserv sale process without the knowledge of the bank.  This \"below the surface\" process meant steps were taken and decisions made in the course of the Siteserv sale process in a manner that was clearly and manifestly improper and undermined the integrity of the Siteserv sale process.<\/p> <p> The commission has also determined that it can be concluded the Siteserv transaction was, from the perspective of the bank, so tainted by impropriety and wrongdoing that the transaction was not commercially sound.  It states that the bank might, subject to certain assumptions, have recovered up to &euro;8.7 million more than the &euro;44.3 million it agreed to accept in the sale.  Of course, this is not the only loss to the taxpayer.  The very significant costs arising from the commission are also as a result of this impropriety and wrongdoing.<\/p> <p> It is also worth putting on the record that some of the allegations made in this House and elsewhere were not upheld by the commission.  Many aspects of this transaction, and the behaviour of most parties, including IBRC itself, were appropriate, and this should not be lost in commentary either.  The commission found that the procedures and controls that were operated by IBRC at the relevant time in relation to the Siteserv transaction were fit for purpose.  The commission found there is no evidence that any unusual trading in Siteserv shares occurred.  The commission established the approach taken by the IBRC in relation to the setting of interest rates for individual loans, and how those decisions were reached, and made no adverse findings.  I would also like to take the opportunity to place on the record that the commission found there was nothing inappropriate in me, as then Leader of the Opposition, in meeting with Mr. Neil Ryan, then of the Department of Finance, in 2015.  It also found Mr. Ryan did not disclose any information gained in the course of his official work to me.<\/p> <p> While it is important not to prejudge the outcome of follow-up investigations, people should clearly be held responsible for any breaches of the law.  In this regard, the commission recommended the report be brought to the attention of relevant authorities concerning a number of taxation, company law and bankruptcy issues.  Accordingly, as per the commission's recommendations and on foot of advice from the Attorney General, I have arranged for the report to be brought to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, the special liquidators of IBRC, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, the Central Bank and the official assignee in a bankruptcy case.  These bodies are now responsible for conducting any appropriate investigations on foot of the report.<\/p> <p> The commission is currently preparing a report with its recommendations on the investigation of the other 37 transactions that fall to be considered as part of its work.  It is required to submit this report before the end of October 2022.  Upon receipt of this report, the Government will make a decision on the future of the commission.  However, the commission has previously indicated there will be significant, if not insuperable, difficulties in progressing the investigation into the other 37 transactions.  This is because, for example, many of the companies involved are located outside the jurisdiction of the State or no longer exist as they have been dissolved or gone into receivership.  In making that decision, the Government will also be cognisant of the time and cost of the commission to date.<\/p> <p> In fact, the length of time this commission has taken to complete the report on the Siteserv transaction raises broader questions about the effectiveness of the commissions of investigation model.  When the Commissions of Investigation Act was enacted in 2004, it was hoped it would enable quick and cost-effective investigation of matters of significant public concern.  However, it is now more than seven years since the IBRC commission was established.  In that time the estimated cost has been around &euro;12 million.  This does not include third-party legal costs that have been incurred but not yet paid and which are a matter for the commission to determine.  The commission also acknowledged that it involved a substantial degree of uncertainty regarding the amount of costs actually recoverable by the parties before it and assumed its legal costs guidelines are not successfully challenged.  The final cost will only be known when the commission makes its determinations on third-party costs.  The cost is clearly going to be too high in any case.<\/p> <p> In light of the length of time that has elapsed since the commission was established and the level of costs arising, I suggest the Oireachtas might wish to consider whether we can do anything to improve the regulatory framework for statutory investigations.  Of course, in saying this we need to tread carefully because commissions must be independent in their investigations and must adhere to fair procedures and natural justice.  It must also be borne in mind that some commissions of investigation have been able to complete their investigations in a quicker and more cost-effective manner.  However, the broad range of investigations completed to date under the commissions of investigation model might suggest the model is not entirely or equally suitable for all types of investigations.  For example, it may be that using this model for investigations into complex corporate transactions is not as suitable as using it for issues related to public administration, where it is possible to confirm facts more easily.  There are broader questions about the cost and efficiency of our legal system more generally, which remain a matter of concern to the economy and society.  We also need to examine the role and effectiveness of the permanent regulatory and investigatory framework.<\/p> <p> The Government is open to ideas from other Oireachtas parties on these issues because, clearly, our ultimate objective is to ensure that, as far as possible, we have a regulatory framework that promotes and ensures a culture of compliance and good ethical standards in matters of both public and corporate affairs.  Indeed, pursuit of this objective has been a core value of this Government since coming into office.  To date, we have made significant progress with initiatives to combat corruption and white-collar crime.  For example, earlier this year we established the Corporate Enforcement Authority, which will have the autonomy and resources to investigate suspected wrongdoing thoroughly.  We are increasing staffing levels by nearly 50%, including doubling the number of garda&iacute;, and the authority's budget has also been increased by almost 30%.<\/p> <p> An all-of-government implementation plan to progress the recommendations in the Hamilton review into economic crime was published in April 2021.  This sets out 22 actions to enhance enforcement and prevention capacity in the criminal justice sphere.  Five actions have already been completed in full, and a number of others have been significantly advanced.  For example, the Criminal Procedure Bill has been enacted, the Judicial Council has been engaged with in relation to the development of judicial training in respect of complex economic crime or corruption cases, a forum of senior representatives from the relevant operational bodies was established in June 2021, and the Competition (Amendment) Act was signed into law on 29 June.  There has also been significant progress to implement other recommendations, including greater powers for investigating agencies to tackle economic crime and corruption; the establishment of an advisory council against economic crime and corruption; reform of the ethics Acts; and additional resourcing for enforcement agencies.<\/p> <p> The commission's report has highlighted improper, wrong and unacceptable behaviour on the part of some in the Siteserv transaction.  It is right and important the impropriety and wrongdoing in this process has been brought to public attention.  It is right and important the relevant statutory bodies will now have the opportunity to investigate this impropriety and wrongdoing and take the action deemed appropriate.  This experience raises a question mark for us as a Legislature over what we might do to make any future such investigation more timely and less expensive, but critically, it also demonstrates the need for us to keep refining and improving the regulatory framework, and indeed the culture in corporate and public affairs in our country, to prevent the need for future investigations of this nature in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400024#W00600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663171500,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an deis a bheith &aacute;balta labhairt inniu ar an tuairisc seo agus an fiosr&uacute;ch&aacute;n at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh anois le blianta fada &oacute; thaobh an d&iacute;olach&aacute;n de Siteserv a tharlaigh in 2012.

This report has had a long gestation.  Before making a number of comments and observations regarding the findings of the commission, it is worth recalling the very reason this commission was established and this investigation was carried out, so long has it been.  Back in 2012, households, businesses and the taxpayer were all still reeling from the effects of the financial crash.  Many banks were still trying to recover as much money as they could.  One such bank was IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank, which was then State-owned following a &euro;34 billion bailout from the taxpayer in 2009.<\/p> <p>Three years later, in 2012, Siteserv, then a business services company group, was under significant financial strain and owed IBRC, and ultimately the Irish taxpayer, &euro;162.2 million.  It was in 2012 that Siteserv was sold at a price of &euro;45.4 million euros to Cathkin Investments Limited, or Millington.  Following the sale, Siteserv paid &euro;44.3 million as a final settlement of its debts with IBRC, with IBRC writing off &euro;118 million of the &euro;162 million that had been owed to the bank by Siteserv.<br\/><br\/>This transaction was of interest to the public and to the taxpayer for a number of reasons.  First, it emerged there were other companies, such as Altrad and Anchorage, that had made bids for Siteserv, with claims made that Anchorage had even made a higher bid than Millington but the bid had not been accepted.  This led to justifiable concerns regarding whether IBRC could have recouped more money on behalf of the taxpayer and whether Siteserv had been undervalued as a result.  This question was of crucial importance.  This was not simply a normal commercial transaction but one in which the interests of the taxpayer were involved.  This led to further concerns regarding the management of the sales process, whether favourable treatment had been conferred on Millington and its owners, and why higher bids were rejected if they had been made.<br\/><br\/>Second, it later emerged that, following the transaction, Siteserv shareholders would be paid &euro;5 million.  This was highly unusual given that, in the normal course of events when a bank is writing off unpaid obligations, shareholders are never in such a position.  This raised further questions regarding the propriety of the transaction and the entire process surrounding it.  These questions were reasonable, given the revelations that had emerged, and it was in the public interest that answers be sought.  In June 2015, the commission of investigation was established following an order under the Commissions of Investigation Act.  The following month, Mr. Justice Brian Cregan was appointed to lead the commission.  It should also be noted that, under the legislation, the commission is not only tasked with investigating the Siteserv transaction, but any transactions in which Anglo Irish Bank wrote off &euro;10 million or more.  There were 38 such transactions, and a key question following this report into one of these transactions is the future of the commission.  I will come to that at the end of my contribution.<br\/><br\/>I wish to comment on a number of the findings and conclusions made by the commission in the report.  The first point to note is that the commission has determined, &quot;It can be concluded that the Bank made its decision to approve the sale of the Siteserv Group to Mr O'Brien in good faith, but based on misleading and incomplete information provided to it by the Company.&quot;  The conclusions with respect to the actions of Siteserv are very different, with the commission finding that the decision by Siteserv to offer Millington and its owner exclusivity on the deal was &quot;so tainted by impropriety and ... wrongdoing&quot; that, from the perspective of the bank, the transaction was not commercially sound.  In this regard, the commission also found that the manner in which the transaction was conducted, the decisions and actions taken in the course of the transaction, and its outcome were all unreasonable from the perspective of the bank and, therefore, the taxpayer.<br\/><br\/>The commission further found the decision made by Siteserv to grant exclusivity to Millington and its owner was a decision made &quot;without even considering whether to contact Anchorage, the other leading bidder&quot; before exclusivity was granted to Millington and its owner.  Further, the commission found this decision favoured Millington and its owner by conferring a &quot;significant advantage over other bidders in seeking to acquire the Siteserv Group&quot;.  As a result, the report found that by failing, or even refusing, to consider the offer that had been made by Anchorage, Siteserv had shut out IBRC from considering the offer.  Given the &euro;162 million owed by Siteserv to IBRC at the time, this failure to consider and disclose the Anchorage offer was totally improper.<br\/><br\/>The commission also found that, throughout the Siteserv sale process, two parallel processes were at play, as the Taoiseach mentioned.  One was above the surface, seemingly conducted by the company in plain view.  The other was below the surface, in the shadows, carried out without the knowledge of IBRC.  The report states, &quot;This &quot;<i>below the surface<\/i>&quot; process meant that steps were taken and decisions made ... in the course of the Siteserv sale process in a manner that was manifestly improper and which undermined the integrity of the Siteserv sale process.&quot;<br\/><br\/>The report of the commission also made findings with respect to those in Siteserv most intimately involved in the transaction, and I will take a few moments to put some of those findings on the D&aacute;il record.  In March 2012, I asked the then Minister for Finance a question, which is on the D&aacute;il record, about why IBRC had agreed to write down the value of its loans to Siteserv by more than &euro;100 million, while at the same time shareholders of the company were paid &euro;5 million as part of the deal, with a further question posed the following month.  It was the first time it was raised in this House.  The report we now have reveals that these questions led to a series of communications between the Department of Finance and IBRC, and led to meetings in the upper echelons of IBRC.  IBRC then sought information from Siteserv, KPMG and Davy.<br\/><br\/>In August 2013, I made a freedom of information request for all copies of all Anglo Irish Bank's board papers that had been sent to the Department and the Central Bank in the relevant period.  The report finds that IBRC did not furnish the Department with all of the relevant documentation.  With respect to the payment that was made to shareholders as part of the Siteserv transaction, the commission has found that the credit committee at IBRC failed to pursue its own request for further information on the &euro;5 million payment and approved the transaction without that information.  The report concludes that failure contributed to IBRC recovering up to &euro;2.1 million less from the proceeds of the Siteserv sale, a failure that, ultimately, undermined the interests of the taxpayer.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Dix was a director of the company and served as chair of Siteserv's sale committee.  The report found he played a crucial role in the decision to grant exclusivity to Millington and its owner.  The report found the decision conferred significant advantage to Millington above other potential bidders.  In addition, the report reached the damning conclusion that &quot;Mr Dix gave false, misleading and untruthful evidence in his sworn affidavits to the Commission&quot; regarding his skiing and fitness bootcamp trip with the owner of Millington, Mr. O'Brien, in St. Moritz, Switzerland.  His attendance at this so-called bootcamp with the owner of Millington was not disclosed to the board of Siteserv, its sale subcommittee, its company advisers or the bank.  The report further found that this non-disclosure was not accidental but was deliberate.  The commission reached the reasonable conclusion that if the relationship between Mr. Dix and the owner of Millington had been known at the time, including the fact they spent a weekend together on a skiing and fitness bootcamp in the Swiss Alps, it would have &quot;given rise to a perception on the part of a reasonable, objective person that Mr Dix was not impartial in his role as chairman of the Sale Sub-Committee&quot;.<br\/><br\/>At the time of the Siteserv-Millington transaction, Mr. Harvey was CEO of the company.  The report reaches no less damning conclusions about him.  The relevant section of the report in this regard states the commission found that although Mr. Harvey attended a Siteserv board meeting on 4 March 2012 and voted to approve the sale of Siteserv Group to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, &quot;he concealed from the Board the fact that he had a significant financial interest in Mr O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s bid succeeding&quot;.  Those are the words of this report.  The report continues, &quot;He also concealed from the Board that Mr McFadden was arranging a plan whereby Mr Harvey would purportedly not have to pay tax on his Siteserv bonus.&quot;  It later states that those were clearly material interests to be disclosed to the board and yet Mr Harvey failed to do so.  These findings are damning and reveal a corporate culture that rode roughshod over the principles of openness.<br\/><br\/>With respect to Mr. McFadden, who was cofounder of Siteserv, the report makes damning findings that must now be investigated by Revenue as a matter of urgency.  These findings are shocking and reveal the disregard which some in high places have for the requirements which ordinary citizens abide by every day.  The commission found that Mr. McFadden set out to put forward two scenarios.  One scenario is described as a story and the other is described as the reality.  These scenarios were to ensure the &euro;350,000 bonus to be paid to Siteserv&rsquo;s CEO would not be declared to Revenue.  On the afternoon that IBRC was to clear the sale of Siteserv to Millington and Siteserv was to approve the sale, Mr. McFadden met with the owner of Millington&rsquo;s adviser beforehand to finalise a plan through which Mr. Harvey and Mr. McFadden would take shareholdings in the company that bought Siteserv.<\/p> <p>Through a chain of emails, Mr. McFadden set out these two scenarios.  Its purpose was to set out the money that would be given to Mr. Harvey from a Siteserv bonus and the proceeds of the Siteserv shares, and the money he would need to repay the &euro;1.7 million debt to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC and to buy shares in the company that would acquire Siteserv.  The story Mr. McFadden told was that Mr. Harvey would pay income tax and PRSI on his expected bonus.  The reality Mr. McFadden described was that Mr. Harvey would waive his bonus, never pay tax on it, and still receive the full amount.<br\/><br\/>Although the commission found that Mr. Harvey did not waive the bonus, a scheme was established whereby the new company took on the obligation to pay the bonus, which was then bartered for shares in such a way that &ldquo;no tax was ever paid on this bonus or on this grant of shares&rdquo;, to quote the commission's report.  The report goes on to say: &ldquo;It is clear from the <i>&quot;story\/reality&quot; <\/i>document that was sent by Mr McFadden ... that [he] constructed a scheme that was designed, from start to finish, not to disclose Mr Harvey&rsquo;s bonus to the Revenue Commissioners at any time.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>The findings of the report are shocking, and lift a veil on the reckless and elitist culture that infected certain echelons of Irish business and high finance during a dark chapter in our State&rsquo;s history, especially when it concerns a bank that the taxpayer had bailed out at huge economic and social cost.  It is clear that there were those to whom the ordinary rules that bind ordinary citizens were seen not to apply.<br\/><br\/>The findings of the report also reveal the sad fact that has bedevilled the State and its citizens for far too long.  This is a small place, with a small population, in which those with power and money often swim in the same circles, rub shoulders and even go skiing together in the Swiss Alps.  This leaves open the possibility and perception of impropriety or even corruption.  I am extremely concerned at the reckless disregard with which highly confidential information passed hands without authorisation before making its way to those who had an interest in accessing it.<br\/><br\/>We know that the revolving door between the corporate world and the State is one that opens at times when it should in fact be closed.  In my opinion, we still do not have robust enough safeguards in place to ensure that individuals do not move freely and with ease between the corridors of corporate Ireland and the corridors of power.  It exposes our State to undue risks and casts doubts over the State&rsquo;s ability to act independently on behalf of its citizens.<br\/><br\/>The report of the commission of investigation on the Siteserv transaction runs into thousands of pages, and D&aacute;il time does not allow for an exhaustive consideration of all of its findings.  We have, however, come to the end of a seven-year process, one that will cost more than the &euro;30 million that had been previously anticipated.  I am aware that under the commission&rsquo;s remit, there are another 37 transactions with respect to IBRC that could be investigated.  We now need to take stock of this process and whether it is fit for purpose, whether it delivers value for money for the taxpayer and whether it acts as an incentive or disincentive for further corporate malpractice.<br\/><br\/>That reaching findings regarding the propriety or impropriety of a commercial transaction and the actions of those involved should depend on a process that has proved costly and slow cannot be the model we pursue.  Ensuring our corporate enforcement procedures are fit for purpose is essential to ensuring that we can deter malpractice and wrongdoing.  It is important that, following this report by the commission of investigation, the Government charts a path forward, one that sees us get to a point a lot more quickly, with less costs involved, but which gets to the truth in a fair and transparent way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400025#X00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663172700,"counter":325,"content":"<p>The Siteserv report brings us back to the year 2007 and to the calamitous events that unfolded in this country and across the world, events from which we, arguably, have yet to recover.  We are still dealing with the fallout.  It was in June of that year that Bear Stearns bailed out two of its hedge funds with $20 billion of exposure to collateralise debt obligations as sub-prime mortgages.  At that stage Bear Stearns famously said that the problem was \"contained\".  As we know, it later had to be bailed out by the Federal Reserve Board.  It was in August 2007 that BNP Paribas blocked withdrawals from three of its hedge funds, with a total of $2.2 billion in assets under management, due to what they termed \"a complete evaporation of liquidity\".  In September 2007 Northern Rock had to receive support from the Bank of England, which led to investor panic and a bank run, and to Northern Rock's subsequent nationalisation.<\/p>  <p>  At precisely the same time that Anglo Irish Bank lent &euro;156.4 million, in tranches over just seven months, to Siteserv to refinance its existing borrowings and to provide debt financing for acquisitions, it became the sole lender to Siteserv.  Anglo Irish Bank collapsed and Siteserv was seriously overborrowed.  In fact, its debts exceeded the value of its business.  Meanwhile, Siteserv's CEO, Mr. Harvey, personally owed Anglo &euro;1.7 million.  Its co-founder, Mr. McFadden, who became a Siteserv consultant, was also a significant borrower from Anglo.  He was at the receiving end of a &euro;15 million judgment from Anglo in 2009.<\/p>  <p>  Although the specifics of some certain allegations of themselves may not have necessarily stood up, the Cregan report did uncover a series of undisclosed meetings and communications with Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s company Island Capital in relation to &ldquo;management incentivisation arrangements&rdquo; for Mr. Harvey and Mr. McFadden.  This was despite the fact that Island Capital and Siteserv had entered into a confidentiality agreement under which Island Capital had agreed not to contact any Siteserv officers or employees without prior consent.<\/p>  <p>  The report also discloses that Mr. Robert Dix, a Siteserv non-executive director and its senior independent director, at a crucial stage in the Siteserv sale process when second round bids were due to be submitted, travelled to St. Moritz - as we know - with Mr. McFadden to spend a week with Mr. Denis O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. McFadden on a skiing holiday.  On this holiday Mr. McFadden and Mr. O&rsquo;Brien discussed the amount of shares that Mr. McFadden and Mr. Harvey could acquire in Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s new company if Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s bid was successful, and they agreed a figure of 15%.  As we know, Mr. Harvey later voted in favour of the grant of exclusivity to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien in his capacity as a Siteserv director without disclosing his agreement in principle to acquire a shareholding in the new company and thus that he had a significant financial interest in Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s bid succeeding.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Dix chaired the Siteserv sale sub-committee meeting assessing all the bids, without ever disclosing his holiday with the successful bidder to either the committee or the board.  The report arrives at a judgment that one can reasonably disagree with.  On the one hand, it concludes that Mr. Dix&rsquo;s relationship with Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, his friendship with Mr. McFadden and his holiday with them both, &ldquo;would, if known at the time, have given rise to a perception on the part of a reasonable, objective person that Mr Dix was not impartial in his role as chairman of the Sale Sub-Committee&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, the report states that Mr. O&rsquo;Brien was not at fault in going on this holiday with Mr. Dix and Mr. McFadden, or in relation to any of the other improprieties uncovered.  It is perhaps a testament to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s ethical and moral standing that he can continue to behave seemingly entirely without fault even while all around him, for some strange reason, his associates and colleagues are behaving quite improperly.<\/p>  <p>  Judge Cregan found that not only did Mr. Dix&rsquo;s behaviour give rise to a perception of a lack of impartiality but that Mr. Dix &ldquo;did not act in an impartial manner in his role as Chairman of the Sale Sub-Committee, but instead acted in a manner that improperly favoured Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s bid&rdquo;.  In particular, he found that Siteserv&rsquo;s decision after two rounds of bids to grant exclusivity to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien was, from the perspective of the bank, not reasonable and was tainted by impropriety.  It is worthwhile listing why.  Mr. Dix did not disclose to Siteserv or its advisers or the bank his relationship with Mr. O&rsquo;Brien; his relationship with Mr. McFadden; Mr. McFadden&rsquo;s role in advising-assisting Mr. O&rsquo;Brien in relation to his bid; that Mr. McFadden would benefit financially if Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s bid were successful; and his holiday with Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. McFadden at a key time in the transaction.  The decision to grant exclusivity to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien was, coincidentally, made just four days after Mr. Dix had returned from his holiday with Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. McFadden.<\/p> <p>That decision was one of the most important made in the course of the Siteserv transaction.<br\/><br\/>As chairman of the sale subcommittee and as director with primary responsibility for execution of the Siteserv transaction, Mr. Dix played a vital role in the decision to grant exclusivity to Mr. O'Brien.  The exclusivity decision favoured Mr. O'Brien as it conferred on him a significant advantage over other bidders.  Mr. Dix thus acted in a manner that favoured Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, and did so while not disclosing any of these matters.<br\/><br\/>Meanwhile, Mr. Harvey concealed from Siteserv, its advisers and the bank that he had a significant financial interest in Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s bid.  Mr. Harvey also concealed from them the fact he had passed on confidential information about the sale process.  Mr. Harvey did not disclose to them that Mr. McFadden had a role in advising and assisting Mr. O&rsquo;Brien in his bid, nor did he disclose to them that Mr. McFadden would also obtain shares in Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s new company if Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s bid were successful.<br\/><br\/>However, above and beyond the ins and outs of this striking narrative, the stark fact is it involves large sums of money that are nonetheless dwarfed by the cost of the commission itself.  Under the Commissions of Investigation Act, none of the oral evidence gathered by Mr. Justice Cregan is admissible in any civil or criminal court proceedings.  The <i>quid pro quo<\/i>is that the judge can arrive at the truth effectively and expeditiously.  Clearly, this has not happened.  Instead, reading the report is like examining a long-buried time capsule that includes a story from long ago.<br\/><br\/>These investigations do not serve a useful purpose if they cannot be completed in a reasonable time frame and as expeditiously as possible.  There can certainly be no question of any further modules along these lines.There are doubts whether any further modules on these lines can occur and they cannot take place unless and until we know what went wrong in the management of this commission.  Was it the legislation, the terms of reference, or some other factor?  We need to learn from our mistakes instead of repeating them.  We need to figure out how we can undertake examinations of issues of public importance in a much more timely and expeditious way.  Clearly, the system we have is not serving the public interest given how long this inquiry took.  There are other modules on the agenda.<br\/><br\/>Let us recall how an attempt was made to try to empower the Houses of the Oireachtas to carry out certain kinds of inquires almost ten years ago and the decision was taken by the people.  Should we, as part of the Oireachtas, consider better ways of examining matters of public interest than the legislation, the 2004 Act, that was used for this?  It is something this House and the committees could usefully examine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400027#Z00200","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663173300,"counter":327,"content":"<p>We now go to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Calleary.

I thank you for your good wishes.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the commission of inquiry shine a light on very unacceptable practices by certain parties during the course of the Siteserv transaction.  The commission&rsquo;s report reminds us we must be ever vigilant in ensuring our laws are upheld.  One purpose of company law is to facilitate entrepreneurial activity.  It does so by providing for separate corporate legal personality and limited liability, thereby limiting personal exposure to financial risk.  In return for these privileges, and privileges they are, company law sets down a framework within which companies and their directors are expected to operate.  Certain reporting and transparency requirements must be complied with; certain protections are afforded to shareholders, creditors and the wider public; and sanctions, civil and criminal, are provided for in respect of certain non-compliance.<\/p>  <p>  The law demands that in return for the privilege of limited liability, those availing of it act in good faith and abide by minimum requirements of governance, transparency and commercial probity.  Companies are governed and managed by individuals.  Most company directors want to do, and indeed do, the right thing.  They act in accordance with the law.  In the event of non-compliance, investigation and enforcement and individual accountability are important.<\/p>  <p>  As I have recently assumed office as Minister of State with responsibility for company regulation, I want to reiterate that the unacceptable practices by certain parties as described in this report are very concerning.  I welcome the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, especially those which prompt further consideration by public bodies with enforcement functions including, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, which falls under my responsibility.  The commission recommends that the CEA should investigate the matters set out in chapter 17 of the report relating to shareholdings.  There is also a recommendation that the CEA and the Revenue Commissioners investigate matters set out in part 1 of chapter 26 relating to a &euro;780,000 loan scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have already sent the CEA the commission&rsquo;s report.  Deputies will appreciate that, by law, the CEA is independent in its functions, but I have no doubt whatever the CEA will very carefully consider the report and its findings and assess what further actions may be appropriate for the authority to pursue.  While there are no findings or recommendations arising in respect of my Department, officials in my Department will also consider the report in the context of any possible wider implications for company law.<\/p>  <p>  It has long been justifiably argued that Ireland must maintain a conducive environment for enterprise to develop and grow, leading to increased levels and quality of jobs, which in turn provide for higher standards of living.  A vital component of a conducive environment is business regulation.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for a range of independent bodies that have important roles in respect of business oversight, supervision, regulation, protection and enforcement.  Such bodies include the Corporate Enforcement Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, and the Companies Registration Office, under which are the Registry of Friendly Societies and the Registrar of Beneficial Ownership.  These bodies, along with others, provide the framework on which businesses operate and can rely upon to ensure there are clear rules for business that protect all in the value chain, from consumers to suppliers, that there are registration and governance requirements that provide transparency for stakeholders, including investors, and so on.<\/p>  <p>  A key focus of my new role will be to support a strengthening of the regulatory bodies under my remit, especially those commonly regarded as watchdogs, in light of the growing economy and the additional functions ascribed to them over the past two years.  First and most important in respect of the matter we are debating, the recent establishment of the new Corporate Enforcement Authority is intended to ensure consumers and businesses have confidence that alleged breaches of company law will be effectively investigated and prosecuted.  A well-resourced authority with effective enforcement tools at its disposal will meet the challenges it faces in its investigation and prosecution of alleged breaches of company law.  The total increase in the overall headcount for the new CEA will be nearly 50% over previous levels, and the number of Garda assigned to the CEA is doubling.  The authority is equipped with significant enforcement powers, including prosecuting detected breaches of the Companies Act 2014 and referring cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution on indictment.  I believe company law should always be responsive to new developments.  My Department will continue to work with the new authority to ensure it has the appropriate legislative tools necessary to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s company law framework and to undertake modern, complex corporate law enforcement<\/p>  <p>  I want to recount the broader reforms the Government has made and those planned, all of which have at their heart a rebalancing of the rights and obligations of companies and their stakeholders.  We took into account the distinctive challenges facing our small companies by introducing a dedicated rescue process for small and micro companies, the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, which came into effect in December 2021.<\/p> <p>We have also reformed our examinership laws under the European Union regulations to help bring about a pan-EU regime for helping companies in difficulty while ensuring their creditors have rights.  The Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Act 2021 also reflects our reform philosophy in striking a new balance for consumers.  The Competition (Amendment) Act earlier this year enables the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to crackdown on rogue operators.  Cartels where they exist will be broken up and companies abusing a dominant position will be punished with heavy fines of up to 10% of global turnover.<\/p> <p> I am determined that the ambitious agenda of reform to strengthen our enterprise regulatory enforcement bodies undertaken by my predecessor, Deputy Robert Troy, will continue.  I wish to acknowledge the great work that he put in in this area.  I will shortly bring to the Seanad the Consumer Rights Bill which represents the biggest overhaul of consumer rights in nearly 40 years.  This new law is good for consumers and good for business.  Most businesses are responsible and treat their customers fairly when things go wrong.  For those that do not, it can give them an unfair advantage over their competitors.  This new law consolidates legislation and updates it to make it fit for the modern digital age.  Within the next few months, I will also publish new laws to permit for the first time a third party to represent a group of harmed consumers.  This is an important development to improve consumers' access to justice.<\/p> <p> I will shortly introduce legislation to enhance and reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, providing it with new functions and improving the legislation to make the PIAB process more effective.  Officials in my Department are developing new legislation to reform our limited partnership laws as well as business name laws.  I expect to bring to Government shortly a general scheme of a Bill to reform laws on co-operative societies and encourage their development.  All this work is designed to ensure our body of legislation is fit for purpose in the 21st century and our regulatory bodies are equipped to undertake their important statutory functions.<\/p> <p> The report we are debating today goes through all aspects of the Siteserv transaction in an extraordinary level of detail and makes extensive findings of fact.  Government accepts the findings of the commission.  It is clear that there were unacceptable practices by certain parties during the course of that transaction.  As the Taoiseach said, he is bringing the relevant recommendations of the commission to the attention of the relevant authorities as appropriate.  I have no doubt that these bodies will carefully consider the report and in line with their statutory role take the appropriate action where considered necessary.<\/p> <p> Despite the unacceptable behaviour of a minority, the vast majority of businesses in Ireland do not engage in such practices.  We have a valuable reputation as a good place to do business overseen by effective laws and regulatory bodies.  This has been hard won and must be maintained.  White-collar crime damages our economy, breeds cynicism in our society and is a threat to our domestic and our international reputation.  It cannot and will not be tolerated.<\/p> <p> As the new Minister of State with responsibility for trade promotion, digital and company regulation I will work to continue to ensure that the framework on which businesses operate is built on clear rules for business which provide transparency and protection for stakeholders, employees and consumers.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that a number of Deputies and their staff were involved in this process from the start and took considerable personal courage to pursue the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400028#AA00300","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663173900,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State on his promotion.<\/p><p>I welcome some of what he has said on the Corporate Enforcement Authority.  If ever there was a place that needed such an entity to be fit for purpose it is obviously this State.  Unfortunately, as we get a lesson about 2012, it is a further reminder of the perception of the connectivity certain people have.  There are relationships that exist.  People have trips and holidays together and have conversations, meaning that at times things can be arranged no matter what the paperwork actually shows at the end.<\/p><p>Anyway, we are dealing with the Siteserv transaction.  People have spoken about unacceptable behaviour tainted by impropriety.  That is the biggest issue.  I do not know what term to use.  The Minister of State spoke about underplaying.  It goes without saying that it is absolutely underplaying given the circumstances we are dealing with.<\/p><p>A number of Deputies have gone through the ins and outs of this.  Siteserv was founded in 2004 by Mr. Harvey and Mr. McFadden.  By 2008, it owed Anglo Irish Bank &euro;155 million.  We know the whole sordid history relating to Anglo Irish Bank and the bailout of approximately &euro;36.4 billion.  We know that in 2008 Mr. McFadden had borrowings of &euro;7 billion with the bank and had signed personal guarantees up to &euro;74 million.  He seemed to be on the road to bankruptcy.  We know there was a very close relationship between Mr. McFadden and Mr. Harvey.  We now know of the relationship with Mr. O'Brien.  We know of Mr. Robert Dix's involvement with this.  It is fair to say they all knew each other very well and that seemed to work out reasonably well for people.<\/p><p>People probably find it difficult to understand given the relationship and the money owed that Mr. McFadden was on contract with Siteserv to find buyers, arrange for sales and all the rest of it.  Some of this report makes for very interesting reading and we know that whatever happened from September 2011 until the close of this deal, the fact is that there was an enormous write-off of &euro;118 million of the money owed by Siteserv to IBRC, which had previously been Anglo Irish Bank.  The sale went through to, I believe, Millington for &euro;444.3 million.  This whole thing was started on the basis of another company stating it would have paid more and all the rest of it.<\/p><p>I agree with some of the previous speakers who said that at this point in time or at least when the commission prepared this report, we did not have the wherewithal to deal with the whole issue of corporate enforcement.  I would love to see the relevant authorities in place and taking action.  If we have anomalies or missing parts, be they legislative or whatever else, we need to make it happen.  We know the pain people went through at the time of the economic collapse, which is again on our minds with what we are facing now.  We need to ensure that we have the wherewithal to deal with all this.<\/p><p>We are dealing with the issue of financial impropriety in the case of Siteserv.  We are talking about a time when people were going through austerity.  As the Minister of State is in front of me, I wish to speak about a company that is suffering real difficulties.  I refer to Suretank in Dunleer.  A representative of that company spoke on LMFM radio of this morning.  I spoke to Martin Winters myself.  There were other businesses such as McGeough's, Rocksalt in Dundalk and also Anglo Printers in Drogheda.  I would like a bit of leeway to read out a couple of lines:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have been informed our electricity bill which was &euro;15,000 will increase to &euro;50,500 with effect from October 1st 2022.

In 2012, the troika was still in town; the austerity programme was under way; the national debt had ballooned; new taxes such as the universal social charge, USC, were introduced; some people lost their homes and businesses and there was a lot of fear and distress.  IBRC had allowed Siteserv to sell itself and it was assisted by Davy and KPMG.  Mr. Robert Dix, who was a non-executive member of the company, was appointed as chairperson of the Siteserv sales committee.  As chairman of the sales committee, he was described as a key decision maker, yet he travelled to Switzerland with Mr. McFadden to spend a week with Mr. O'Brien on a fitness holiday which was described as a boot camp.  The attendance at the boot camp just four days before Mr. O'Brien's company was given exclusivity, was not disclosed to the Siteserv board.  This was judged to be deliberate by the commission, which stated Mr. Dix gave untruthful evidence to the commission.  It went on to say he was not impartial in his role as chairman of the sales sub-committee.  Exclusivity, according to the commission, favoured Mr. O'Brien in the bidding process.  The commission deemed this to be one of the most important decisions in the course of the Siteserv transaction and it conferred a significant advantage on Mr. O'Brien.  Despite the fact that Mr. O'Brien's company's second round bid was reduced by &euro;3 million, the reduction was not disclosed to the IBRC, which seems extraordinary.  This non-disclosure was deemed to be deliberate and the decision to do this was made by Mr. Dix.  The commission found that Mr. Harvey, the CEO of Siteserv, concealed significant financial interest in the O'Brien bid from the board.  He also concealed from the board the fact that he had passed confidential information about the Siteserv sales process to Mr. McFadden, who in turn passed it on to Mr. O'Brien's adviser.  The CEO and some of the directors of Siteserv were aware of Mr. McFadden's role in relation to the entry of Mr. O'Brien into the Siteserv sale process.  The report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThese undisclosed negotiations led to the extraordinary situation in which Mr. Harvey, as CEO of a Plc, and Mr. McFadden (the two co-founders of, and major shareholders in, the Company) negotiated a 15% shareholding in Mr. O&rsquo;Brien's new company without anyone in the Company or the Bank being aware of it &ndash; even though the process was monitored by the Board of Directors of Siteserv, the Sale Sub-Committee, two sets of corporate finance advisers (KPMG and Davy), the Chief Financial Officer...the Company&rsquo;s solicitor (Arthur Cox), a representative of IBRC [and] the Bank. <\/blockquote>  <p>It really looks like they ran rings around them.  One wonders why questions were not being asked when that transaction was being discussed.  Even more incredibly, the bank agreed to receive a fixed amount of &euro;44.3 million in full repayment of the Siteserv debt.  This allowed surplus cash to be paid as bonuses to directors of the company rather than a further reduction of Siteserv's huge indebtedness to the bank.  It would be obscene for those who manipulated the sales process to the point where the commission described it as &quot;not commercially sound&quot; to retain those bonuses.  The bank must demand the return of the bonuses.  The leaking of a key confidential document by a person in Davy who was running the process, and who is now a very senior official in the Department of Finance, cannot be ignored.  Was that known or declared in advance of his move to the Department?  We need to hear from the Minister on the issue and what action he proposes to take.<\/p><p>I note Mr. Dix, who is so prominent in this report, who withheld a letter with a lower offer from Mr O'Brien, after he was awarded exclusivity, is a director of one of the companies the Government is currently doing very lucrative deals with for long leases of social housing.  We cannot see the same people emerging all of the time, even at this point.  The payment to shareholders in the context of such large write-downs was beyond controversial and the payment could have been reduced had IBRC asked Davy for an updated analysis on the performance of Siteserv.  That resulted in a direct loss to IBRC and, by extension, the State.<\/p><p>The year 2012 was when Siteserv, together with its subsidiaries such as Sierra - later to become GMC Sierra - was bought.  I refer to GMC Sierra because it started preparing to bid for contracts to install water meters, with the company hiring water meter specialists in mid-2011.  People had accepted so much following the crash, it was only after water charges were introduced that they started to take to the streets in significant numbers.  Having taken part in most of these protest marches myself and talked to people along the way, it was clear this was about more than water charges: it was a breaking point.  There was a feeling that all the pain was being felt by ordinary people, while another cohort of people were gaining from their misery.  So much for us all being in this together.  I began looking into this and it led me to Siteserv and its subsidiary, GMC Sierra, one of three companies appointed to manage the installation of water meters across six regions.  I make no apology for constantly banging that drum by all the means available to me and doing my best to make sense of all the material that was coming my way.  I believe that at all times I acted in the public interest.  While all of the information I received did not prove to be correct, I believe it was given to me in good faith.<\/p><p>In April 2015 I received a heavily redacted response to a freedom of information, FOI, request.  This response escalated the issue.  Here is a flavour of what it contained.  It stated: &quot;The Minister is very concerned with how a large number of transactions have been handled over the past number of months and this has led the Department to question the effectiveness of the CEO and the current Management Team.&quot;  It included quite a bit about Siteserv.  What was the basis for the Department coming to those conclusions?  Were there further complaints to the Department like the one that some of the bidders made to it about Siteserv?  If the Cregan commission is wound up, we need to hear from the Minister and the Department about what was the basis of it, because there are lessons to be learned.  There should be a sharing of information between Departments in that regard.<\/p><p>Ms Ann Nolan from the Department of Finance gave the following evidence to the inquiry: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe relationship with the Bank was unquestionably more strained than the relationship with the other banks in which the State had invested despite the fact that there was no material difference between how the relationship with the Bank was managed by the Dept. vis-&agrave;-vis the other banking investments of the State (AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent)...The only rationale I can offer is that the Bank resented being accountable to its sole shareholder, confused independence with lack of accountability...[The report goes on.] <\/blockquote>  <p>During the time I was raising issues around the transaction I talked to a lot of people and business culture in this country was repeatedly raised with me.  I had no doubt there was an aching desire by many business people for wrongdoing to be exposed and dealt with appropriately.  People wanted a business culture that was fair.  They told me that they did not mind fair competition but they wanted an honest process, and they wanted to be assured that was the case.  It is depressing to read the view of Anchorage, the other second-round bidder for Siteserv, which had increased its final round bid.  It said that the sales process was not conducted in a neutral fashion.  It is clear from the report that it was more than keen to acquire Siteserv and perhaps to further invest in Ireland.  It believed the process was &quot;rigged&quot; and described Ireland as a &quot;banana republic&quot;.  Anchorage was not the only bidder with concerns.<\/p><p>The Commissions of Investigation Act was an attempt to provide for inquiries that would substantially reduce the legal costs.  Mr. Justice Cregan insisted that there was a need for legislation to enhance his powers, and bespoke legislation was passed by us in this Oireachtas to provide for that.  This had the effect of turning this inquiry into a tribunal, but behind closed doors, with 42 individuals or organisations gaining legal representation at the inquiry, as of 2019.<\/p> <p>Indeed, the Taoiseach did suggest that different types of inquiries may be needed for different types of wrongdoing but we really need to catch this in real time without getting to that in the first instance.  Where inquiries have to be held in retrospect, it is essential that they are independent, timely and cost-effective.  We in the Social Democrats looked elsewhere for solutions and believe an independent, anti-corruption agency with strong powers, including the power of arrest, is required.  When researching this, the example we used was the model we found in Queensland in Australia but that is not the only model we can look at.  We need to look outside this jurisdiction at how other countries do things to find good examples of models we can introduce here.  <\/p> <p> This is a very sizeable document.  I nearly went blind reading it in the last week.  I hope that when the commission finally reports in relation to the other transaction we will have the opportunity to have another debate on how we will deal with these issues into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400030#CC00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663175100,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I welcome today's debate on the IBRC Commission of Investigation report.  It is a 1,500 page report but I am not going to pretend I have read it.  I know others have done so but I certainly have not read it.  I have read summary reports of it and it has been well documented in recent days.  It goes into great detail on the Siteserv transaction, making extensive findings of fact.  The Government accepts the findings of the commission and believes the report shines a light on unacceptable practices by certain parties during the course of the transaction.  Amongst its findings, the commission determined that the IBRC made its decision to approve the sale of the Siteserv group in good faith but based on misleading and incomplete information provided to it by the Siteserv company itself.  It also found that there was a \"below the surface\" process whereby certain events occurred in the course of the Siteserv sale process without the knowledge of the bank.  This \"below the surface\" process meant that steps were taken and decisions made in the course of the Siteserv sale process in a manner that was manifestly improper and which undermined the integrity of the overall sale process.  The commission also determined that it can be concluded that the Siteserv transaction was, from the perspective of the bank, so tainted by impropriety and wrongdoing that the transaction was not commercially sound.  It concluded that the bank could have recovered up to &euro;8.7 million more than the &euro;44.3 million it agreed to accept in the sale.<\/p>  <p>  Just before Deputy Calleary leaves the Chamber I want to join others in congratulating him.  I am delighted to see him on the front benches of the House again, deservedly serving as a Minister for State.  It is a proud day for his family and for County Mayo.<\/p>  <p> I will now make a few more general points about this commission of investigation.  Tribunals of investigation are hugely important in terms of providing transparency, identifying corruption where it has happened and uncovering how it has manifested itself but the length of time it has taken for this report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas is absolutely astounding.  The inquiry was set up ten years ago.  I read in an article in January of this year that &euro;80 million was spent on three tribunals over the past decade.  I am sure there have been more but the three in question are the IBRC investigation, the Moriarty Tribunal which ran for an incredibly long time and investigation into the NAMA Project Eagle loan book sale.  Those three investigations together had a cumulative cost of &euro;80 million.  They carried out very important work but the expenditure on that work needs to be scrutinised, as does the length of time it takes to report back.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which deals with an inordinate amount of criminal law cases each year operates on a very small budget.  It does not have a hugely resourced department behind it but it is able to get cases through the courts system at all levels every day of the week.  It concerns me that, while we are right as a body politic to extract the truth and deliver transparency on behalf of the taxpayers and citizens of our land, it takes an inordinate amount of time for these tribunals, inquiries and investigations to conclude their work.<\/p>  <p>  All of these tribunals have, I hope, cleaned up the body politic in terms of how the State, big business, banks and everyone does their business.  One of the upshots of all of this is that there is an incredible level of scrutiny of politicians and we put ourselves forward for all of that.  However, I would like to home in on an issue that some Deputies, Senators and councillors would have mentioned to Government figures in the past, which is the idea of politically exposed personnel.  Any Member of this House, any Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann or any member of a local authority is considered to be politically exposed from a banking and financial point of view.  We all know what that means in this House but for the record, it means that in the eyes of our banking system, there is a potential conflict of interest in terms of holding public office with an elected mandate and transacting with one's local financial institution, be it a bank, credit union or whatever.  However, it is not just applied to the individual who has chosen the elected way of life and who has a mandate from the people.  The politically exposed categorisation extends to family members to such an extent that if the 19 or 20 year old son or daughter of a Member of this House and or of a local councillor tries to raise a loan to go to college or to buy their first car, a clapped-out Ford Fiesta, he or she is deemed to be politically exposed and it can take eight months to get the loan processed.  It is wrong.  There have been people who have come through this House and abused their position.  Some of them have been found out and have been all over our national press and some of them have not been found out.  However, most people, and I say this with respect to people of all colours and creeds, who have been elected and who have come through the doors of the Chamber to stand up for their communities, counties and constituencies do it for the very best reasons, not for corruption and not for ill-gotten gains.  The idea of being politically exposed is wrong.  The political exposure, the transparency here is being recorded, being all over the press, having a record of everything we say and do.  We have the offices of SIPO just down the street.  This is where the accountability lies but I cannot fathom why the son, daughter, niece or nephew of a county councillor in west Clare, Roscommon, Mayo or Dublin is considered to be politically exposed and cannot go off and raise a simple, basic loan at the start of the 2022-23 academic year.  It is wrong.  It is bonkers.  <\/p>  <p>  This did not come in under this Government or the previous one.  I think it came in about nine or ten years ago.  It was a major reaction to tribunals, corruption and people abusing their positions but somebody should scream that this is madness and stop it, or at least row back on it a bit.  Certainly, we need accountability and I am sure there is more we need to do in that regard.  Maybe the fobbing in system needs to be looked at.  Maybe there is lots of stuff we need to do here.  I heard the Ceann Comhairle on the radio yesterday speaking about how Parliament can improve but good Lord, one would want to be living like an altar boy, leading a life of absolute purity with white smoke coming from the chimney of one's house to have any chance of sitting in a seat here and representing one's constituency.  Someone needs to look at the politically exposed issue.  By all means, put us under the lens but not our sons, daughters, in-laws, nieces and nephews.  I have not even told my in-laws that they are politically exposed but the bank will tell them when they go down and that is wrong.  That is absolutely wrong.  Someone needs to stop the madness.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400031#DD00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1663175100,"counter":337,"content":"<p>My own 25 year old daughter was refused the opportunity to buy a savings product with a reputable savings agency because she was considered to be politically exposed.

The report runs to more than 1,500 pages as everybody here is aware.  As I have only a short amount of time I will focus on the issues that stood out for me.  <\/p> <p>The report of the commission of investigation into the IBRC sale of Siteserv to Millington for &euro;45 million showed that as part of that deal, IBRC, which succeeded Anglo Irish Bank, wrote off &euro;119 million worth of Siteserv's &euro;150 million debt.  It is clear from reading the report that the integrity of the Siteserv sales process was compromised from the very start.  The phrase, \"tainted by impropriety\", is mentioned on more than 40 separate occasions within this report.<\/p> <p> The detail in the report leaves the reader in no doubt that certain individuals manipulated the process for their own self-interest.  These individuals concealed information and behaved in a manner described in the report as \"manifestly improper and wrong\".  The report also stated the Siteserv transaction was not commercially sound in the manner in which it was conducted, the decisions made and the outcomes achieved.  There are a number of examples of undisclosed conflicts of interest, something to which we have become accustomed with regard to other matters that will be discussed in this House tomorrow.<\/p> <p> The report found that in March 2012, the Siteserv board proved in principle the sale of the group.  It said Siteserv CEO, Mr. Brian Harvey, attended this meeting and voted to approve the sale.  He concealed from the board the fact that he had a significant financial interest in this particular bid succeeding.  Mr. Harvey also concealed from the board that Siteserv co-founder, Mr. Niall McFadden, was arranging a plan to avoid Mr. Harvey paying tax on his bonus.  The report found Mr. Harvey did not pay tax on his &euro;350,000 bonus or on the receipt of shares in the new company and that Mr. McFadden paid no tax on the almost &euro;500,000 finder's fee paid to him in shares by Mr. O'Brien.<\/p> <p> It also found that there was a below-the-surface process where certain events occurred in the course of the sale process without the knowledge of the bank.  This below-the-surface process meant steps were taken and decisions made in the course of the sale process in a manner that was manifestly improper and which undermined the integrity of the Siteserv sale process.  Bonuses of more than &euro;800,000 to Siteserv directors on completion of the sale were &ldquo;lavish ... and entirely unacceptable for a Company that was costing the taxpayer almost &euro;118 million in loan write-offs and losses&rdquo;.  Yet again, the taxpayer is on the hook, given the IBRC could have recovered up to &euro;8.7 million more than it agreed to accept in settlement of Siteserv's debt.<\/p> <p> Urgent reform is needed with regard to how inquiries like this debt are dealt with.  The commission took seven years to publish its report; clear evidence that we need a much more efficient way of getting to the bottom of matters such as those dealt with in this report.  Seven years is far too long.  The current system is broken and absolutely needs urgent attention.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, I spoke to a struggling business owner who received a sheriff's warrant letter for an unpaid tax bill of almost &euro;2,500.  Added to that bill was almost &euro;400 in interest, &euro;72 in bailiff's costs and &euro;160 in sheriff's poundage, bringing the bill to just over &euro;3,000.  Small business owners are struggling but as long as the vested interests are seen to, the Government seems to look the other way.  That is my opinion anyway.  Ireland is a great little country to do business in but only if you are part of the old boys club network.  As the saying goes, if I owe you &euro;1,000, that is my problem, but if I owe you &euro;1 million, that is your problem.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will change this and we certainly will.  We will turn the tide away from those vested interests in favour of ordinary workers and small business owners and their families.  This has to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400031#DD00600","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663175700,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I will start unusually by quoting a tweet from the renowned Mr. Vincent Browne:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIsn&rsquo;t it unfortunate for Denis O&rsquo;Brien that so many of his involvements result in controversy: the award of the Irish mobile phone licence; INM; Digicel; Beacon hospital over vaccines; and now Siteserve.  Perhaps it has all to do just with poor communications. <\/blockquote>  <p>We have to look at the bare facts of this report, however.  They are pretty astonishing, as is the fact that it seems the commission will not investigate the other 37 transactions in which the State-owned IBRC wrote off &euro;1.88 billion in aggregate between 2009 and 2013, the special liquidation.<\/p><p>There is no ambiguity in the case of Siteserv, however.  The heavily-indebted company debt manoeuvred the State via the IBRC to not only write off &euro;118 million of a &euro;162 million debt it had accumulated but it manoeuvred the sale of Siteserv to benefit its own shareholders and directors.  It did this by giving one bidder, Mr. Denis O'Brien, preferential and exclusive status in the bidding, not because it was the best offer for the company or, indeed, for the State, but because it was the best offer for them and their own self-interest.  Members should remember this was a company near collapse and likely to be unable to repay its loans.  Despite the 1,500-page length this report, it is careful to state that Mr. O'Brien was not guilty of any misdoing, nor it seems was the IBRC.  It just appears again, as so often has done in the history of this State, that Mr. O'Brien was unfortunate - it was a series of unfortunate events for him, which, oddly, yet again, while unfortunate, seems to have left him with an even larger fortune.<\/p><p>Mr. O'Brien's adventures in his interactions with this State would make a wonderful and entertaining movie; one in which our hero, despite the odds, always seems to come out on top.  This recent farrago must be set beside the good fortune, which sees another associated company doing very well from the national broadband contract.  Indeed, few here will have forgotten that while the water charges campaign delivered a major blow to the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government in its plan to charge for water and, undoubtedly, eventually privatise it, the national turmoil did at least provide a lot of contracts for Mr. O'Brien's companies in attempting to install meters on ordinary people's properties.<\/p><p>This report is fascinating and chapter 8, which is entitled The Trip to Bootcamp and the Role of Mr. Dix, is worth a read.  I urge everybody to read it; it is immensely entertaining.  I will read a portion of it for the record:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOn Saturday, 28 January 2012, the Chairman of the Sale Sub-Committee, Mr Robert Dix, ... travelled to St Moritz in Switzerland with Mr Denis O&rsquo;Brien and Mr Niall McFadden to spend a week on a skiing and fitness holiday, which they called <i>&ldquo;bootcamp<\/i>&rdquo;.  This was at a crucial stage in the Siteserv sale process, when second round bids were due to be submitted. <\/blockquote>  <p>Mr. McFadden, we are told was &quot;a highly experienced and sophisticated corporate financier&quot;.  The chapter continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMr McFadden had, over the years, organised a number of bootcamps ... [and he] and Mr O&rsquo;Brien had attended at least three such bootcamps together in Kenya and in Crete. ... On both of these occasions [they] had flown home on Mr O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s private jet. ... If Mr O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s bid were successful, Mr McFadden hoped to get a finder&rsquo;s fee from Mr O&rsquo;Brien for his introduction. ... [A]pparently, the exercise regime was [extremely] arduous ... participants rose at about 6.30 am to do an early morning run before breakfast and [after breakfast all of them] went out cross-country skiing. <\/blockquote>  <p>The chapter continues by noting that keen to go to dinner to another restaurant in the local village:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMr Dix and Mr McFadden went to their rooms to change before ... dinner.  Whilst in his room, Mr Dix participated in an important telephone conference call at approximately [six o'clock] with the Company&rsquo;s corporate finance advisers (i.e. KPMG and Davy) during which he was updated on the second round bids. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is a glimpse into the world of the other Ireland hidden from most people; an Ireland of corporate dealing facilitated by the State and made possible by the funds of ordinary people.  It is an Ireland where a ski trip to a high-end Swiss luxury resort is called a &quot;bootcamp&quot; and in which a deal the report found cost at least &euro;8 million more than perhaps it should have in reality cost us more than &euro;118 million in a write-off.  It was a deal that would bestow enormous benefits on all present if it went ahead and which, at a crucial stage, was not discussed by those present in the boot camp.  As they were all very sophisticated businessmen, they would not dare to discuss it.  The report confirms that our intrepid skiers did not say a word about the deal.  The commission found that the trip to boot camp did not have any influence on Mr O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s second round bid.  It found that &quot;Mr Dix and Mr O&rsquo;Brien did not discuss any Siteserv bids at bootcamp&quot;.<\/p><p>So ends the entertaining chapter.  It seems that while the lads were quite properly never discussing the deal at the bootcamp, the company co-founder, Mr. Niall McFadden, sent an email with confidential information to Mr. Dermot Hayes, an adviser to Denis O&rsquo;Brien, who was in the race to buy the troubled building services firm.<\/p><p>Something else was happening at that very moment in a nearby Swiss resort.<\/p> <p>The 2012 World Economic Forum at Davos had just ended.  It was the famous one where the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, told the great and the good of the world of finance that the crash and collapse of the Irish economy was explicable as a result of everyone having gone mad with borrowing.  We all partied, as a previous Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Finance explained.  That same week, Mr. O'Brien was boot-camping with friends and <i>The<\/i><i>New York Times<\/i>reported:<\/p><blockquote>\tAnglo Irish Bank is poised to pay more than a billion euros on Wednesday to unsecured creditors, drawing criticism from Irish taxpayers who are paying the enormous bill for the country's bank bailout.  The payment is part of Ireland's effort to shore up Anglo Irish, a state-owned bank now known as the Irish Resolution Bank Corporation, in a rescue that ultimately could top 47 billion euros, or $61 billion. <\/blockquote> <p>To be honest, given the sums dispensed by the State and the IBRC at the time, &euro;8 million was hardly likely to be a major issue for those gathered in Davos or St. Moritz.<br\/><br\/>We all partied, we all went mad borrowing.  That was the context of this deal.  That was how the great and good explained the crash and the merciless austerity they imposed on people here.  I do not believe that Enda Kenny had in mind the reckless borrowing of the great and good when he made his remarks up the road from Denis O'Brien and his mates in St. Moritz, nor the borrowing of Siteserv, which had accumulated other companies like an overenthusiastic collector in previous years, racking up unsustainable debts as it did.  No.  It was the workings of sophisticated businessmen.  Anglo Irish Bank dealt with a large number of sophisticated businessmen.  Many of them are back in business as we speak, having recovered fully from, or are even unscathed after, the financial collapse.  It is not so for ordinary people, who paid for their sophisticated schemes.  Far from St. Moritz and Davos, the bill has ultimately been paid by the people of this State, and it continues to be paid by them.<br\/><br\/>Let me end by remembering some of the measures from which we are still trying to recover, for example, housing and health, including waiting lists for operations for children crying in pain.  Consider the measures that the State, through the budget, forced on people in the very month that our heroes were at boot camp and our Taoiseach described us all as having gone mad borrowing.  The State imposed household property charges, it scrapped mortgage interest relief for new homeowners, it reduced the age limit in respect of children whose parents were trying to access the one-parent family payment, it reduced the earnings disregard for this group, who had consistently lived in high levels of poverty, it cut the back to education allowance, it attacked community employment schemes, it cut child benefit payments for families with three children, it cut the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, it cut benefits to carers, it cut fuel allowances, it cut hearing aid grants, and it cut the contributory and widow's pension entitlements.  We cannot forget the major cuts to the budget for Traveller education and funding either.  It was a war on the famous low-hanging fruit.  Beside the previous austerity, it made its mark on ordinary citizens and the public services on which they relied.  We have yet to recover from that.<br\/><br\/>The Siteserv deal and, indeed, Anglo Irish Bank itself were not the causes of that austerity, but these things and events are connected.  We should remember that, while some were in St. Moritz manoeuvring the State bank into a deal for their benefit, the ultimate bill was paid in our schools, hospitals, emergency housing centres and vital public services.<br\/><br\/>I hope that the shareholders and directors of Siteserv and, indeed, the countless other developers and sophisticated businessmen enjoyed their bailout.  This country still carries the scar of that as well as the continued servile attitude of our Government to serve their interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400032#EE00200","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663176300,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Berry, who is sharing time with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400033#FF00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1663176300,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute on this debate on the Siteserv scandal.  Once again, we have a detailed and comprehensive report that outlines dubious and poor practices and conduct in the performance by certain elements of corporate Ireland ten years ago during the banking crisis.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith pointed out, the legacy of that crisis is unfortunately still with us.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the publication, belated as it is, of the report and thank Mr. Justice Brian Cregan for his hard work.  I agree with his findings, and it is now up to the statutory bodies - the Revenue Commissioners, the Corporate Enforcement Authority and the IBRC special liquidators - to follow up on his comprehensive report.<\/p>  <p>  Many people have been let down by the performance, first among them the taxpayer.  We are potentially down &euro;7.8 million already but, as the Taoiseach outlined, there is at least &euro;12 million on top of that.  The costs will be multiples of that amount by the time they are determined by Mr. Justice Cregan.  The taxpayer has been let down.<\/p>  <p>  Second, corporate Ireland has been let down.  There are many good executives and hard-working business managers who behaved ethically throughout.  Unfortunately, they are branded with the same brush.  Anchorage, the underbidder for Siteserv, described in some of its correspondence that interacting with corporate Ireland was like working with a banana republic or one of the \"stans\".  That is certainly not the image we want to portray of our modern republic.<\/p>  <p>  Third, the thousands of people who worked so hard in Siteserv were let down by some of their senior executives.<\/p>  <p>  On a positive note, at least we can draw some comfort from the finding that IBRC acted in good faith.  The chief financial officer comes out of this report quite well.  It found that he conducted himself correctly and properly throughout the process and he had no prior knowledge of the under-the-surface behaviour.  I was struck by how he declined legal representation at the commission's oral representations because he had nothing to hide and he wanted to reduce the liability on the taxpayer.  That should be commended.<\/p>  <p>  This point lends itself neatly to what I want to say lastly on the cost of the inquiry.  It will cost tens of millions of euro and has lasted seven years.  I agree with the Taoiseach that we must devise a better system, one that allows for statutory inquiries to be done more swiftly and more cost effectively.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the report and agree with its findings.

That is the major question that is not being answered in any of our debates.  It is incredible that the Siteserv sale by the IBRC included a significant write-down of &euro;119 million to Millington, a firm controlled by Denis O'Brien.  That money was to come out of the taxpayers' pocket.  This happened at the same time that Siteserv was giving &euro;5 million to its own shareholders.  That a debt-laden firm in receipt of a &euro;119 million debt write-down could simultaneously afford to shell out generously millions of euro in dividends to shareholders is incredible and wrong.  We also see from the report that Arthur Cox acted for both sides of the transaction, those being, Siteserv and Denis O'Brien.  This is extraordinary.<\/p>  <p>  The sale of any product usually has the objective of attracting as many bidders as possible in order to increase the price.  That is the dynamic in an auction and most sales.  What we have in this situation, though, is a finding by the commission of investigation into IBRC that the opposite happened.  Anchorage was not contacted about the granting of exclusivity to Mr. O'Brien.  It was wrong that this would happen in a State organisation.  The commission found that the sale process conferred on Denis O'Brien a significant advantage over the other bidders seeking to acquire the Siteserv group.  This is incredible for our country.  It shows that maximisation of the financial return to the taxpayer was not the primary goal of the actors involved in the sale.<\/p>  <p>  That the chairman of the sub-committee in Siteserv, Robert Dix, would holiday with one of the proposed buyers in St. Moritz, Switzerland, during the sales process is incredible.<\/p> <p>Anybody with any idea of impartiality would have recognised that they were not doing their job right in that regard.  The key point here is that one person gave another person an advantage.  A person or persons, as quoted in the report, gave misleading or incomplete information to the IBRC, which led to an advantage being given to another individual at a massive cost to the State.  What is the next step?  This is where accountability has to be achieved by the State.  There is no point in anybody talking about this issue here unless we achieve some mechanism to get accountability.  If there is no accountability, then there will be no change.  If there are no consequences, then it will be repeated again in the State administration in the future.<br\/><br\/>I have written to the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, requesting that it would investigate the authors of the misleading and incomplete information.  I believe that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be given the necessary legislation so it can be the location of these types of investigations in future.  Someone needs to be charged as a result of these actions.  The Siteserv crisis was a massive crisis ten years ago.  I remember at the time the Government was nearly in danger of falling.  What happened?  A commission of investigation was created to neutralise that political crisis on behalf of Fine Gael.  It is a well-used political tactic used by governments.  The investigations go for on so long that most people forget what they were about in the first place.  The investigations are held in secret so that nobody knows what is happening.  This is not justice.  This report is not transparency, it is not accountability and it cost too much.  Not only have the citizens had to pay for the loss of nearly &euro;10 million in the original write-down, but the cost of the investigation was incredible.  We were meant to have the final report in 2015 and it was meant to have cost &euro;4 million, but here we are in the second half of 2022 and we just received the first of the original 38 modules.<br\/><br\/>In this Chamber the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, gave me an estimate that the final cost would be north of &euro;30 million and, if they were to proceed to all of those 38 modules, it would be more than &euro;70 million.  Some &euro;30 million is a multiple of the cost of the initial write-down of the commission&rsquo;s investigation.  It is no small money.  It would have paid for seven primary care centres in this State in the year that the commission of investigation was created.  This is not justice.  It is incredible that an investigation of wrongdoing in Ireland costs so much.  It have to be a bureaucracy that would end up spending &euro;30 million investigating a wrongdoing that led to a cost of &euro;8 million to the State.  No business or individual would spend multiples of the initial wrongdoing cost to find out what the wrongdoing was and, at the end, have a report that is meaningless in terms of accountability.<br\/><br\/>My worry is that we will get this particular report, that it will end up on a shelf somewhere in a Department, that it will gather dust and that, in a number of years, what happened in this area will just be part of a table-quiz answer.  So far, I have heard no meaningful expression in the Government about the next steps in terms of accountability.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach, interestingly, is also responsible for another investigation that went on for a long time, which is the &euro;1.4 billion sale of NAMA's Project Eagle portfolio to Cerberus in 2014.  The original finishing date for that was meant to be 2018.  It got extension after extension and excuses were given for the delay.  At one stage, an excuse was given that there was a skeleton staff in terms of the commission.  The Moriarty tribunal is still happening, believe it or not.  It still has a staff, a cost and a budget 24 years after it was established, at a price tag of &euro;65 million.<br\/><br\/>There is a real problem here and that has to change.  The commission of investigations system is not working.  It is not producing justice, it is not producing transparency and it is costing way too much.  It needs to be overhauled.  There should be a permanent commission of investigation that builds up the skills and staff necessary to deliver, within legislation.  It should have to do that work within budgets and within time scales.  If we do not do that, we will simply create commission of investigation after commission of investigation, each providing a report, each of those gathering dust and with nobody being held to account.

It did and that is what this report has told me.<\/p>  <p>  Imagine any business being offered a restructuring loan of &euro;70 million of interest only and approximately &euro;80 million of interest-free debt, which was offered to Siteserv.  It was a time when share options, commissions and valuations were not even being considered.  Where did the compassion go when it came to the ordinary person who was trying to manage their debt?  The banks at the time asked mortgage holders to fill out standard financial statements.  What an embarrassment.  However, nobody cared, not the regulator, not the Central Bank of Ireland and not the Government.  What has changed today?

It is as if, when people are working for the State and when they are engaged by an arm of the Oireachtas to carry out some function, that they literally have a blank cheque, there are unlimited resources, it can take as long as it likes, and it makes no difference what the outcome is because it is only all a puff of smoke at the end of the day.  The people actually never see any good for their money.  They do not see any meaningful results.  If there are not going to be meaningful results, would it not be a fine thing to spend the money on something that would produce a result for the hard-pressed taxpayers of this country?  People are suffering at present.  The one thing people want to see, feel and be assured of is that when their money is being spent, it is being spent wisely and prudently and that they are getting value for it.  Looking at our track record, and what we have done with investigations and look-backs, we are looking back so much that we will fall over what is in front of us.  We will not see what is in front of us because we are so hell-bent on looking backwards.  It is actually a massive industry.  It seems to be a very lucrative thing and the people involved are making vast amounts of money, giving vast amounts of time and coming up with very little at the end of it all.

I ask the Ministers of State what has changed today.  There is no accountability in the banks.  Will it take seven years to get answers from this Government to what happened in July of this year, when AIB stated that no cash would be available in its branches in my own constituency of Castletownbere, Dunmanway and Kinsale?

I named the case of the Clonmel Arms Hotel Project Jackdaw, because that it what it was.  The owner was able to get it back again when a new owner wanted to buy it.  Within five minutes he put in the bid.  A phone call came from agents working for NAMA to tell him that somebody else was interested in this business.  The corruption and skullduggery that went on inside those organisations was shocking.  It is still going on.  Fool me once and it is my fault, but fool me twice and it is your fault.

If I take a deep breath, the time will be up.  I have approximately six minutes to deal with a report that is over 1,500 pages long and has taken seven years.  The conclusions are absolutely damning.  It is significant that the D&aacute;il Chamber is empty.  The first senior Minister to be present since the Taoiseach left the Chamber is here.  That is telling.  No backbenchers are coming in to take their slots.  I seldom make these points because I realise how busy people are but this is a very significant report.<\/p><p>What is the report about?  Seven years after the commission was set up, the report tells us that there was a sale of Siteserv, a business.  It sold for &euro;44.3 million.  At the time it was sold, Siteserv owed &euro;162 million to the entity that is known as IBRC.  The business was sold for &euro;44.3 million.  At that point, the taxpayer had put &euro;43 billion into IBRC.  What is all this about?  The business was sold at such a low value that there was a write-off of &euro;118 million that the taxpayer is accountable for.  We are hearing today that this is a waste of time and we are rushing in to get rid of commissions of investigation.  I would say that is all premature.  I would ask the Deputies, and particularly the Government and the Minister, to actually read the report.  Let us find out what happened here.  The entity which was Anglo Irish Bank, on the one side, is declared a saint.  That is the corporate angel.  On the other side is Denis O'Brien, the personal angel who did nothing wrong.  In the middle, we have Siteserv, which was sold, and inexplicably it was left to sell itself with absolutely no oversight.  If I have the chance, I might return to the issue of the theoretical oversight that was in place.  Three gentlemen are named in the report, Mr. Harvey, Mr. Dix and Mr. McFadden.  They seem to have run rings around the angel on one side and the angel on the other side, the angel on one side being Mr. O'Brien, who did not know anything about anything, and the IBRC on the other side, in respect of which the judge found it acted in good faith, all its procedures were right and all its policies were okay.  How did this happen, then?  How did these three wise gentlemen run rings around everyone for their own benefit?  How did they conceal?  How is there a list of unauthorised disclosures and disclosures that were never made?  How did that happen?  How were the minutes of the official meetings of the board given to the Department on a regular basis in a board pack, but the <i>ad hoc<\/i>ones were never given?  How did all of this happen?  How did a boot camp take place in St. Moritz, with two of the important figures in this, the mere mortals in the middle of the two angels that did everything wrong, of course?  They misled and told untruths. <\/p> <p>I will read some of those in a minute but they have been already read out by various Members.  How did that happen?  The sale was \"tainted by impropriety\".  The report states that, \"non-disclosures and concealments undermined the integrity of the Siteserv sale process and tainted it with impropriety.\"  It goes on to state that, \"The Company's decision... to grant exclusivity to Mr. O'Brien\" and then continue with exclusivity to him was \"tainted by impropriety\".  It further states, \"The Company&rsquo;s decision not to disclose Mr O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Final Offer letter to the Bank... was tainted by impropriety\".  There is a whole list of these.  In the time I have I cannot possibly set out it all but the report sets out details on Mr. Dix - a slip of the tongue might call it Mr. Fix but we will stick with Mr. Dix - Mr. Harvey and Mr. McFadden disclosing confidential information which, \"was manifestly improper and wrong and undermined the integrity of the Siteserv sale process.\"  The report states, \"Mr Dix gave false, misleading and untruthful evidence in his sworn [evidence]\".  Mr. McFadden's evidence was not credible, according to the judge, on various aspects.  The report states that, \"The Commission does not accept Mr McFadden&rsquo;s evidence or his submissions\" on the matter and further states that it was, \"entirely implausible\" and so on and so forth.<\/p> <p> All of the time the angel on the left knows nothing and the angel on the right knows nothing.  These undisclosed negotiations that were going on led to the extraordinary situation, according to the report, in which Mr. Harvey, as CEO of Siteserv and Mr. McFadden, one of the two co-founders, negotiated a deal for themselves and nobody was aware of it, even though the process was monitored by the board of directors of Siteserv; the sale subcommittee; two sets of corporate finance advisers, KPMG and Davy; the chief financial officer, who has been mentioned already; the company solicitor advising both sides, Arthur Cox, with Chinese walls of course; and a representative of the IBRC, Mr. Hobbs.  I said I would come back to the monitoring.  We have an inexplicable decision by the IBRC to allow the sale to be managed by these men who have now been found not to be credible in any way.  I do not know why that was allowed but then they think about that and say they will monitor it and they talk about getting PwC in to monitor it.  They then do not do so but they get in Mr. Hobbs with his company.  Mr. Hobbs is paid &euro;5,000 per month into his company to monitor this situation.  He is supposed to be at all of these meetings and report back but of course there is no written agreement with the IBRC.  Even though it is angelic in all of this there is no written agreement so Mr. Hobbs goes to Siteserv and it determines what he should say and not say.  There is a little bit of upset over that so something better is agreed but nothing is agreed on paper.<\/p> <p> That is how this was monitored and we have Deputies here saying there is nothing in this.  This is a shocking and damning indictment of how business was done.  I will leave the conclusions to the judge but what I find difficult is an IBRC that knows nothing about anything and the judge says it acted in good faith.  Nobody is asking how the procedures and processes in place allowed this to happen, what Mr. Hobbs was doing and what he was being paid for.  Then we have the Department of Finance making a good decision to recommend an independent review, which was overruled by the Minister for Finance at the time, which he was entitled to do, so there was no independent review.  Tremendous work is being done by internal members.  The only time I see females mentioned is when they are doing the work in this.  The rest was all male-dominated.  They did tremendous work cataloguing and compiling everything.  Later on it all goes missing and the judge finds it extraordinary that various documents go missing.<\/p> <p> To be fair to my colleague I will stop but if the Ceann Comhairle has any influence I say this is a document that should be discussed for quite a number of hours on the floor of this D&aacute;il so that we analyse what has happened and learn from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400035#HH00700","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663178100,"counter":359,"content":"<p>In fairness to those who sit on the Business Committee, this was discussed there on Thursday last.

We need to find a method that allows the Houses to set aside time to have this debate and then we might have a real debate.  I would love to be able to hear a lot more of my colleagues' analysis of what went on within the report because that is vitally important.<\/p>  <p>  We have been waiting a long time for this report, seven years in fact, and the fact that it has taken this long calls into question whether the manner in which public inquiries are undertaken in this country is adequate.  It seems to me, based on this, that they are not adequately long but at the same time this is an important report and it is important that what went on is summed up here.  It is my understanding that, due to the long duration of this investigation and the accumulation of large costs to the State, there are now talks of closing down the commission.  I note that the Taoiseach said earlier that he will wait for the tribunal to comment on that before he makes his decision and of course he will wash his hands of it and say it is not his decision but the decision of the tribunal that we should go away from this.  Once again the political system walks away from this scot-free and has no involvement.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that urgent reform is needed and I would hope that if there was a question of closing down the commission then a vote on that motion would be brought to the D&aacute;il to consider because surely that is something this House should decide on and we could discuss why it needs to happen.  Although it took far too long to come to a conclusion, the findings in this report are absolutely in the public interest.  The report details a catalogue of issues which showed the sale process was undermined from the very beginning.  It explicitly states that the Siteserv transaction was so \"tainted by impropriety and wrongdoing\" that the \"transaction was not commercially sound\".  Chapter 15 of the report details bonuses that cost Siteserv more than &euro;800,000, which was more than the amount of Siteserv&rsquo;s corporate finance advisers&rsquo; fees combined.  It goes on to state that, \"In the context of Siteserv, these were bonus payments on a lavish scale and entirely unacceptable for a company that was costing the taxpayer almost &euro;118 million in loan write-offs and losses.\"  I understand that the Taoiseach has said the cost of the Siteserv inquiry \"could exceed &euro;30 million\" and I agree this is an indication of a broken system.  However, we are talking about the sale of a company that has cost the taxpayer more than &euro;118 million, in a time of real hardship in this country, when people were struggling to stay afloat, facing constant cuts and being hit with tax after tax, while Siteserv was lining its pockets with extravagant bonuses and charging ordinary people for it.  It is an absolute disgrace.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt this investigation was absolutely necessary and I would like to assure the Government that I have not forgotten that we were initially told by the then Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, that an inquiry into the transaction was not necessary.  It took three years of opposition pushback before an inquiry was sought and I would like to take this opportunity to commend Deputy Catherine Murphy on her pursuit of this.  I have no doubt this inquiry would not have happened if it were not for her endless work.<\/p>  <p>  There are many areas of concern in the report, including the fact that Denis O&rsquo;Brien was offered exclusivity on the deal; the fact that a finance official leaked confidential Siteserv sale details that would ultimately alert Denis O&rsquo;Brien to the sale; the fact that IBRC wrote off &euro;119 million of the &euro;150 million that Siteserv owed; the fact that IBRC lost out on between &euro;700,000 and &euro;2.1 million by not investigating shareholder payments; and the fact that the Commission found that no tax was paid by individuals on the capital gains on the sale of the 500 shares in Siteserv for &euro;2.3 million.  Denis O'Brien was innocent in all of this and knew nothing of it, yet he gave more than 15% of the new company to individuals because he knew nothing about it.  That stretches anybody's belief that this report finds everything that should be found and that was certain to be found.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400036#JJ00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1663178100,"counter":361,"content":"<p>It is interesting that all the speaking slots on this particular matter were not taken up.

This motion is before the Houses following approval by Government, on 27 July last, of my proposal to establish an independent office to lead an intervention at the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam.  The proposal was made following the signing into law of the Institutional Burials Act 2022 earlier that month.<\/p> <p>The Act, which provides the underlying legislative basis for the intervention, allows the Government, by order, to direct an intervention at a site where manifestly inappropriate burials of people who died in residential institutions have taken place.  An order can be made when the criteria in the legislation are met and where a resolution approving the draft order has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  <\/p> <p> The draft order for approval this evening directs me, as Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to establish an Office of Director of Authorised Intervention, Tuam.  It sets out the functions to be performed by the director and the land in respect of which the director may perform those functions.  The functions assigned to the director provide for him or her to oversee a phased forensic-standard excavation, recovery, analysis and re-interment of remains across the full available site in Tuam.  The order also provides that the director will carry out an identification programme as an additional function for the intervention.<\/p> <p> The situation uncovered in Tuam is truly horrifying.  It has shocked people across the country and the world.  The interment of children's remains at the site is clearly manifestly inappropriate and the statement of reasons for making the order, which has also been laid before the Houses, sets out how the site meets the requirements in terms of the legislation.  As I said before, what happened in Tuam is a stain on our national conscience.  It is incumbent on us to address the situation as soon as possible now that the necessary legislation is in place.  I am grateful for this early opportunity to bring the motion before the Houses.<\/p> <p> Subject to a resolution this evening, a resolution in the Seanad next week and the completion of environmental screening requirements for the site, the Government can make the order and the office can be established.  I am committed to appointing a director and starting the excavation at the earliest opportunity.  In order to ensure that work can start promptly, preparatory works have already commenced in my Department.  Environmental screening of the site is under way.  My officials have been seeking sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and liaising with the Public Appointments Service on the recruitment process for a director.   Officials are engaging with the Office of Public Works in relation to sourcing a suitable premises for the new office.   Preparations are under way for the appointment of an advisory board to support and guide the director in his or her role.  It is anticipated that the recruitment of a director will take a number of weeks.  Once appointed, the director will need to engage a range of appropriately qualified experts to undertake the excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis processes.  Engineering works and the construction of onsite facilities will also be required in advance of excavation of the site, which it is expected can begin in early 2023.

A rotten partnership between the State and the Roman Catholic Church perpetuated these abuses and actively opposed any form of accountability and justice.<\/p><p>The Tuam mother and baby home alliance was forced to protest again outside the D&aacute;il today due to its disgraceful treatment by the Minister.  It reiterated its call for the role of the coroner as prescribed in law to hold an inquest to establish the cause of death in compliance with international law.  It is highlighting how the Act intentionally does not meet international human rights standards.  It only applies in circumstances of inappropriate burial, but not in cases of unnatural or unexplained death in these institutions.  Despite pleas from survivors and human rights experts and amendments from me and others, the Minister has created a law that would limit the number of possible interventions and the scale of any intervention.<\/p><p>The Minister told me this Act should not cover examinations based on unnatural death as that is the responsibility of the coroners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Unfortunately, this Government's treatment of survivors and disregard for their preferences offer little hope for the justice they seek and deserve.  <\/p><p>The Tuam mother and baby home alliance also protested about other issues today.  It cites the Minister's recent unilateral decision to deny the alliance's members and those who provided testimony to the confidential committee the opportunity to have those testimonies reviewed by an independent expert with a human rights background, as he previously promised.  It is standard practice with this Government that survivors found this out by reading the work of Elaine Loughlin in the<i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and not from the Minister or the Department.  It is disgraceful.<\/p><p>There is a clear pattern.  Any progress comes after soul draining campaigning from a dedicated group of people and massive public outcry.  When Government eventually reacts, it always reacts just enough to get a good headline and satisfy public attention until the news cycle moves on.  Today is another example of this.  The headlines will look for the Minister but what about the survivor and family protests?  What about the failure to meet human rights standards?  What about the mass graves that will never be investigated unless something changes?  Our shameful history of State and church abuse and mass incarceration of young mothers, children, people experiencing mental health conditions and disabled people has left many locations of known and suspected burials.  Academics and activists have charted the scale of unnatural deaths in mother and baby homes, county homes, industrial schools, psychiatric hospitals and other institutions.  What about these victims and their relatives?  Where is their justice?  <\/p><p>I quickly came to the conclusion during pre-legislative scrutiny that this Act was designed to solely intervene in Tuam.  While this is essential and welcome, many other sites across the country require methodical and respectful excavation.  The Act is intentionally filled with barrier after barrier to prevent it being applied to any other location.  The State does not want this issue properly examined.  There is an aversion to giving survivors their information, allowing them to tell their stories and investigating our shameful past.  The Government is committed to doing just enough to create very limited prospects for justice.  If Government Members have convinced themselves they are doing the right thing, I inform them that they are not.  Today is an emotional and welcome day for the survivors of Tuam and the many people who know or hope that their loved ones are buried there, but it is a grim reminder to many others that their loved ones buried in other sites will never get justice.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400037#KK00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1663178700,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Connolly and then revert to the order on the basis that Deputies Cairns and Connolly were here at the start of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400037#KK00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1663178700,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I welcome and support this.  The motion was approved in July and we will set up what we promised we would in relation to Tuam.  It begs the question as to whether it is just Tuam and what about all the other places, as has been referred to.<\/p>  <p>  As I am wont to do, I will put it in context.  The expert technical group's report entitled Options and Appropriate Courses of Action was published in December 2017.  The Government announced a forensic excavation in October 2018.  The then Minister, Katherine Zappone, made some comments about taking the right actions.  In November 2021, when nothing had happened, Dr. Niamh McCullagh, a forensic archaeologist, among others, called for a full excavation of the site as soon as possible so that DNA could be identified.  She said: \"As a forensic archaeologist I have never walked away from human remains in that context.  The measures that were put in place to protect the site [in 2017]... were temporary measures, they were not designed to last longer than six months.\"  Yet the site remains there unattended and not properly sealed off.  As was mentioned by Deputy Cairns, the work on the ground has pushed this Government and every government reluctantly.<\/p> <p>From day one, I have acknowledged the Minister's bona fides although they are wearing thin in light of what he has done in going back on his promise.  On the ground, we have seen Catherine Corless and, well before her, Mary Raftery.  I also want to mention Patricia Burke Brogan, who died last week - may she rest in peace - with regard to the work she did in respect of the Magdalen laundries, in particular the play <i>Eclipsed.<\/i>I could mention many more.  The groups on the ground have certainly forced us and dragged us every step of the way.  I remember being at a meeting in Tuam and the Ministers present were talking about closure.  That was such an insult when we wanted openness and accountability.  It showed the level of misunderstanding there was.  I do not know whether it was benign or otherwise.  Why have I lost faith?  It is because we have no redress scheme nor any sight of one.  However, we know it will exclude anyone who spent less than six months in an institution.  I understand the Minister is in receipt of correspondence from more than 30 clinicians who work in the area of childhood trauma.  On 21 November, in response to the publication of the redress scheme, they wrote that &quot;there is no quantum of time that allows us to think about the impact of childhood trauma.  Thus, having an arbitrary period of six months' exposure is simply that, arbitrary.  Listen to that word: &quot;arbitrary&quot;.  The letter continues, &quot;What is known from research in the area of childhood trauma is that it is the combination of adversity and quality of relationships which confer risk&quot; rather than time.  The redress scheme proposed also excludes those who were boarded out.  Our own special rapporteur for children, Professor Conor O'Mahony, said, &quot;Any child who experienced severe neglect, emotional abuse or physical abuse in a boarded-out placement in circumstances where the State&rsquo;s inspection regime was clearly defective would have an entitlement to an apology and to redress in the same way as any other child who experienced neglect or ill-treatment in a residential institution&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>My time is short.  None of this makes sense to me.  Without referring to the Minister personally, the system has learnt absolutely nothing.  We continue to begrudge and to do everything belatedly.  If we are seriously interested in redress, let us do it right.  The Minister planned to have an independent human rights review of the testimony given by the more than 550 people who came forward but he has gone back on that.  I do not think he should ever have promised that because he was never in a position to do it.  He was never going to question the establishment narrative given to us by the three wise commissioners, the narrative that told us that the evidence of those who came forward was contaminated and should therefore be treated with caution.  They were never going to go back on what they said but the Minister promised to go outside of that and to have an independent review and he has gone back on that.  To add insult to injury, he said that he will allow the people to come forward again, if they wish, to tell the story again and have it archived or displayed, if that is what they want, or for what was given to be used.  This ignores the pain and the suffering of the more than 550 people who came forward with great courage to tell their stories, which were then described as contaminated by the three wise commissioners.  No such caveat was applied to those who came forward from the religious organisations or to the doctors and solicitors who came forward.  The Minister should never have promised that but, having promised it, he should have seen it through or, at the very least, given a proper analysis as to why he changed his mind and told the people on the ground personally, people who instead heard of it through an announcement in the newspaper.  Of course, there are also all the legal challenges with regard to that commission's report that were upheld or settled.  In all of this, the most important thing from day one was trust.  That trust is not there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400037#KK00400","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663179300,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me.  I apologise for missing my speaking slot.  I welcome the creation of the agency in respect of Tuam.  It is a positive step forward and something which we all know is long overdue.  We all know the various people, particularly Catherine Corless, who have campaigned for this for a great length of time.  We also know that time is of the essence in light of the age of many survivors and relatives of survivors.  I sincerely hope that we will also see this type of development in other areas where it is deemed necessary.  I missed the start but I believe Deputy Cairns made reference to the group that is outside today.  It was one of that group's desires that this would not just be done in respect of Tuam despite those in the group coming from and representing Tuam.  It goes to show the instinct among survivors to ensure that it is not just about themselves and their own individual stories but also about survivors as a collective.  They are always looking out for each other, for want of a better term.  It is important that this be expanded and not just be done for Tuam.  However, it is also important to acknowledge that this is happening.  It is a commitment that was made and is actually coming to fruition.  There may still be some concerns regarding the role of the coroner although I believe they were clarified in the most recent draft of the legislation.  However, any reiteration of that role would be helpful for survivors.<\/p>  <p>  It is our first day back.  When I saw that this motion was on the paper for discussion today, I thought that the commitment to an independent review that was made last year had to be mentioned.  I apologise because I was late and so may have missed reference to this in the Minister's speech but, if he did not make such a reference, perhaps he could mention in his closing remarks what exactly has happened in that regard.  We have all spoken a great deal about how, time and again, survivors, their relatives and their families have been let down.  Commitments and promises have been made that have not been followed through on.  We need a really clear answer as to what exactly happened there.  People want to know.  Obviously, we want to see that commitment honoured.  People welcomed it when the Minister made the commitment last year.  Deputy Cairns mentioned that people found out about this in the newspaper.  That is something the people who were outside today mentioned.  They feel really strongly about this.  They were very disappointed to read about this in the newspaper.  Is there another explanation for all of this?  I hope that there is.  Perhaps, if it has not been touched on, the Minister can expand on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will probably be inviting the Minister before it and will certainly be having discussions about this.  It is important for survivors that any commitments made are followed through on.  Over the years, we have had a history of letting these people, the vast majority of whom are women, down.  They were failed by the State in the first instance.  People who were made to go into these institutions or who were born into them started off being failed by the State.  The last thing we want, as a more modern generation in this Chamber, is to continue to fail them in that regard.  It is not good enough and we need to look at that.  We need to ensure that any commitment or promise we or the current Government or Minister give is followed through on and acted on.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the motion is specifically about the creation of the agency.  It is a good thing and a positive step forward.  Hopefully we will see the same provided in the other areas where it is needed.  However, I would like some clarity on what exactly happened and how this came about because, as far as I am aware, a review group was set up to look into who would be the best or most appropriate person to act as independent reviewer.  When that commitment was given, it was probably one of the few times people felt they were being listened to.  To see it being rowed back on is very disappointing.  \"Disappointing\" is probably not a strong enough word.  It would be welcome if we could get some clarity on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400038#LL00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1663179300,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  Like my colleagues, I will raise the issue of the promised independent review of testimony.  We have Elaine Loughlin and Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>to thank for the report in that newspaper dated 29 August in which it was said that &quot;A promised independent review of testimony given by mother and baby home survivors has now been abandoned by the Government.&quot;  I understand that the Minister is speaking directly to a motion in respect of the creation of the office of director of authorised intervention in respect of Tuam.<\/p> <p>However, this would have been the first opportunity since this news broke in August for the Minister to make some utterance to the House in respect of why the promised independent review of testimony has now been abandoned.  For many people, whether in Tuam, Bessborough, or wherever, that is the kernel of the issue right now.  They feel deeply traumatised by the fact that the independent review is not now going to take place.  It is for us to speak for those people.  It is a bit of a stretch to ask those people who have given testimony already to now create a new initiative.  I will quote from the Minister's adviser, who I assume issued the statement.  It read:<\/p><blockquote>\tHaving considered the matter, the minister believes that a new initiative to support survivors to tell their personal story, so that it can be formally recorded and accepted as part of the official record, provides the best opportunity for responding to the concerns of survivors in a meaningful way. <\/blockquote> <p>To expect a person who has already given evidence to now submit evidence again is an insult to those people.  I cannot for the life of me see how the creation of a museum or a national centre for research and remembrance will have the confidence of those very people who have given evidence and who feel their efforts and the sheer trauma they had to go through to tell their stories have been abandoned and disregarded.  I was very hopeful that we were on a pathway with this process and that by at least putting in place an independent review of the testimony, the Minister would have repaired the damage done and people would have moved in the same direction going forward.  Until such time as that issue is dealt with and confronted, and until an independent review is carried out of testimony, nobody is going to have any confidence whatsoever in the process.  The entirety of the process is now tainted.<br\/><br\/>I was hopeful that our generation of politicians would have dealt with this head-on.  When we were in the national convention centre I said I hoped this would not come down to an issue of money and resources.  I fear now that that is where this is at.  I am fearful that the Minister is afraid to reopen this process again on the basis of resources and what type of potential litigation might take place as a result of the reopening of such a process.  I do not think we should be so cautious.  We should be the generation of politicians that deal with this head-on.  We owe a duty of care to everybody who was involved in this issue to at least, as a mark of respect, carry out the independent review of testimony.  There is a question for the Minister in respect of the proposed memorandum to go to Cabinet.  As an institution, whether on the floor of this House or in committee, we need to provide some forum where the Minister can come before us to answer questions about why a process to create that independent review of testimony was abandoned.  What were the modalities of that?  This is unfinished business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400038#LL00300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663179900,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on the resolution the Minister has brought before the House today.  As a person who is from Tuam and who went to school in Tuam, this is an issue that is close to my heart in many ways.  It has created a sense of a stain on or shadow over Tuam as a town.  Tuam is a very good town.  It is the capital town in our county of Galway and has the finest people living there.  While I agree that the Minister needs to proceed with this effort to appoint a director, one thing is most important with whatever happens from now on.  The Minister set out in his speech how a director would be appointed, consultants and experts would be coming in with him or her and that an office will be set up to manage the excavation and all that goes with it.  However, it is important that there is local engagement with the people of the town.  The office should be set in the town and there should be a liaison aspect to the brief that this director will have so people from the locality who want to know what is going on can find out.  We talk about setting out the lands that will be excavated.  There are people living in close proximity to the centre of the site who have serious concerns about their properties having to be excavated, including their back gardens and so on.  There is a huge amount of work to be done with the local communities and local people on the ground, as well as working with all the other stakeholders.  I re-emphasise the fact that the most important stakeholders are the people in Tuam who have been the centre of attention from media worldwide.  So be it, but they need to understand what is happening and when it will be happening and they need to have somewhere to go where they can meet somebody if they have a query or an issue, someone who is not based in Dublin or anywhere else in the country.  I would expect that to happen.<\/p><p>It is important that we get on with the excavation and trying to identify the children who are buried there.  It is also important that that moves as fast as possible.  I am sure there is a lot of procurement to be done in terms of engineering, staff and consultants.  I hope that will not be clogged up in processes that will delay the whole thing going ahead.  We need to get down to getting on with the business as set out in the legislation previously passed here in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I welcome this further step but the people of Tuam and the surrounding areas, the people who believe they have relatives buried there, must know and understand what the next steps are.  It must be set out in plain language for them so they understand what is happening and when it will be happening.  The director and the office that is to be set up will have a huge role to play in making sure people understand what is happening and when it will be happening.  That is the one message I want to give the Minister this evening.  We need a hands-on approach on the site from now on because we are getting so near to focusing back on the site itself in a very physical way.  I thank the people in the locality for being very understanding of all the intrusion in their lives over the last number of years.  For some of them, it has been a tough time.  Now is the time for us to make sure we ease what will have to happen over the next number of months and years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400039#MM00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1663179900,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  They were absolutely right to recognise the pivotal role Catherine Corless has played in this.  We would not be here today but for her dogged persistence in highlighting what happened in Tuam.  The Deputies are right to credit her with dragging the Irish State to this place today.<\/p>  <p>  The passing of this legislation was a lengthy process, one that involved very substantive engagement with the joint committee and significant amendments in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>When I visited the site at Tuam last year, I also met four separate groups on the day.  Their key request related to the coroner and removing the exclusion of the coroner's jurisdiction that was originally in the legislation.  We removed it because we heard what people had said.  The reasons that officials or I put forward, that it was not as big a concern, did not matter.  It was a concern for survivors and we acted on that concern.  We made other changes in the legislation.  Deputy Connolly referred to Dr. Niamh McCullough.  I am grateful for the advice she gave to our Department, particularly about strengthening the processes that will take place following the excavation of the site.  This post-recovery analysis gives us a better opportunity to return sets of remains to family members.  There is a clear requirement written in the legislation that work taking place on this site must be done to an international forensic standard.  I hope that provides some comfort to families in Tuam and potentially in other sites about the type of work that will take place.  In the amendment process, we also added an advisory board which will be convened and will have survivors or relatives of residents of the institution.  It also has an opportunity to involve the wider sector, as Deputy Canney said.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember that this legislation is not site-specific.  It makes provision for interventions in other sites as well.  I have engaged with relatives of people at the Bessborough site.  My Department intervened in a planning application last year for work to take place on the site of the presumed children's burial ground there.  In August of this year, I visited Sean Ross Abbey and met relatives there.  We discussed their concerns about the potential wider burial ground there.  We are working with survivors to get a resolution relating to that site.<\/p> <p> Deputy Connolly mentioned the redress legislation.  This legislation has been worked on by my Department over the summer and I will bring it to Cabinet in October to seek approval for the final Bill and to bring it rapidly through the Houses and the committee so that we can provide redress to family members.  The Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has written to me about the testimonies before the confidential committee and I will provide a comprehensive response.  The Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will consider that.<\/p> <p> When the comments were made at the lecture in Oxford about the treatment of the testimonies, we all received correspondence from survivors.  What shone through most clearly in that correspondence was the concern from the 550 survivors who had given testimony that, having gone to the effort and, in many cases, trauma of reliving what happened, their words were nowhere.  We know their testimonies are not in the commission's report.  There are just brief extracts of them.  Prior to that, my officials had secured the tapes of those interviews.  As we know, those tapes were meant to be deleted but we secured them and have them now.  I am seeking to provide an opportunity to those that gave testimony so that their words are not just hidden away on a tape somewhere but are actually part of the record, whether they wish to express those words themselves or they wish to use the tapes as evidence of that record.  I am conscious that there are other survivors who did not participate in the confidential committee who may wish to have their personal stories of what happened to them in institutions also expressed on the record.  That is what I am attempting to provide for survivors in the proposals that I am bringing forward.  I will write to the committee in more detail and the committee can decide about the next steps.  That is the proposal that I will present.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputies for their consideration of the motion today.  My Department and I will work to ensure, assuming assent of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, that the agency can be set up as quickly as possible and that this essential work in Tuam can proceed as quickly as possible to provide that small measure of comfort to families at the end of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400039#MM00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663180500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Measures to Assist with Household Bills: Motion [Private Members]","time":1663180500,"counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400040#NN00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1663180500,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes:  \t&mdash; the latest round of announcements of electricity price hikes ranging from 27 per cent to 34 per cent to take effect next month; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that households are dealing with annual electricity bills, some &euro;1,000 higher than they were a year ago; condemns the constant dithering by this Government despite the urgency of the cost-of-living crisis including:  \t&mdash; the refusal of this Government to bring forward an emergency budget before the summer recess despite calls on them to do so, with people left to face the full impact of continuing energy price increases alongside wider increases such as food and back-to-school costs without adequate support as a result;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the opposition by Minister Eamon Ryan, acting on behalf of the Irish Government, to reform the wholesale electricity market back in October 2021 which would if implemented at the time have helped to reduce the bills of households and businesses sooner; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the failure of the Government to sufficiently accelerate the development of our own renewable sources of energy in and around the island which are key to ensuring energy affordability, sustainability and security over the medium-term; and calls on the Government, as part of a wider package of cost of living measures, to immediately:  \t&mdash; cut household electricity bills and cap them at 2021 prices;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce cash payments to assist low- and middle-income households with their other energy bills;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; make a double Child Benefit payment for every child in recognition that households with children tend to spend more on energy bills; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce a windfall tax so that excess profits are not made during the period of the crisis.  <\/blockquote>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  I am sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Broin, Mac Lochlainn, Kerrane and Doherty.  This motion sets out a number of proposals that we believe are essential to address the cost-of-living crisis.  They are specifically focused on the price of electricity.  I call for support for the motion across the House.  We need an aggressive and comprehensive response to an unprecedented crisis which is having a significant impact on families and is the most pressing concern for families around the country.  We set out in the motion our proposals to cut household electricity bills and cap them at 2021 prices, to introduce cash payments to assist low and middle-income households with their other energy bills, to make a double child benefit payment for every child in recognition of the fact that larger households have greater energy and electricity demands, and, importantly, to introduce a windfall tax in order that excess profits are used for the benefit of our population and people in need.  The motion has a number of proposals which will be part of a suite of social welfare and taxation measures that Sinn F&eacute;in will propose in our alternative budget in advance of the Government's budget.<\/p><p>In my contribution, I will focus on a couple of aspects, namely, the electricity price cap and the windfall tax.  They are intimately related proposals.  A clear recognition that the market is broken and must be reformed underpins both proposals.  This has been clear for over a year.  Gas is being used as a weapon of war.  Any of us who have engaged with those working in this sector have had it indicated to us that it was apparent, as far back as this time last year, or earlier, that the tap was being turned by Russia.<\/p><p>The electricity price cap is the right move at the right time.  It provides certainty for families who are under huge pressure.  It provides a reprieve for families at a time of great pressure and uncertainty.  While it is not a permanent solution, it buys time to introduce the sort of systematic reforms that are needed.  We have to get the balance of universal measures and targeted measures right.  We need to lean towards prioritising targeted measures.  As a universal measure, it has the advantage of maintaining the link with usage.  It is, in effect, an electricity unit price cap as opposed to an electricity bill price cap.  We saw the Government's proposal for a credit being introduced slowly earlier this year.<\/p> <p>We have seen the various kites flown in recent weeks: it could be a &euro;600 credit over three payments or it could be further beyond that; it would be denied to Travellers in halting sites, as it was before; it would be denied to some living in multi-unit buildings where there is only one meter; and it would be given on the double to people with holiday homes - energy credits will be a bonanza for those people.  That proposal from the Government has the same weaknesses that it always had.  It goes hand in hand with a windfall tax, individual and important elements to address a broken market, and the super-excess and crisis-related profits of energy companies.  There are two parts to any windfall tax, which are the huge profits being made by energy generators, which the European Union refers to as a solidarity tax, and the huge windfall that arises for renewable companies because of the pegging of gas prices to electricity prices.  The suggestion that Sinn F&eacute;in is at risk of writing a blank cheque to energy companies is the greatest bluff of them all, especially coming from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, who are the parties that sold off our gas assets.  Vermilion Energy reported a 267% increase in Corrib profits between 2020 and 2021.  In the second quarter of this year, the parent company recorded &euro;214 million in profits, up 28% year on year.  That was all sold off to the private interests.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael also sold off our gas utility companies, deregulated the market and, as they did with so many things, treated energy as a commodity not as a right and a utility.  This Government fought for a year against reforms of the EU energy market.  Why?  It was to protect the profits of the energy companies in the hope, nothing more, that they would invest those profits in new energy infrastructure, some of which was hoped would be renewables.  We missed the opportunity of the Iberian exemption, despite having a real opportunity to make the exact same case.  This Government has a clear track record of not doing enough.  The Sinn F&eacute;in proposals contained in tonight's motion point in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400040#NN00400","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663181100,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues, Deputies O'Rourke and Doherty and others for tabling this important motion today.  Like Deputies right across the House, pretty much every day I am dealing with families who are experiencing a level of financial stress that I certainly have never seen in my time as a Deputy in this House.  For example, I am dealing with housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants who are unable to keep up with the cost of living and their top-up to the landlords.  They are begging their local authorities to give them a discretionary uplift, which they are being refused, and therefore they are imminently at risk of homelessness.  I am also dealing with private renters who are just above the thresholds for social housing and who are working two jobs to keep the roof over their head.  This is despite the fact that the Government has not increased the social housing thresholds since 2011 and continues to refuse to do so.  Again, those same families are unable to make ends meet or are fearful of what will happen if they get a notice to quit, which would render them homeless.  I am talking to mortgage holders who have now had two interest rate hikes.  If the second hike is passed on by their bank, that will wipe out everything we are hearing from Government with regard to the meagre measures it is proposing to deal with the rising cost of energy.  I raise these three cases because they are real-life cases that I and many other Deputies are dealing with day in and day out.  Common to all of these families is that they simply cannot afford the cost of heating their homes or using utilities to keep their children fed and to keep clean the clothes on their backs.  The idea that giving those people, on its own, a cash payment no matter what amount, simply does not deal with the key concern they have which is that even with a cash payment, the prices themselves are too high and people are fearful of further price hikes.<\/p>  <p>  The great merit to the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal that Deputy McDonald outlined earlier today, which Deputy O'Rourke has just outlined, and which Deputies Doherty and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell will outline in fine detail when we publish our alternative budget on Friday week, is that it deals with the immediate cost by dragging those costs back to summer 2021 levels, it puts money back in a targeted way into the pockets of lower income families, and it ensures that they will not have any further price rises between now and February or March of next year.  I do not see how anybody could think that this was not the most sensible way to approach this.<\/p>  <p>  Today the Taoiseach was incredibly disingenuous when he used the phrase \"blank cheque\".  From all of the media that Deputies Doherty, McDonald and others did yesterday, the Taoiseach is aware that the purpose of our proposed windfall tax is to be a tax on excessive profits if companies choose to try to use it as a blank cheque, which is something they would not be able to do under our proposals.  This is sensible and it is needed.  If the Government does not do something like this, those families out there who are under such enormous pressure, will have the worst winter in decades.  It does not have to be that way.  The Minister can make a real difference and I urge him to support this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400041#OO00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1663181100,"counter":382,"content":"<p>When it comes to the energy crisis, workers and families are really being failed by this Government.  The Government announced a cost-of-living package back in February when inflation was at about 5.5%.  For much of that time the Government added what was announced then with what was announced in the budget four months beforehand, which was the Government's cost-of-living budget.  Throughout recent months, inflation has climbed to more than 9% and yet people are still waiting for help.  Aside from the electricity credit, which by the time it was paid nearly five months after it was announced had been wiped out, the only other energy support that was announced was the fuel allowance.  The fuel allowance is an extremely limited scheme.  The vast majority of households, and particularly workers, are locked out of the fuel allowance.  They do not receive it and they have never received it.<\/p>  <p>  In June the additional needs payment was announced.  It tweaked what was there in relation to the urgent needs payment.  This was welcome.  I welcomed it at the time.  This, however, is one way in particular in which Government is failing households.  This payment was widely promoted by Ministers.  I would like to think that it was presumed obvious that demand for this payment would be high given that it was particularly aimed not just at those on social welfare but also at workers.  Yet, the entire process around this emergency social welfare payment is up in a heap.  Demand for that scheme in January or February was about 5,000 or 6,000 applications.  As of July, it was more than 17,000 applications.  Figures I received earlier this month from the Department of Social Protection show that 95% of current applications are taking between five to eight weeks to be finalised.  Can the Minister imagine having a bill that cannot be paid in a household struggling and waiting up to two months for what is supposed to be an emergency payment?  Before the D&aacute;il recess, the Minister had said that the Department was giving consideration to putting that payment online as an option for people.  That is still, apparently, being looked at by the Department.  We need to return these payments to the community welfare officers within our communities if we are going to make sure that this support is available to people when they need it.  Applications like that need to be resourced properly in order that people get support when they need it.  If they are waiting for two months, it is no good.  Clearly, demand for that scheme is going to increase.  The proposals in this motion are exactly what is needed.  They reduce costs and put money back into people's pockets.  Existing supports that are there need to be resourced.  Emergency social welfare payments cannot take two months to be processed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400041#OO00300","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1663181100,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The response of the Government to this energy crisis has been dithering, dithering and dithering again.

This is just a shameful response to an unprecedented energy crisis that our people face, be it home heating oil, solid fuels, or petrol or diesel for their cars.

Families are facing a cost of living crisis they have never seen before.  Many of them are being forced into decisions they thought they would never have to make, like whether to put food on the table or to keep the heat going.  Families that once would donate to the food banks are now standing in those queues waiting for those same parcels.  The choice before the State is simple.  It can, on one hand, allow citizens to fall into poverty and financial hardship or wake up to the reality, step up to the plate and fulfil its duty and act.  That is what the Sinn F&eacute;in motion before the House calls on the Government to do today, to act in the interest of our people in the middle of this cost of living crisis.<\/p><p>Our motion is very clear and has a number of areas.  First is energy.  Compared to last summer with the winter we now face into, households are paying an average &euro;1,300 more on their electricity bills.  Sinn F&eacute;in says that needs to stop.  We need to cut those bills for those families, workers and households.  We need to bring it back to its level prior to the crisis, back to &euro;1,000 on average.  We need to do that during the period of this winter and to not only give families a reduction in their electricity bills but also something so valuable in these pressing times, certainty that the bills will not increase and that on this issue the Government has their back and can say &quot;we are with you on this and are taking the pressure from you&quot;.  It is a simple proposal.  It is one the Minister's European colleagues in other jurisdictions have implemented.  Romania has extended the cap on energy prices until August next year.  France has nationalised its system to allow for certainty in energy.  Other countries have used different models.  We should be doing the same.  We need a government that understands the crisis that families are in and that is not willing to dither but rather to act in the interest of people.  It can be done just as others have done.  Energy and electricity prices can be brought back to where they were pre-crisis and bills reduced by up to &euro;1,300 annually and kept at that level until the end of February.  It is time-limited.  It is not a blank cheque or any of the sound bites the Government throws out.  Instead of grappling with our suggestions that would help people, it tries to dismiss them and brushes them away.  On top of that, we also need an excessive profit tax similar to that in Italy.  The Minister will be familiar with that.  It has increased the rate recently to ensure energy providers are not profiteering through the crisis.  The Government could give a commitment to underwrite the difference in the price of electricity charged to households and the cost to the companies of delivering it.  Those are two proposals that can work.  But we recognise that families and workers are facing many more pressures, including that of heating homes with the price of home heating oil or gas or the increased costs of food and clothing, as well as petrol and diesel to go from A to B.  They are essential costs in this day and age.  That is why we need to see the Government go further.  We need cost of living cash payments targeted at those who are most in need.  Individual incomes for those over 18 years below &euro;21,000 need &euro;500 in their pockets in the next month.  We need to see step-down payments for people earning up to &euro;70,000 to help them get through these winter months.  Politics is all about choices.  The Minister knows that.  I know that.  These issues are about choices but many people sitting at home who might be tuning in to this debate cannot see the choices.  All they see is the rattle of the letter box and another bill which has increased coming through it.  They are afeared of the postman or postwoman walking down their lane.  It is time for the Government to act.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn observed, the <i>Financial Times <\/i>has pointed out that this Government is the second worst in Europe in relation to its spend as a proportion of GDP in supporting businesses and households during this energy crisis.  The Government needs to wake up to what is really happening.  It needs to understand the depths of the crisis and where workers and families are at.  We are putting on the table the solutions that are needed.  These are the policies I would implement were I Minister for Finance and I say to the Minister that these are the policies he and the Green Party should be implementing were they worth their salt in this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400042#PP00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1663181700,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this critical issue and allowing us to have this debate this evening.  Clearly, the situation we are witnessing with increases in energy bills and the cost of living is the matter of utmost concern and is central to everything at this time in the country.  We are keenly aware of the growing pressure on families and businesses.  We have been thinking about and working on this for the past year and a half because this started some year and a half ago for a variety of different reasons.  It began with the Russians starting to turn off the gas over a year ago in anticipation of the war.  We have been working and talking at length with our European colleagues and other colleagues to get the right policy response.  It is affecting every European country.  It is the impact of international gas prices going up, on which we are agreed.  I heard that for the first time today.  For the last year there has been all this debate, confusion in my mind, as to what is the cause of the problem.  The cause of the problem is the war in Ukraine; that is putting up the price of gas and that is putting up the price of electricity.  Many people have avoided saying that or disagreed with that or doubted it but after this summer, it is as clear as day.  Thank God, at last, we know what the problem is.  Energy, and with it the inflation that comes from its price increases, is being used as a weapon of war by the Russian Government.  It wants the cost of living to divide us, to undermine western democracies and our support for the citizens of Ukraine as part of the war effort.  We cannot divide.  We have to stand strong and protect our households and businesses as we do so.<\/p>  <p>  As the said Taoiseach today, there is no question.  Do we have to intervene?  Of course we do.  The question is to get the intervention right.  We started a year ago.  We have been intervening.  I want to review some of the measures in my contribution.  We will go further in the budget in two weeks.  However, I agree with the Taoiseach that we must be careful to respond in the right way.  I am afraid that Deputy Doherty does not have the right plan.  I do not think the measures he proposes are the optimal but that they may be contradictory and counterproductive.  I understand he will come out on Friday and explain the details and not on Friday week, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.  That will be very useful because it bears really detailed analysis.  These are complex markets and interventions.  I know very well the French, Spanish and Romanian measures and those of others.  We have looked at them in detail with our colleagues and came to our best conclusions.  They are not finalised yet because we are still working with the European Commission.  However, it seems the combination of measures that Deputy Doherty is proposing will not work well.  I wait to hear the finer details because it needs details.  We need to do highly complex market interventions.  The Deputy needs to that on Friday and not Friday week and I look forward to hearing it. <\/p>  <p>  We do need to introduce a windfall tax on both the electricity market and on fossil fuel companies.  That is what we are working with the European Union to do.  It is better to do it in a co-ordinated EU way because what Putin wants to do is to divide us and create division and doubt in Europe.  So we are working on that.  <\/p> <p>The Commission presented the proposals today.  They are so complex that it is necessary to look at each country to see how they might apply.  There is flexibility and, in my contribution, I will outline why I think there needs to be flexibility in how we adapt to them.  We were very much central to designing, promoting and supporting them in that European Council and also at a further meeting of energy ministers which took place on Sunday and Monday where we again took the opportunity to discuss in detail the right thing to do.<\/p> <p> There has been a suggestion that nothing has been done; that is not a true.  The &euro;2.4 billion worth of measures that we implemented are important and I think we can learn a lot.  We need to understand what they were and what they could be in the upcoming budget.  I will set out some of the global market developments behind this.  I want to set out the role of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The key thing we need to focus on is protecting our householders.  I want to outline what we have done in some of those energy-efficiency and welfare supports.  First, it is important to describe what has been happening with prices in the market and to clarify that those energy price increases were not created by the Government or by regulatory decisions.  Price regulation in the energy market ended many years ago.  Suppliers compete with each other and set their own prices as one would expect in a competitive commercial and liberalised market.<\/p> <p> Increases in wholesale energy prices followed a rise in international gas prices, which has been the principal driver of the increases.  Some 50% of our electricity comes from gas and it is setting the market price.  Those prices started to rise back in 2020 for a variety of reasons, including increasing demand in Asian markets and power generation in Europe switching to gas for different reasons.  As I said, early in this process the Russian Government started to switch off gas in the expectation of reducing the stores of gas Europe has in advance of a war.  I believe that was done strategically in advance of knowing a war was going to take place to try to weaken the European position.  That is why there has been so much focus on gas storage over the summer.  We came into this spring and summer with very low European gas stocks because of those actions by the Russian Government.<\/p> <p> There was an increase in gas prices earlier in the year but what happened in the last week of July and the first three weeks of August was beyond compare because the markets saw for real that Gazprom was about to switch off the pipe, in particular Nord Stream 1 which supplies so much of Europe.  That is why over this summer the scale of the price increase accelerated even further again.  That is why we need to respond.<\/p> <p> It is a Europe-wide phenomenon.  Some countries are more exposed than we are because they are directly connected and have a much higher percentage of Russian gas in their systems.  That is why the European Energy Council met in Brussels last Friday.  It was an extraordinary emergency meeting to assess what could be done and consider different measures to try to protect consumers across the Continent.<\/p> <p> In that meeting, the Commission set out a five-point plan for immediate emergency measures.  There was a range of other medium- and long-term measures.  However, because of the price increases over the summer we realised that together all of us in Europe needed to act fast now to protect our people.<\/p> <p> Serious measures include the capping of revenues.  The European proposals include caps, but it is the cap on the revenues of those energy companies making supernormal profits.  That is the right cap in my mind.  I look forward to hearing Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals on an alternative cap that does not give them a blank cheque.  In a sense rather than capping the revenues, Sinn F&eacute;in would allow it to continue.  I would like to see Sinn F&eacute;in's further analysis giving the detail on getting that combination together.<\/p> <p> The second measure is the introduction of a solidarity levy on the fossil fuel extraction industry.  Our primary example of that is Corrib and we need to be appropriate and clever in getting it right in line with European law and so on to ensure we can also participate in that.  That is what we have discussed in the Council and since.<\/p> <p> The third measure is critical.  I have been trying to highlight its real benefit.  It is incentivising demand-reduction, particularly at peak times.  President Von der Leyen set out the Commission's paper this afternoon.  The reason we focus on that peak hour, particularly with larger energy users, is that if demand can be reduced at that time, it brings down the price for everyone.  That is a really practical way to help householders and businesses.  That last plant at the peak time is the most expensive.<\/p> <p> We need to provide liquidity and support mechanisms for energy businesses which are in difficulty and may not be able to pay the advance collateral for householders' bills over the following two months.<\/p> <p> I support the proposals for a wider cap on international gas market prices which are completely out of kilter with where they should be.  To get that right we need to work with countries such as Japan, South Korea and Norway to ensure it can be effective and work.  Europe needs to use its purchasing power to try to protect our householders.  That is complex and not easy.  The Commissioner asked what the mandate was.  In my contribution I said, \"Go for that as best you can but it will only work if there is real international co-operation in what we do.\"<\/p> <p> I am sorry I do not have time to set out all the measures.  I set them out in my contribution to the Seanad earlier, including everything we are doing with CRU to protect vulnerable householders, all the critical social welfare payments along with the energy credit.  I disagree with Sinn F&eacute;in; I think we need a credit.  This is so significant that it is appropriate to get a payment out to every household.  While I accept targeting social welfare at those with the lowest pay and the most vulnerable, I am not sure that cutting out a whole swathe of Irish society from getting that credit is the right response.  We need to stay united and protect all our people, but these are unprecedented times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400042#PP00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663182300,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Households are facing the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.

Europeans are facing into a winter of record energy prices, but in Ireland people are contending with energy cost increases on top of what was already an unmanageable cost of living.  We have extortionate rents, childcare costs that are equivalent to a second mortgage, and mortgage increases.  That is just to mention a few.  Energy is only the latest crisis that people in Ireland have to contend with.  People were already on the brink, but this winter they are going to be pushed over the edge.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's response to this crisis has been disgraceful and slow.  It has failed to accelerate the development of our own renewable energy resources, which is key to ensuring energy affordability, sustainability and security.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, opposed reform of the wholesale electricity market in October 2021, which would have helped reduce energy costs.  The building of new data centres was encouraged all the way, despite repeated warnings about their effect on our energy sustainability and security.  On top of all this, the Minister continues to increase carbon taxes.  It has been said repeatedly over recent months that people will not be able to heat their homes this winter.  People will have to choose between heating their home and feeding their family.  It is a crisis situation.

On this side of the House, as well as on the Government benches, we are all conscious that if these crises are not urgently addressed by the Government we are going to see severe hardship visited upon families, households and businesses over the coming bleak winter.  We are going to see the poorest households forced to take impossible decisions between heating or eating.

We are told by charities about couriers, people who are working and who deliver food to others, but who cannot afford to buy food for themselves.  They are turning up for free dinners handed out by the charities.  That is simply not acceptable.  We hear from small business owners, who are faced with soaring energy bills that are now reaching the level of an additional rent or leasehold.  These are extortionate costs that households and businesses are facing, and we need to see concerted and urgent action from the Government on it.  That is why we in the Labour Party very much welcome the opportunity tonight to debate the upcoming budget and the package of measures necessary to address this hardship.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned that yet another generation of young adults is forced to emigrate.  I am from a generation that grew up in the 1980s when emigration and unemployment were high.  We were facing a 20% unemployment rate and, like now, we were seeing families at their wits end with unaffordable prices for food and fuel.  Some things are very different from the 1980s.  Now we have what could be described as a paradox of plenty where we have got a successful macro economy.<\/p> <p>We have Exchequer figures showing a surplus of &euro;6.3 billion for the first eight months of this year alone.  We do not have the sort of unemployment figures that we had in the 1980s and that is obviously extremely positive.  All the more reason, then, to address the spiralling cost of living because the resources are there.  We in the Labour Party have called on the Government to take ambitious, radical and creative measures, to adopt State-led measures of the sort and scale that we saw during the Covid pandemic in order to tackle the hardship that will be faced by so many families, households and businesses but what we are hearing from Government is a lack of urgency.  It appears that there is no reassurance forthcoming from Government.  We are told to wait and see what the forthcoming budget will contain.  People are really fearful now about what is coming down the tracks and yet it appears that in Government Buildings the blinds are down, the shutters are up and obviously the heating is off as we all seek to cut costs on energy.  <\/p> <p> I am meeting people who tell me that six months or a year ago the incomes they had were sufficient to meet their costs.  I am talking about two-income households, about people in what would be considered good jobs who are no longer able to meet costs like the &euro;1,200 monthly that people are having to pay for childcare and early years education.  That is what parents are paying in Dublin Bay South now.  People are having to think twice about bringing a child over six years of age to the doctor because each doctor's visit is costly.  We know that households are now facing the prospect of energy bills of up to &euro;6,000 per annum next year.  These are the sorts of burdens and hardships that have to be addressed.  We really need to see very strong and urgent action from the Government.  <\/p> <p> On the energy crisis, we in the Labour Party have called for a three-pronged approach.  We want to see the immediate introduction of a windfall tax on excessive profits in energy companies.  I raised this earlier today with the Taoiseach.  I very much welcome, as do my Labour Party colleagues, the moves at EU level that the Minister spoke about to devise such a tax.  We have also called for a maximum price cap on energy bills and the extension of eligibility for the fuel allowance for low and middle income households.  It would cost &euro;15 million to bring 16,000 new households within the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance.  That in itself would be a significant way of alleviating hardship for those families.  On the windfall tax issue, the Minister mentioned very briefly in his opening remarks the Corrib gas field, which I raised earlier today.  The Taoiseach mentioned that we import 75% of our gas but there is a glaring elephant in the room here.  The Corrib gas field supplies about one quarter of our gas needs.  It is local supply, on this island.  Revenues from Corrib increased almost fourfold last year and the company is enjoying another year of bumper profits yet nothing has happened to increase the cost of production or supply of Corrib gas.  There is no international competition to boost the price of Corrib gas and yet the price has increased dramatically.  That is why I raised with the Taoiseach earlier and raise again now with the Minister the proposal that we look at what powers are available to Government to ensure that the cost of indigenously produced gas can be reduced in order to go some way to meeting the cost of this energy crisis.  Clearly this is not a panacea but is just one measure that could be considered.  We are proposing that Government would look at existing legislation, including the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982, which were introduced by previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments to equip the State with the power to regulate and control the supply and distribution of fuel including gas and invoked previously during the oil shortages in the 1970s.  When one looks at that legislation, one sees that there are clear powers there that could be invoked on a temporary basis for the duration of this emergency to ensure that all Irish-produced gas could be sold to the State on a cost-plus basis, in substitution for the current distorted international prices which are not relevant to the market for Corrib gas.  We all acknowledge that the market at EU level needs radical change in any case.  Indeed, the EU and Ms Ursula von der Leyen have acknowledged that.  Just looking at our own supply, though, there is a measure available to Government now because the State could then sell Corrib gas into the Irish market at a reasonable cost-plus price.  We have done some creative thinking on this and I urge the Minister to consider this measure.<\/p> <p> Clearly there are also many other measures that need to be introduced to alleviate the pressure on households and to ensure that families and individuals can get through the winter ahead.  We need to see vastly enhanced environmental initiatives incentivising a rapid switch, nationwide, to renewables.  I know the Minister has already brought forward some measures on that but there are some things that could be real win-wins like increasing the grant for solar panels, for example.  We should be really encouraging more and more households to invest in and switch to solar power because that will have a double-positive effect of both reducing emissions and tackling household energy bills.  <\/p> <p> We have also argued in the face of this chronic cost-of-living crisis that Ireland needs a pay rise and that as a minimum we should see an increase in the minimum wage so it becomes a living wage.  That is something that the trade unions have called for and that is clearly necessary.  We also need to support small businesses facing the massive hikes we have all heard about in energy bills and basic costs.  My colleague Deputy Nash has proposed the introduction of a temporary wage support scheme modelled on the pandemic-era schemes to provide much-needed relief to small and medium enterprises who are struggling with vastly-increased bills.  <\/p> <p> Of course, in the face of a chronic lack of housing, we need to see massive State investment in a building programme providing public homes on public land and affordable homes for all.  We are also asking the Government again to adopt the Labour Party's legislation providing greater protections to renters around security of tenure and against rent hikes, including a freeze on rents for three years.  We have also called for a number of emergency measures to address the unprecedented cost-of-living crisis, including a cap on childcare costs to &euro;200 per month because that would bring us into line with the sorts of costs faced by parents in other countries for childcare and early years education.  That is the sort of immediate measure that could be brought in and we received some interesting costings from the Exchequer on that.  At &euro;270 million a year, it is not an excessive cost when one looks at the difference that investment would make to so many households.  We have called for the introduction of a climate ticket, giving people unlimited access to public transport around Ireland for &euro;9 per month.  This is the sort of innovative measure we saw introduced in Germany on a pilot basis this year which proved to be so successful.  Our costing on that is around &euro;150 million to bring that in for the three months to the end of this year.  It would make a dramatic difference to households who are currently facing huge transport costs, would really incentivise a switch to public transport and help us to tackle our climate emissions.  We have also called, as we have done for many years, for the immediate extension of free GP care to all children under 18 which can be done for a reasonable sum.<\/p> <p> I am conscious that we will have other opportunities to debate the budget.  We in the Labour Party will be putting forward a fully costed, alternative budget but the real message tonight is that we must see urgent measures from Government.  We are in a situation where we have an Exchequer surplus and we need to see that money invested to help alleviate the hardship that so many families and households face and to address the real and chronic fears that we are hearing about all across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400044#RR00400","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663183500,"counter":395,"content":"<p>We are in the worst cost-of-living crisis in more than four decades.  The price of everything, including basic necessities, is soaring.  People all over the country are worrying about how they are going to feed their families and heat their homes.  The speed with which prices are increasing and the extortionate levels they are reaching are unprecedented in their scope, scale and catastrophic impact.  Even before this crisis, Ireland was the second most expensive country in the EU, with living costs 36% above the EU average.  Our housing costs were the highest in the EU.  The price of goods and services here were the second highest in the EU and our fuel costs were the fourth highest in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Today what was a cost-of-living crisis has become a cost-of-survival crisis for a large and growing cohort of our population.  We all know what this cost-of-survival crisis looks like.  Food costs that are expected to increase by up to &euro;700 per annum.  House prices have now exceeded Celtic tiger levels with nowhere near the same recovery for wages.  The recent ECB interest rate increase is going to apply even more pressure on already-struggling homeowners.  Meanwhile rental costs long ago soared into the stratosphere and are now priced at more than &euro;1,600 per month nationally and an extortionate &euro;2,200 in Dublin.  There appears to be no upper limit when it comes to rental prices despite the Government's failed attempts to curb increases with rent pressure zones that are not fit for purpose.  Childcare costs are equivalent to a second mortgage for parents and the notion that we have free education once children progress to school is a bare-faced lie.  Parents have to fork out up to &euro;1,500 at this time of year when children go back to school just to provide the basics like uniforms, school books, transport and so-called voluntary contributions which schools demand because the Government does not provide sufficient money for them to heat classrooms and keep them clean.  Healthcare costs for services like GP care and therapeutic care are another burden that fall disproportionately on families who have children with additional needs and on adults with disabilities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400045#SS00200","speaker":"1627"}]
