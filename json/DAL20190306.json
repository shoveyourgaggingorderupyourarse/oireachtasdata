The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, an independent agency of my Department, is responsible for planning, co-ordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs.

It is open to any school to make application to the NCSE to establish a class.  In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE takes account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.  In that regard, the special educational needs organiser, SENO, may approach individual schools to discuss the matter with a view to finding the optimal location in terms of convenience and sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  When the NCSE sanctions a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to reconfigure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation.  SENOs, who are locally based, are available to assist and advise parents whose children have special needs.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in\u00a0enrolling their child in a school, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.  SENOs are also available to\u00a0assist and advise schools on special education supports and planning.<\/p>  <p>  The number of ASD special classes in County Dublin has increased from 66 in the 2011-12 school year to 197 in the 2018-19 year, which is a threefold increase.

The prerogative is on the board of management to make the initial application.  Following that, a decision is made on whether a special class is sanctioned.  One must look at the trajectory in this regard.  In 2011 we had a total of 548 special classes in this country and now we have upwards of 1,500 special classes.  This year, we are spending nearly &euro;1.8 billion of the budget of the Department of Education and Skills on special educational needs.  There has been a change in the admission to schools policy.  Deputy Lahart asked me if I could intervene in the process.  Since 3 December 2018 a change was introduced.  There is a provision in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act, following the completion of the process, that is, the consultation, the engagement with the SENO and with the school and if a board of management makes an application, for the Minister to compel a school to provide an extra class.<\/p><p>However, this is after all areas have been exhausted in the meantime.

I am aware that with a cohort of 4,000 primary and secondary schools in the country, there are many old buildings and buildings that are challenging from the point of view of provision of this service on site.  There is an opportunity for schools and boards of management to decide to make provision for special classes.  They can look at reconfiguring existing spaces.  This is a difficulty because many of our schools are already at capacity, they are maxed out, but there is a provision to construct additional accommodation as well.  I re-emphasise and reiterate that if the board of management comes forward with the idea and suggestion of looking at providing for a special class, the NCSE and the SENOs will meet the board.

We accept the Department of Education and Skills has got more money than in previous years but it has got less for its money.  It is a complex area and there seem to be a number of drivers for such changes.  Famously, there is the issue of land costs, for example, the &euro;28 million paid for Harold's Cross dog track, the scale of schools being built, the areas in which they are being built - all of which relates to the value of land - the change in the nature of schools, the way in which schools are being built and construction inflation.

We are also looking at the 2014 regulation which changed the specification and at the 2017 change with regard to NZEB - the nearly zero energy building standard - which is working towards more environmentally efficient buildings.  I am very conscious that we have to get value for money from the taxpayers' point of view and, while there is construction inflation, that we do not just accept there will be increased costs and allow that to carry on.  We build in a detailed design element to the schools and, by having a detailed element complete prior to tender, we get fixed-price contracts, which ensure the price and ensure that whoever wins these contracts sticks within that.  It is a question of efficiency and value for money.  We are still going to be delivering over 40,000 places from 2018 to 2019 and there are still many buildings under construction.

My Department has advised the schools accordingly.

The proposed section 5A of the Road Transport Act 1978 is an enabling provision which gives the Minister power to make an order should it be required.  These provisions were developed as a precautionary measure and may not be needed in the event of an orderly withdrawal or if alternative measures are agreed at EU level or in another international context.  Having regard to international bus services, there are a number of scenarios under which it will not be necessary to make an order under the new section 5A.  On this basis, it would not be appropriate to require the making of such an order by amending \"may\" to \"shall\".  The amendment also proposes that an order under section 5A would need the assent of the D&aacute;il.  Secondary legislation involves the delegation of power from the Oireachtas, in this case to the Minister.  Requiring D&aacute;il assent would be unusual and is not necessary.  On a more practical note, such an assent procedure would unnecessarily delay the making of such an order, which could lead to difficulties in the scenario which may need to be addressed by using these provisions, namely, that of a no-deal exit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600012#K01200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551870000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551870000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551870000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Section 72 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551870000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Sections 73 and 74 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551870000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>SECTION 75<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551870000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 46:<\/p><blockquote>In page 50, line 34, after &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;transport&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>On behalf of the Government I propose a technical amendment, No. 46.

Under Article 24.2 of the convention, a contracting state may require any driver admitted to its territory to carry an international driving permit.  However, there is no requirement for drivers with a UK driving licence to produce an international driving permit while driving on Irish roads and that will not change.  In addition, there is legislation in place that allows for the recognition of foreign driving licences for exchange purposes.

We have all had callers to our clinics to inquire about the status of their driving licence post 29 March.  The Department needs to send a clear message on what the exact situation will be.

I understand the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is advising holders of a UK driving licence to swap it for an Irish one while the United Kingdom is still a member of the European Union and before it becomes a third country because it can be done seamlessly and there will be no issues.  In that regard, if somebody swaps his or her driving licence now, the date of issue will have an impact on his or her annual insurance premium.  I wonder if the Minister or his officials has or have had any engagement with the insurance bodies to ensure such drivers will not lose all of their years of driving experience that they have built up when they transfer their UK driving licence for an Irish one.  I understand - the Minister may correct me if I am wrong - the UK Government is providing reassurance for Irish driving licence holders that they will continue to be able to travel and drive in the United Kingdom on their Irish driving licence.  There is an anomaly in what we are saying on this side of the Irish Sea compared to what is being said on the far side.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Motorists travelling across the Border or to elsewhere in the United Kingdom will need to have a green card.  The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland is advocating that there be a turnaround time of approximately four weeks and advising that those who make frequent crossings - no one is hoping for a no-deal scenario or a hard Brexit - will need to factor in a four-week turnaround time in obtaining a green card or they will not be covered by their insurance.  I also understand that, in the event that there is a hard Brexit at the end of the month, if somebody who does not hold a green card is stopped in Northern Ireland, his or her car will be impounded automatically.  It is a serious consequence for somebody who will not be carrying a green card.  I want to know what the Minister and his officials have been doing to inform motorists of the need to hold a green card.  I also want to know why Article 8.2 of the EU motor insurance directive was not invoked.  My understanding is that if it was invoked, it would allow the Commission to enable the United Kingdom to remain in the green card free circulation area post Brexit.

They have managed to do it because they put in the effort and time to doing so.<\/p> <p> I will not say the Minister does not care but I do not believe he realises just how important these issues are for people living in Border areas and the nightmare it will be, in particular with regard to licences and green cards.  Workers will be travelling to work on a daily basis, family members will be visiting each other and tourists will be travelling.  If a farmer is driving a tractor across his fields and one field is in the North and the other is in the South will he need a green card?  If he has an accident in his tractor will he need a green card?  These are the basic day-to-day issues that are leaving people in total confusion as to what they need and what they must do and the Minister has done nothing to resolve it.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, made it clear the option for addressing the issue is under Article 8 of the EU motor insurance directive and the EU can give a waiver to Britain and the North for the requirements of green cards, as it did with Serbia in 2011.  However, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has made no attempt whatsoever.  It is hard to credit, given the problems this will cause for people, that he has put in no real effort.  Everybody knows he should have been pushing the EU to get the waiver but he did not do so.  He has let everybody down by not doing it.   When we think about the problems this will cause, it seems the Minister is completely blind to the sensitivities around this issue.  I knew from the time I asked him at a meeting of the transport committee about the green card that even on the basic points regarding when it was due, whether people would have to pay for it and how many would be required the Minister had to be prompted with the information.  He did not come in with all of the information.  This tells us he did not have the inclination, the care or the concern to look into it so that he would be across it and would make representations to the EU on the common travel area.

The setting of a date is possible under Article 8.2 of the motor insurance directive.  The Commission has not given agreement to date and the Government continues to pursue the matter with it.  The Commission advised the MIBI and the international Council of Bureaux that it is keeping the matter under close and constant review as part of its Brexit preparedness work.  This is very important.  Ireland has had discussions with the European Commission regarding Article 8 of the insurance directive but the final decision is with the Commission and Ireland is still pushing on that issue.  We do not like it, and we have made it quite clear we do not like it, but it is there and we must live with it for the moment.  We will push against it as hard as we can.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Troy's issue, insurers and insurance brokers have advised they will begin issuing green cards to policyholders any day now.<\/p><p>I believe they have begun to issue them or will do so in March 2019.  As preparation, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, has printed green cards and distributed them to these organisations.  It has indicated that approximately 1 million green cards have been sent to insurance companies and brokers.  It is a matter for insurance brokers as private commercial organisations to determine whether there will be an administrative charge for the issuance of green cards.  I answered this question already but I will answer it again.  The Deputy said I did not answer it at the last committee meeting.  I did.  I answered questions on fees quite specifically.  Neither the Government nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to regulate charges which may be made in this regard.  It is an unwelcome development, but it is example of prudent advance planning on the part of the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland and the wider insurance industry.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember that the green card is used as proof of insurance.  People have been making a mistake in this regard, though I am sure Deputy Munster has not.  It is not an insurance policy in itself.  The vast majority of Irish motor insurance policies already include cover for travel in the UK.  In such cases, drivers will continue to be insured to drive in the UK even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  However, they will need to carry a green card as proof of insurance if no other agreement is reached within the European Commission in the meantime.  Not all policies may include such cover in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  In that eventuality, drivers who may be travelling to or through Northern Ireland or Great Britain should check their motor insurance policies.  If in doubt, they should check with their insurers that such travel will be covered.  Enforcement of the law on motor insurance is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If a person is driving a UK vehicle in this jurisdiction following a no-deal Brexit he or she may be required by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to produce a green card as proof of insurance.  Driving uninsured is an offence.  If a person who should have a green card does not, this may cause difficulties in proving that they have insurance.  That is carefully worded.  It is for the authorities in Northern Ireland to determine what enforcement measures regarding green cards might be taken in Northern Ireland in the event of the UK exiting the EU without a deal.<\/p> <p> A clear message has been fairly well-publicised by the Road Safety Authority, the Department and the insurance bodies.  The issuance of 1 million green cards reflects sudden and urgent demand.  Adequate numbers of cards will be issued.  I take the point that we need to use all outlets to make sure everybody knows they should get green cards.<\/p> <p> In answer to Deputy Smith, I note that people resident in Ireland who use UK driving licences should seek to exchange their UK licence for an Irish licence before 29 March.  This is advice is going out from all quarters and I think it is fairly well-known at this stage.  We will put alternative arrangements in place post Brexit when the UK is a third country.  To cover that particular point, visitors to Ireland with UK driving licences can drive on their UK licences in Ireland for up to 12 months.  In the meantime we fully expect that perfectly adequate reciprocal arrangements will be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600014#M05700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551871800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The Minister's last point was that the Department and other bodies are advising people to swap their licence before the end of this month.  Is the Minister satisfied that there will be sufficient personnel to deal with the upsurge in applications for new driving licences?  Will these applications be processed in a timely manner?<\/p>  <p>  Second, the Minister did not answer the question of what engagement he or his officials have had with insurance companies on the possible consequences for people's insurance premiums, given the fact that they will now be driving on new Irish licences that have only been issued this month.  Will their previous records be recognised?  We all have heard anecdotal evidence that people who have driven in Ireland previously come home after a year or two abroad and find all their past records are null and void and are not taken on board.  They are effectively first-time applicants from an insurance perspective.  What engagement has the Minister had with the motor insurance industry to ensure that the insurance premiums of people who transfer their licences will not be affected?<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, I have spoken on a number of occasions about the availability of driving licences to asylum seekers.  They are not available to asylum seekers in Ireland.  They are available in the UK, and there are a small number of asylum seekers here who have UK licences.  I assume they will not be able to transfer them.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the huge efforts the Minister and his officials have made around the green card and in trying to invoke Article 8.2.  Perhaps he might share with us some of the replies he has received to the efforts and the submissions he has made on this issue.  It is strange that other countries have benefited from this.  The House should know who is trying to block or prevent the invocation of Article 8.2 of the motor insurance directive.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister says that he cannot be responsible for what the PSNI in Northern Ireland does.  The bottom line is that, just as in the Republic of Ireland, the Legislature makes the laws.  The Garda and the PSNI implement the laws.  If the law of the land states that a driver must have a green card and the penalty for not carrying one is the impoundment of their car, we cannot criticise and say we do not know what the PSNI is going to do.  We do know what it is going to do.  It is a huge issue for people who go across the Border very frequently.

That is our ambition.  That is what we wish to do.  The suggestion that there is some sort of lack of will or energy on our part on the issue is an accusation made out of total and utter ignorance.  It is unnecessary and unhelpful.  The European Commission is well aware of our views on it.  I am certain that these representations have been made frequently and will continue to be made until the green card is removed or some other solution is enacted.  That is what is going to happen.  We are united on this issue and it is a pity that there should be any division introduced.  We are united in that we wish to see the green cards removed.  We see them as politically difficult to accept altogether, but to suggest that somehow because they remain there, there is a lack of action, will or energy is not true.  It is not going to happen.  That process will continue.<\/p> <p> There is ongoing engagement by my officials with the Commission on Article 8, including recently when a very high-level delegation came to Dublin.  Intensive talks have been going on between my officials and the European Commission on this issue and other issues on an hourly, daily and weekly basis.  This is not something which is being neglected.  It is being pursued with as much vigour as is possible.  It is fair to say that an enormous amount has been achieved, which we see in the Bill in terms of buses and in other areas to ensure the smooth running of transport between Northern Ireland and southern Ireland, even in a no-deal scenario.  That is what this is all about.  Not everything is resolved, but we are going to ensure that the trains and buses will run as normally as possible on 29 March, even if we have a no-deal scenario, which we hope we do not have.<\/p> <p> The Road Safety Authority, RSA, is giving priority to the exchange process for UK licences.  In response to Deputy Troy, it wants to give as long as practicable for people to get their licences.  Deputy Troy asked twice whether we had talked to the insurance companies to ameliorate the effect on premiums in certain situations.  He will find that it is a matter for the insurance companies.  No-claims bonuses are based on driving experience and are not linked to the licence issue date.

Credit is due to the many people involved in ensuring the convention was agreed.  What is the status of the convention at this point?  Various processes are in place in this State and in Britain.  The Minister referred to a 21-day period in which the British Government would engage in a consultation process before the convention would be signed.<\/p><p>My second question relates to the fuel allowance and the winter fuel payment.  That is an issue I have raised previously.  We are not sure about the changes involved to such payments because there is no reference to them in correspondence or the legislation.  I have sought clarity on the issue a number of times from the Minister.  For example, I sent her a letter last week seeking clarity on what will happen.  There is much fear about the fuel allowance and the winter fuel payment.  Currently, more than 31,565 people living in this State receive the winter fuel payment from Britain.  The number of recipients of the payment has been increasing annually.  In 2011, there were just 6,810 people in receipt of the payment.

It is significantly different from the heads we discussed at committee on the basis that the convention will cover social insurance payments.  The remainder - the reduced section, as it were - will deal with social assistance, so that will still be covered by legislation, whereas social insurance will be covered under the convention.  In this regard, I ask the Minister again, where are we with the convention?  Have the British ratified it?  Will it come into operation on 29 March?  If not, what happens then, given that we have dropped the legislation that would have been operable had the convention not come in?  Furthermore, does section 77 cover the full range of social welfare payments in respect of which we have a reciprocal arrangement with the UK?  Is any payment excluded because we did not decide to continue the reciprocal arrangement?<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to ask the Minister a question about private pensions.  I know that this section deals with State pensions - that is, pensions payable by the Department for Work and Pensions or, on our side, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection - but the latter is the Department that has responsibility for statutory provisions relating to pensions, both public and private.  The Minister will be aware that reports persist that Irish people, people who are resident here and who are in receipt of private pensions from UK organisations, may have to open sterling accounts, which of course we would all be extremely concerned about.  I think the suggestion was that some sort of banking arrangement needs to be put in place to resolve this issue.  On behalf of these people, I seek reassurance from the Minister for reassurance on this point or at least an update on what the up-to-date position is.<\/p>  <p>  As for the amendment itself, I notice that the legislation gives the Minister the right to introduce orders.  I acknowledge that the next section we will deal with gives the Minister the right to introduce regulations.  The usual provision in respect of regulations is that there is another section stating that any regulations must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will come into operation within 21 days if a resolution annulling those regulations has not been passed by the Oireachtas in the meantime.  What is the position on orders?  My understanding is that section 287 of the 2005 Act, which this legislation proposes to amend, makes provision for reciprocal arrangements.  Subsection (1) allows the Minister to make such orders as may be necessary to implement any of those reciprocal arrangements.  I take it that reciprocal arrangements have been made with all other EU countries and the EU itself, that an order has been made to that effect and that power was given back in 2005.  What, then, is the Minister proposing here exactly?  Is this just about providing for the situation in which the UK becomes a third country in the event of a no-deal Brexit?<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister might clarify those few points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600017#P00300","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1551873000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Are any other Members indicating?

Section 77 provides for an amendment to section 287 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 regarding the continuation of a whole range of social welfare payments.  Section 287 is the section of the 2005 Act that allows me, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to enter into bilateral arrangements with other countries.  The amendment set out in section 77 of the Bill provides for, among other things, the insertion of a new subsection (3) into section 287 of the 2005 Act.  The purpose of this new subsection is to enable me, the Minister, if necessary, to make an order with regard to the way in which arrangements under this section interact.  Such arrangements may cover a number of issues, such as the recognition of contributions paid in other countries, which, it is to be hoped, will now include the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>As Deputies will be aware, due to the unique nature of the common travel area and the associated rights and privileges it provides and will continue to provide for Irish and British citizens in one another's countries, it was agreed that Ireland and the United Kingdom would formalise the pre-existing common travel area social protection arrangements in a legally binding agreement.  This agreement was signed on 1 February.  Under the terms of the agreement, all existing arrangements regarding recognition of, and access to, social insurance entitlements will be maintained in both jurisdictions.  This means that the rights of Irish citizens living in Ireland to benefit from the social insurance contributions they have made while working in the United Kingdom and to access social insurance payments if resident in the United Kingdom are protected and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The agreement is subject to ratification processes in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, which are under way.  I confirm to both Deputies that the Irish Parliament yesterday passed the convention.  The convention on social security is in a resting period of 21 days within Westminster.  This resting period will finish on 19 March.  The United Kingdom's Privy Council will meet during this resting period to allow any submissions on behalf of Westminster parliamentarians to make towards the social security contribution and will be dealt with during the resting period.  We are still on track in this regard.  While I am confident that the process, having completed its passage here in Ireland, will complete its passage in the United Kingdom before 29 March, we must be absolutely certain that the current arrangements can continue even if all the necessary steps in the ratification process are not completed by that date.<\/p><p>That is the purpose of section 77.  The provisions of the Bill on this matter have been carefully drafted on foot of extensive legal advice to ensure we have absolute certainty about the making of social welfare payments in the event of a no-deal exit and the security of those payments.  Amendment No. 49 introduces a number of legal concerns and ambiguities around the process for the making of the necessary order.  This makes it unclear how the amendment would operate, what my obligations as the Minister would be in light of it, and what the D&aacute;il would be required to do.  My concern is that it would leave the process vulnerable to challenge and, in doing so, create unnecessary risks around the continuity and the certainty we are all looking to provide.  Furthermore, if our agreement is ratified by the United Kingdom Parliament by 29 March, as we expect, then the order envisaged by section 77 will not be needed in any event.  Therefore, it is not appropriate for me to be obliged as Minister to make such an order by replacing the word &quot;may&quot; with the words &quot;shall, with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; as, fingers crossed, it is to be hoped that the need to make the order will never arise.  It is for this reason alone that I propose not to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600017#P01100","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551873000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Progress reported;

Parents of both adults and children are exhausted and stressed and have been beaten down by the system and the absence of services.  There is a particular problem for children with disabilities who are being cared for by foster parents, as illustrated by the Ombudsman for Children.  Clearly, the Government lacks an appreciation of the crisis and its seriousness.  There is terrible inertia at the heart of the Government.  Service providers are told to make do with inadequate resources.  <\/p>  <p>  In the brief time available to me I will focus on the acute nature of the crisis for adults with disabilities and foster parents.  I will refer to a number of cases.  Peter is 19 years of age and has an intellectual disability and complex needs.  Respite care ceased for him at the beginning of 2015.  Home support has also ceased and in June there was no indication of any service for him.  His parents are at breaking point and worn out.  I have read the letters from the professionals.  The second case is a young man named John who will finish school in June.  He has a 2:1 staff requirement, multiple complex issues, severe autism and cab at times be prone to violence.  His parents have been told that there is nowhere for him to go when he finishes school.  Gerry is 57 years of age.  Unfortunately, the family carer who looked after him passed away late last year.  He has a severe intellectual disability, but there are no respite services available.  I have met the family and it is a devastating, complex case.<\/p>  <p>  The names I have mentioned are not the real names of the individuals concerned.  The next one is.  Ken Hurley is 49 years old and needs a full-time residential placement.  He has an intellectual disability and in the last year developed early onset dementia.  He is ready for discharge from Cork University Hospital where he has been for the last two months.  The family have been warned that they will have to pay &euro;1,400 per day if he remains in the hospital any longer.  His mother is 85 years old and he has lived with her all his life.  The HSE states he must go into a nursing home 70 miles away in Limerick.  <\/p>  <p>  I can give the Taoiseach more cases.  Se&aacute;n is 23 years of age, has autism and a 2:1 staff requirement.  His mother is an incredible person.  When she asked the HSE what would happen to him if anything happened to her, she was told not to worry as the HSE would look after him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600018#Q00800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1551873600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600018#Q00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1551873600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>In other words, if anything happens to the mother, the HSE will look after her son, but while she is there, it will not because it cannot.<\/p><p>I can illustrate more cases, as I am sure other Members also can.

The Government cares for people with disabilities and those who care for them.  We have made it a priority in the past couple of years to improve rights and services for people with disabilities.  I acknowledge that there is an enormous need and that there are many complex individual cases, with which we struggle.  The Deputy deals with them in his work as a public representative, as I do.  We do our best to resolve them as quickly as we can, but often they can be difficult to resolve, particularly where there are individual issues and they are very complex.  However, we are making a great deal of progress.  After many failed attempts by many previous Governments, last year we ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The budget for disability services is now &euro;2 billion.  It is a very big budget which was increased by &euro;150 million last year.  The Deputy is right that we should not just talk about global figures but also about what they mean in terms of their practical impact for citizens with disabilities and the people who care for them.  They mean, for example, that we are able to recruit an additional 100 therapists this year.  We anticipate that 20 of the 100 will be in place by April which will allow us to reduce waiting times for services such assessments of needs, for which people have been waiting a long time.  There is additional investment in respite care services.  This time last year we approved additional funding for 12 new respite care houses, of which ten are already open and providing respite care for 578 people.  That is very important because family carers get the break they need while the people for whom they are are in respite care.<\/p>  <p>  We extended access to the medical card to children with severe disabilities as a right, regardless of their parents' incomes.  In the past, when both the Deputy and I were in government, children with severe disabilities had their entitlement to a medical card assessed on their parents' income.  That has all changed and now 40,000 children with severe disabilities have the medical card as a right and their parents need not be concerned about earning too much for fear that their child might lose his or her medical card.  We have also changed how the disability allowance works to encourage people with disabilities who can work to enter the workforce, allowing them to keep more of the money they earn.  That is making a big difference in the number of people with disabilities who are supported to enter the workforce.  We have supported carers.  In a few weeks time there will be an increase in the carer's allowance.  It will fully reverse all of the cutbacks made in the past.  The carer's support grant has been fully restored, while last year we extended free general practitioner, GP, care services to those in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit as a right.<\/p>  <p>  I am running out of time, but that is just a sample of the meaningful practical actions that have been taken by the Government in the past couple of years.

Many people, not least in my own constituency of Donegal and in other Border counties, are incredibly angry about this.  The company with which I have motor insurance emailed all of its policyholders last month advising that we needed to apply for a green card if we plan to cross the Border or drive in Britain and that we needed to apply by the beginning of March.  I wanted to know how the process worked and if there would be a charge for the green card so I telephoned the insurance company.  I was to told to call back in a fortnight's time because they, just like the rest of us, did not know what was happening in regard to the green card process owing to the lack of certainty in regard to the outcome of Brexit.  The insurance company told policyholders that it will start issuing green cards after 29 March, when it is hoped a decision will have be taken.  I asked them what would happen to motorists on, say, 30 March who do not have a green card.  As far as people are aware, their cars can be impounded if they travel at that time to the North without a green card.  This is worrying for people.  A huge number of people are unaware of the implications of not having a green card.  People are angry that they will have to hold an international insurance certificate to travel across the Border.  For example, people who travel across the Lifford Bridge into Strabane on a daily, if not, weekly basis will have to have an international insurance certificate.  What annoys me, and most of the Irish public, is the fact that this matter has not been resolved heretofore.<\/p><p>According to the Motor Insurance Bureau in Britain, motorists do not need a green card for any European country, but obviously that will change post Brexit, and, more importantly, there a number of non-European countries in respect of which motorists do not need to have a green card, including Andorra, Serbia and Switzerland.  This shows that countries outside of the European Union have in place arrangements under which a green card is not necessary.  Given we have known for over two years that Brexit was going to happen, and given the sensitivities around the Border that have been at the cornerstone of our discussions in regard to Brexit, there are serious questions as to how the Minister, Deputy Ross, has allowed this situation to unfold, with hundreds of thousands of policyholders unaware of what is required in terms of a green card when we are just weeks away from a potential no-deal Brexit.  This matter should have been dealt with by way of bilateral agreement between the Commission and the British authorities such that the North of Ireland would be exempt from this scenario.<\/p><p>What role has the Taoiseach or the Minister, Deputy Ross, played in ensuring that this issue was dealt with before 29 March?

It is an issue that the Government is aware of.  It is one that we are is trying to ensure is resolved before 29 March.  The position is, of course, different in the two jurisdictions.  If there is a no-deal scenario on 29 March, Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, will no longer be covered by the EU motor insurance directive.  We will because we will still be in the European Union.  There will be differences depending on individual policies.

First, in a no-deal scenario, a motorist who crosses the Lifford Bridge post 29 March and does not have a green card could have his or her car impounded.  Second, a policyholder who is not covered to drive in that territory and is involved in an accident will not be covered in terms of insurance.  This could have been resolved.

This vital industry is at a critical crossroads because farmers are not covering their costs.  This cannot continue.  There are two contributing factors.  First, factories have a monopoly and are not paying farmers properly or fairly for the high standard of animals being produced and, second, not enough live exports are being sourced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or An Bord Bia, which would create competition for the factories and assist farmers in getting fair prices.  Farmers throughout the country, including in Kerry, are attending beef plan meetings where they are expressing outrage at the inaction of this Government.  They feel they are being neglected.<\/p>  <p>  Last week in this Chamber I highlighted the case of a Libyan buyer who was waiting more than three months for a visa so that he could come here to purchase more than 4,000 bulls worth &euro;5 million.  I welcome that, following my intervention, he received his visa, but it is too late because he has gone to Spain to do his business there.  I hope he will return to Ireland another time.<\/p>  <p>  The factories are applying ridiculous rules and regulations to trip up farmers.  In the case of the four movement rule, if it is shown that an animal has moved more than four times, the factory will reduce the price by &euro;40 to &euro;80, even though the quality of the beef is the same.<\/p><p>They will still kill it and sell it, and it is the same steak on the plate for the consumer.<\/p> <p> On the 30-month rule, there is no difference whatsoever between an animal at 29 months or 31 months.  If it goes over the age of 30 months, the price of the animal is again reduced by between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  If the animal goes over the age of 36 months, the price of the animal is reduced by &euro;200, while the price of bulls that go over the age of 34 months is cut by &euro;350.  The factories have databases.  They know when every animal was born, and when it reaches the age of 24 months, they will hold it up for a few weeks before selling it at the lower price.  The 70-day retention also hurts the trade.  We do not have enough lairages in Cherbourg to take the dairy-bred calves out of the country.  How is it that animals sell for &euro;200 a head more in the North of Ireland?  There is only a boggy ditch between us in places in the North and South of Ireland.<\/p> <p> The fifth quarter is the most serious aspect of what the factories are doing to farmers.  It is worth more than &euro;270 to the factory but farmers does not get one red cent of it.

At last Thursday's meeting, we heard from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of the current housing crisis and the related figures for 2018.  The Secretary General of the Department, Mr. John McCarthy, attended the meeting and, in reply to a question I posed, he stated quite categorically that the figures were clear for the breakdown of council properties, so-called turnkey properties, regeneration properties and rapid-build or modular homes, as they are known.  He went on to state the Department publishes quarterly updates in this regard and rejected allegations of spin in respect of the presentation of the figures.  According to the 2018 social housing output figures under local authority build, the number is listed as 2,022, but the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has bundled all of those categories and has consistently refused to give a breakdown of local authority build by individual category.  At the meeting of Committee of Public Accounts last week, however, in response to questions I posed, the Secretary General finally provided a breakdown of the figures for 2018.  There were 768 turnkey units and 200 regeneration properties, which leaves a total of 1,054 newly built local authority houses for 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Why was there a continued blurring of numbers by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  A number of weeks ago he appeared on \"Morning Ireland\" and, when asked for a breakdown, stated the figures would be available the following week.  They have yet to materialise outside of the Committee of Public Accounts, they are not on the Department's website, and they have not appeared in press releases.  On \"Morning Ireland\", Gavin Jennings grilled the Minister extensively and asked for a breakdown but those questions went unanswered.  The T&aacute;naiste and former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, stated at one point that the Department was the most transparent Department, and the introduction to the release of the 2018 figures makes strong claims as to its transparency, but we have received the very opposite of transparency.  Could it be that the reason for the reluctance to provide a breakdown of figures is that some individual councils are performing poorly?  It has been said that Dublin City Council, for example, which is at the epicentre of the crisis, built only 21 houses last year.  Could it otherwise be a matter of red tape?  We need to know.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach provide some straight answers to the following questions?

I do not know whether the incidence of autism in Ireland is increasing or simply if there is a better, more detailed diagnosis.  This is a significant issue for parents throughout the country.  At its heart is how the education of children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, is progressed in order that they can maximise their potential.  There is a complete lack of a clear career path for teachers, many of whom train at their own expense by taking courses to deal with children with autism.  There is no recognition of such training as a specific stream in education.  Whenever I have raised this issue, the Minister for Education and Skills has passed my questions to the Teaching Council which is locked into a tight model in which it only recognises four streams of teaching: primary, secondary, Montessori and other, and further education.  It is a rigid structure.  The Minister is washing his hands of the issue.  There is no mention of children with autism or particular special needs.  There is an intense need.  In my constituency there is a relatively high number of schools, especially at primary level but increasingly at second level, in which children are in ASD classes.  There is also broad agreement to develop an ASD-specific school in Dublin 15, Dublin 7 and Dublin West because of the numbers of children who are effectively in part-time education and, in some cases, not receiving education at all.  Even the Taoiseach has agreed that there is need for special provision.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to ASD classes, if teachers are taken out of the general primary teaching stream and received no specific training, notwithstanding their intense commitment to the children involved, it may not produce the best outcome for the children.<\/p><p>As a society we are all in the process of learning about this area.  We need to work out how we facilitate appropriate training for people who are going to take up positions as teachers in ASD classes or in ASD specific schools.  It is for the Minister for Education and Skills to provide leadership in respect of the Teaching Council.  I can understand that when the Teaching Council was established, this may have been an area which did not receive any particular attention.  That happens all the time.  Now that we know that this is an issue, we need to address how we are going to provide for recognition for people who have trained in the ASD area and how to provide the most appropriate and best education for children who have autism and ASD issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600021#T03200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551876000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I recognise the Deputy's advocacy over many years on behalf of those with special needs.  Inclusive education is a fundamental principle of our education and training system.  This principle is put into practice in the policies of the Department and the Teaching Council.  Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, all initial teacher education programmes in Ireland that lead to registration must have professional accreditation from the Teaching Council.  The mandatory requirements for accreditation are set out in criteria and guidelines for programme providers.  These were published in June 2011 and revised in March 2017.  Under these criteria, student teachers in all accredited programmes are required to undertake study in inclusive education, including special education.  This applies to all primary and post-primary teachers.<\/p>  <p>  The Department published Guidelines for Schools: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs for primary and post-primary in 2017.  These provide guidance to schools on the use, organisation and deployment of additional teaching resources for students with special educational needs, including students with autism.  In addition to developing and reviewing their whole-school policies in the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, schools should also be proactive in meeting the continuing professional development, CPD, needs of their teachers.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, support service delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support for teachers working with students with special educational needs, including autism.  Moreover, all of the Department's support services, such as the professional development service for teachers, are required by the Department to have regard to the individual needs of all learners in designing and delivering CPD for teachers.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the school setting, the Department's policy is that children with special educational needs, including those with autism, should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or in the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  The greater proportion of children with autism attend mainstream classes, but some require the environment of a special class or special school.  This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the National Council for Special Education.  The National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of special education needs organisers, SENOs, for the development, delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with special educational needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, they should update their local organiser to inform the planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600022#U00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1551876000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but it encapsulates the difficulties that happen for many parents and children in the current system.  I appreciate that people within the Department of Education and Skills and the Ministers are trying to improve the situation but it falls down in all sorts of ways throughout the country.  For instance, every year in recent years, as the Minister of State knows from his constituency, there is a panic when a child cannot find a place in a school which will accept the child because it does not have a special class or does not have the resources.  The child then has to go to the SENO, as the Minister of State said in his reply, who will provide support for the child.  That does not happen, and very often in Dublin 15, quite a few children are left with only a part-time or an inadequate education.<\/p>  <p>  From the point of view of people who want to teach children who are autistic or who are on the autism spectrum, we have to recognise this is a specialised area of teaching and that the current setup of the Teaching Council does not fully recognise this.  That is part of the problem.  If a principal in a primary school is allocated an ASD special class, does he or she select one of the existing staff to take that?  The teacher may be intensely dedicated, may want to do the best, may have voluntarily done courses but may not be particularly qualified in the area.  We have to up our game as a country in this regard because when the quality of education available to children with autism or on the autism spectrum improves, the outcomes for children and families are very good.

Inclusive education is a mandatory element of the initial teacher education programme, and research has been carried out on inclusive education in initial teacher education by the NCSE which recently published a report entitled Initial Teacher Education for Inclusion.  Phases 1 and 2 of the report found that there is in general much good practice in schools around their attitude to inclusion while also noting that there is scope for further alignment between theory and practice, in particular as between the student placement and the university experience.  The third point is that the Teaching Council is carrying out a review of the impact of the current programmes with a view to amending the criteria the Deputy spoke about and guidelines before the next round of accreditation commences in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Department provides a range of in-service professional developing supports to teachers.  The Deputy may not be aware of this but they have been in place since March 2017.

The review is of all the criteria we have spoken about.

It has been a very difficult year for beef farmers, particularly suckler beef farmers, throughout the country.  I was surprised with the reply I received last week to a parliamentary question I had tabled to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the operation of beef grading machines in meat plants throughout the country.  In the past two years, inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have found 21 beef grading machines to be working outside the rules set out for their operation.  Manual grading of carcasses was introduced immediately in all of these cases.  An interesting aspect of these figures is that even though 21 machines in meat plants were taken out of operation by the Department in the past two years, just four weighing scales were taken out of operation during the same period by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which regulates weighing instruments in all meat processing facilities throughout Ireland.  These figures are adding to the concern of farmers regarding the accuracy of grading machines.  This concern is compounded by the complexity of the beef carcass classification scheme itself.  With the development of technology, it should now be possible for farmers to be supplied with a digitised image of the carcass of each animal on the actual day of slaughter.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister, Deputy Creed, to seek to ascertain \"in the case of each of the 21 instances ... the number of carcasses that were rechecked by the manual grader back to the last known point of accuracy\" prior to the Department identifying the misgrading of those carcasses.  According to the reply I received from him, there is \"no mechanism to permit an officer to pinpoint exactly when the machine went out of tolerance\".  Control reports are done on a weekly basis by the supplier of these machines to the meat plants, but they do not report on the miscalculating of grades.  That is the standard set out by the Department here.  I find it interesting that in the UK, the rules dictate that the operator must check each machine daily and must keep daily control reports on the automated grading.  Those reports must specifically include any faults or inaccuracies, as well as the actions taken where necessary to address them.  In the UK, these machines are checked daily and inaccuracies are recorded.  In Ireland, one week's full kill of animals could go through an inaccurate grading machine where the grading is at least one if not more subclasses out in relation to that grade.<\/p>  <p>  What does this mean in plain English for farmers?  In the cases of the 21 machines I have mentioned, the miscalculation of grades was at least two subclasses.  I will give an example.  If a miscalculation causes an O+4 bullock to be graded as an O-4 bullock, the farmer will lose 18 cent on the grid and 12 cent on the quality assurance payment.  If it is an Angus animal, the farmer will lose 10 cent off the Angus bonus.  In the case of a bullock of average weight, &euro;139.60 would be taken out of the hands of a hard-pressed beef farmer.  I will give a final example.  If an O= animal is misgraded as a P+ animal, the 24 cent loss caused by the miscalculation will result in an overall loss of &euro;84 for the farmer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600023#V00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1551876600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this Topical Issue matter.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, is travelling to Turkey to discuss live exports with his counterpart in that country and he sends his apologies for not being here.<\/p>  <p>  There are 32 slaughter plants in Ireland, with mechanical grading being carried out in 23 of them.  Some 1.8 million bovines were classified in all plants in 2018, with 1.6 million of them being mechanically graded.  Commission implementing Regulation (EU) 2017\/1184 of 20 April 2017 governs the monitoring of carcass classification, presentation and weighing.  It specifies how on-the-spot checks shall be carried out in all slaughterhouses applying compulsory carcass classification.  According to the regulation, on-the-spot checks shall be performed at least twice every three months in all slaughterhouses which slaughter 150 or more bovine animals per week.  The regulation stipulates that each on-the-spot check shall relate to at least 40 carcasses selected at random.  In 2018, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine conducted almost 550 unannounced on-the-spot inspections in the 32 factories on carcass classification, presentation and weights.  There were 616 inspections in 2016 and 628 inspections in 2017.  This equates to an average of 20 inspections per factory per year, which significantly exceeds the legal minimum requirement of eight inspections per year.  The controls applied in Ireland are significantly in excess of those required under EU law.  These on-the-spot inspections are carried out by a dedicated team of specialist staff in the Department's beef carcass classification section.  The Department has been implementing further monitoring since 1 January last.  Since that date, the Department's veterinary public health inspection staff in the factories have been providing a supporting role for the beef carcass classification staff.  This should provide further assurance to stakeholders that the appropriate dressing specification is being applied in factories.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding grading checks in particular, the unannounced inspections verify the ongoing accuracy of the automated beef grading.  The mechanical classification method must operate within legally defined tolerances at all times.  The tolerances are defined in the EU legislation.  If the machine is found to be working outside EU-defined tolerances, the factory is instructed to revert to manual grading immediately.  The factory must then arrange for the machine to be serviced.  A classification check will subsequently be conducted by departmental officers to confirm the machine is within the legal tolerances before it is returned to mechanical classification mode.  All manual classifiers are licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  When manual grading is instigated, this is advised to farmers through remittance dockets.  Regional control staff ensure standardised and harmonised carcass classification procedures apply.  There are detailed procedures in place for the conduct of inspections and protocols for dealing with issues as they arise.  Standardisation exercises occur twice per year with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland, where the same classification machines are in use.  This is to ensure a standard approach to inspections throughout the island.  In addition, the EU Commission visits Ireland and other member states periodically to ensure there is standardisation across the EU.  I am satisfied that the controls carried out by departmental staff regarding carcass conformation, carcass trim and weights are fully in line with EU legislation.  I am also satisfied that there is a robust inspection monitoring and control system, with the number of inspections conducted well in excess of requirements set down in EU legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600023#V00300","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1551876600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I have absolutely no doubt that the standards that are being used here in the inspections comply with EU law.  That is not my question.  I am seeking to ensure the standards that are put in place are accompanied by a level of inspection that will protect the farmers who are supplying cattle to these plants.  That is what I am looking for.  Daily inspection reports are carried out in the UK.  The faults and inaccuracies are recorded and are available for inspection.  In this country, a compliance report is done once a week by the manufacturer of the machine.  These miscalculations are not recorded on such reports.  I mentioned an example in which a farmer could lose out on &euro;139.60, which is the difference between putting bread and butter on the table and not being able to do so.  Beef farmers have their backs to the wall at the moment.  We need to look at how we can protect them and not just at how we can comply with EU law.<\/p><p>Twelve months ago, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine supervised a trial of new grading technology.  Better cameras and other forms of technology were used to provide more accurate grading.  In this week's <i>Farming Independent<\/i>, Martin Coughlan points out that the current grading machines underscore both R and U grades.<\/p><p>In the two years after the introduction of mechanical grading in 2004, the number of R grades reduced significantly, by a sixth.  It is now 14 years since those machines were introduced, which happened three years before the iPhone first came on the market in 2007.  The machines are outdated and obsolete.  I believe we are undergrading cattle and taking money out of the pockets of hard pressed suckler farmers.  These machines need to be replaced immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600023#V00400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551877200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>The Deputy argued in his earlier contribution that it should be possible to have a digitised image of the carcass available to the farmer on the day.

In the UK they do daily checks, but are they with the new machines or with the old ones that we have here at present?  Information should be able to travel through automatic checks.  For example, a company based in Enniskerry in County Wicklow is able to monitor energy use in multi-storey buildings in Dubai.  They can switch on and off the heat via monitoring.  EirGrid does it and everyone can do it.  It is centralised control.  A company in Germany is in charge of it.  The increase in sophistication that has taken place since 2004 should allow ongoing monitoring.<\/p>  <p>  I urge everybody to come together.  We have set up a round-table group for a beef forum but people have decided not to engage with it.  We need to get everybody around the table for transparency in order that we understand the systems of grading and pricing.  That must include producers, processors and retailers.  Everybody should understand.  I favour having a sophisticated grading system on which everybody has eyes.  Health and safety does not allow an owner of animals to follow them down the line the way it used to be done years ago.  There has to be another way of doing it.  We should be aiming to get there and that is the purpose of having a forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600024#W00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","time":1551877200,"counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600024#W00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1551877200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Roscommon is getting a good look in today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600024#W00400","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1551877200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Indeed, on two very important issues.

We have seen the protest from the doctors and the concern expressed.  It is no different in the constituency of Roscommon-Galway.  One general practitioner based in the constituency has been asked to take on additional patients, as many doctors have been, from the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, panel appointments.  Recent protests have highlighted the ongoing pressures being placed on GPs throughout the country.  This particular GP in my constituency is unfortunately not unique.  His practice is operating at full capacity and there is now a three-day waiting list for his surgery.  His existing patients are deeply frustrated by the situation.  Despite this, a number of additional patients have been assigned to him by the PCRS.  His practice nurse has been on maternity leave since December and he is having serious difficulty in sourcing a full-time nurse and has not been successful to date.  As a single-handed GP who also took patients from the emergency reception and orientation centre, EROC, in Ballaghaderreen, he should be excluded from patient appointments in his panel.  He has been asked to take on new patients on a regular basis over the past two years due to a number of issues such as Brexit, people relocating to the west and people coming back to the area to work.  There was already extraordinary pressure on this GP prior to the arrival of patients from Syria.<\/p>  <p>  As for the EROC, despite the promises from the Government and the Department of Health, no new resources or funding were allocated to the Ballaghaderreen area to support the existing health services, and now we can see the fall-out.  If this GP takes additional patients, they will more than likely end up being assigned to another GP after six months.  GPs are entitled to ask for patients to be moved on if they cannot handle the situation.  This would be very frustrating for the doctor and the patients, particularly in a place like Ballaghaderreen where a doctor and his staff genuinely took on the people from the EROC, gave a fantastic service to those people and continue to do so without any assistance from the Department.  He is still not able to do it and he is totally frustrated.  I have a copy of a letter from the HSE telling him that another family is coming.  I am not going to give the details here but I have them on file if the Minister of State wants to see them.  This is happening on a constant basis and it is not fair to him.<\/p>  <p>  The doctor writes that the HSE contacted him last year to take on a family that was moving to the area from the Mosney centre and was being settled in the town of Ballaghaderreen.  He says he was unhappy at the time due to the fact that this placed an even greater burden on the surgery but, once more, he accepted the new patients.  He states that he thinks this is very unfair as there were already extraordinary pressures on the surgery prior to the arrival of the patients from Syria.  He writes that his practice provided a GP service to those vulnerable patients and that it was the proper and Christian thing to do.  That is what the GP wrote in a letter to me.  It is clear that there was extraordinary goodwill to help less fortunate people.  He never closed his door on them.  However, when people now look to make an appointment, including patients who have been with him for years, in most cases he cannot take them until the following week.  Where there are EROCs and direct provision centres and doctors are being asked to take on these extra patients, I ask that we do something for them because no back-up has been given to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600024#W00700","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1551877200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I assure the House that the Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity.  The goal is to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  GPs have a crucial role in the provision of primary care services.  Particularly in rural areas, local GPs play a vital and ongoing part in the lives of most people in the community.  I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and supported and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified doctors.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that there are two General Medical Services, GMS, GPs in Ballaghaderreen.  In addition to their medical card and private patients, these GPs provide care to refugees in the emergency and orientation centre in Ballaghaderreen.  While neither of these GPs has GMS panels exceeding the maximum number of patients permitted under the GMS scheme, the HSE is aware that they are under pressure to provide such services but has not been made aware of any particular difficulties in this regard.  Local HSE management in Roscommon is committed to liaising with the two GPs on an ongoing basis in respect of the provision of services to patients in Ballaghaderreen. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of workforce issues generally facing general practice, including the influence of demographic factors, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice.  These include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible or shared GMS GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday.  Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.  There has been a huge expansion in the number of training places on GP training programmes in recent years.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places available and in 2018, 193 places were filled, an increase of approximately 60% over this nine-year period. <\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are many challenges in general practice.  That is why the Government remains committed to engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS contract.  Talks between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation as the established GP representative body are continuing.  Agreement on the delivery of these service improvements and contractual reforms has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multi-annual basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600024#W00800","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1551877200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for a fairly comprehensive reply.

They constantly look after them and provide services to them.  They do it because they say it is the Christian thing to do.  I ask that the Minister of State bring the message back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, that when people from places like Syria are brought into direct provision centres, we must provide the locality with some extra services.

One such piece of news concerns the potential moving of the HSE's adult community mental health team from Clondalkin to Tallaght due to difficulties with the current premises, and the second is the proposal to merge the young persons' mental health support service, Jigsaw, which would result in the loss of that service to its current base of north Clondalkin.  It is proposed that the service move to Tallaght.<\/p><p>The Clondalkin drug and alcohol task force has written to all of the Deputies in the constituency to raise several concerns.  In terms of the adult mental health team, it has said:<\/p><blockquote>The removal of front line services, even on a temporary basis, to a location outside of the community will increase the barriers for those already faced with adversity to access services.  As it stands, the taskforce says, the community mental health team are already under-resourced and work with the most hard to reach service user group who require ongoing support to address their mental health needs.<\/blockquote><p>On Jigsaw, the task force has said: &quot;The removal of services in an area where there are significant issues in terms of mental health for young people and adults, which is supported by research from the National Suicide Research Foundation and the National Office of Suicide Prevention, would have catastrophic implications for the community.&quot;  The task force is urging the Minister of State to work with the four local Deputies in the first instance to ensure that neither of these services are lost to the local community and that Jigsaw retains a permanent base in north Clondalkin to provide the services for the surrounding areas.  North Clondalkin in particular, because of a range of factors, has a significantly higher level of suicide and mental health issues for younger people than many other parts of the country.  Jigsaw is one of the most wonderful services imaginable.  I am sure the Minister of State has been in Jigsaw services in other locations.  It is accessible to young people in the local area and has built up a reputation of trust and confidentiality.  People can just walk in.  They do not have to be referred by a GP or other formal services.  In fact, even Deputies and members of the community can make referrals.  There is a strong view among people working in mental health services and in the local community that the loss of these two crucial adult and young person facilities will not just mean a loss of services but could also result in the loss of lives due to the inability of people to access crucial mental health supports.<\/p><p>In the first instance I am urging the Minister of State to outline what his Department can do to ensure that these services are not lost to Tallaght.

Importantly, however, there is no intention to reduce the number of front-line staff.  The intention is to make the service more stable, sustainable, flexible and accessible to young people.  Any inference or misinformation about the service being reduced or taken away is inaccurate and is indeed quite unhelpful in that it may cause uncertainty for young people and their families or those considering reaching out.<\/p>  <p>  The main hub for the integrated service will be a new, larger premises in Tallaght.  Jigsaw will still operate from the existing hub in Clondalkin for at least the remainder of this year, after which it will be looking at other premises or co-location options so that it ensures both a presence and accessibility across the full catchment area.  Jigsaw has moved to reassure everyone involved by putting out &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; messages on its social media.  Jigsaw has also provided certain reassurances to local community agencies and to elected representatives.<\/p>  <p>  The service, currently based on Moorefield Avenue in Clondalkin, is not closing.  Jigsaw is currently exploring options for service delivery into south County Dublin around their new premises in Tallaght for this service from 2020 and beyond.  It remains fully committed to the young people of Clondalkin and surrounding areas and will continue to deliver mental health services to them and their families.  Any decision to change the physical location of the service will be made in line with Jigsaw&rsquo;s desire to continue to offer the best it can to the people of Clondalkin and surrounding areas.  The new premises in Tallaght will bring together the Jigsaw Clondalkin and Jigsaw Tallaght teams, thus creating one larger, more resilient team to ensure stability and sustainability into the long term for the service to the county.<\/p>  <p>  In line with trends across Jigsaw&rsquo;s network, the last twelve months have seen a 15% surge in demand for its services in Dublin south west.

The Deputy knows that the budget for mental health services is &euro;1 billion, with an additional &euro;55 million being allocated this year alone for new initiatives.  Since becoming Minister of State my focus has been on supporting and enhancing mental health services such as Jigsaw.  They are the real winners.  We are trying to move people away from the specialist upper-end services.  For that reason, in the past 12 months we put 114 assistant psychologists to work in the community, with 20 psychologists and ten advanced nurse practitioners for young people.

Next year we will look at possible co-location in premises in Clondalkin, but we absolutely intend to maintain a service in Clondalkin.

Deputy Brady spoke about fuel allowances.  Simply, the overlapping provisions included in the convention replicate the current arrangements and reflect the general rule that a person should not receive two payments in two jurisdictions.  That issue needed to be addressed in the legislation.  There is no provision in the convention or the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill which will change the existing practices in the making of fuel allowance or other payments.  All of the current arrangements will stand.  I think the Deputy was under the impression that somehow we had changed something.  I confirm that all existing payments and the current arrangements will continue.<\/p><p>In respect of the Department of Work and Pensions' winter fuel repayment, it is an annual tax repayment made to eligible people to help towards meeting their winter heating costs.  In most cases it is a lump sum payment of between &pound;100 and &pound;300 and paid automatically in November and December.  Since the winter of 2012-13, people living in the EEA or Switzerland who have a genuine and sufficient link with the United Kingdom have potentially been eligible to receive the winter fuel payment, regardless of whether they previously had an entitlement to receive it.  Obviously, that still stands.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Dea asked why the draft heads, as published, were different.  They were intended to provide the power to make regulations to deal with a range of issues such as the treatment of events or facts occurring in the United Kingdom; the taking into account of social insurance contributions paid in the United Kingdom; the habitual residence condition; the avoidance of multiple payments; arrangements regarding absence from the state; arrangements for frontier workers where the frontier crossed will be between the United Kingdom and Ireland; the exchange of information; and the arrangements to ensure the maintenance of current payments <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the United Kingdom and where the current arrangements governed by EU regulations are more expansive than the existing bilateral arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>As the drafting process progressed, the construction of the amendments changed significantly, although the overall aim and ambition remained exactly the same.  In particular, a more streamlined approach was adopted based on the strong advice of the Office of the Attorney General which will effectively allow me to treat the agreement we signed on 1 February as if ratification had occurred in the event that ratification has not been completed by the United Kingdom by 29 March.  An order has also been drafted to give effect to this provision, if required.  This is an unusual provision, but it is possible to make it because the agreements have been signed and the United Kingdom has retained the provisions of the relevant European regulations in its domestic legislation.  As a result, most of the provisions originally envisaged and as set out in the heads of the Bill are not required, but we will all achieve the same aims.  Obviously, regulations will need to be placed before the House.  The Deputy asked me if the same was true of the order.  The order will only give effect to the convention which has been approved by the House.  <\/p><p>The Deputy also asked me about our interactions with other EU member states.  All other EU member states are covered by the EU Regulation No. 883 which will continue to apply.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked if pensioners in Ireland would continue to receive their UK pension payments into their bank accounts.  We make payments to pensioners who reside outside the European Union and the EEA into their bank accounts and will continue to do so.  The United Kingdom is currently part of the geographical scope of the single euro payments area, SEPA, scheme owing to its EU membership.  It facilitates the payment of UK pensions into Irish bank accounts and that will continue.  As the geographical scope of the SEPA scheme already extends beyond the European Union and the EEA, including to several third countries and territories, the option remains that the United Kingdom will continue to be included in the scope of the SEPA scheme, provided it fulfils the eligibility criteria.  I genuinely expect it to continue to operate under the SEPA scheme.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Dea asked me for a list of schemes that will fall under the reciprocal arrangements.  They are the contributory State pension; carer's benefit; health and safety benefit; illness benefit; treatment benefits; adoptive benefit; maternity benefit; paternity benefit; invalidity pension; partial capacity benefit; widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension; contributory guardian's payment; occupational injuries benefit; widow's or surviving civil partner's grant; jobseeker's benefit; child benefit; the back-to-work family dividend; non-contributory guardian's payment; domiciliary care allowance; one-parent family payment; and working family payment.  For every scheme available in both countries today, our ambition is to provide for continuity after 29 March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600026#Y00600","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1551878400,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Before the debate was adjourned this morning, I asked a question that the Minister has not answered.

The Minister is saying that because this may not actually happen, she may not have to do that and therefore the word \"shall\" would be inappropriate.  I tend to agree with that.

The convention is not open for amendment.  It is open to being either ratified or rejected.  If it is rejected, then obviously the legislation we are discussing will kick in for the security of Irish pensioners living in the UK and all of those other recipients to ensure that the arrangements will continue to function.  From the various and copious meetings and discussions that we have had over the past 18 months with UK Department for Work and Pensions officials, their teams and their Minister - indeed this is the second Minister in that office - we want to maintain what we have always had.  There is no doubt in anybody's minds that what we have agreed has been agreed by both sides.  The Privy Council will sit this week and next week to allow people to express observations and make comments and statements on this matter, in the same way that we would do here.

I am disappointed that my amendment has been ruled out of order.  I believed it was perfectly reasonable and related to the section and purpose of the Bill.  I will outline it when I seek further clarification on the decision made.<\/p>  <p>  Extradition plays an important role in east-west and North-South policing and the justice area and there must be provision for it if the European arrest warrant will no longer apply in the context of a hard Brexit.  It is right and proper that there be further integration and co-operation in dealing with justice and security matters now than ever before.  Some of it is based on international conventions, but the majority is based on EU infrastructure.  Unfortunately, it may be eroded substantially and we saw an example this morning.  In the event that there is a hard Brexit, the Brussels II agreement on the mutual recognition of family law arrangements will no longer apply.  I understand a number of other conventions, including the Hague convention, will cover that situation, but there is the possibility of divergence further down the line.  This concern needs to be addressed as a wide number of areas will be affected.  The Minister has stated he will deal with some of them by way of statutory instruments, but in this area primary legislation will be required.<\/p>  <p>  Even though it is not yet in force, we could have benefited from mutual recognition of probation judgments and decisions on probation and community service.  Unfortunately, the new EU proposal which we are transposing into Irish law will not benefit those who are convicted and given a sentence that involves probation in the North, for example.  They will not be able to serve their sentence in the South if resident here.  It also applies east-west.  It will not be possible to apply that proposal because it is not law, but will the Minister seek bilateral arrangements with Britain for mutual recognition once it becomes law in order that such provisions will apply?<\/p>  <p>  This section relates to the Extradition Act 1965 which was based on a 1957 Council of Europe convention.  Section 8 of the Act can apply where the State has made an agreement with a country that is a signatory to a convention to which the State is also a party, for example, the 1957 convention.  This section of the Bill which amends the Act will ensure that provision applies to Britain post Brexit and takes account of more efficient and up-to-date electronic means for processing applications.  We will not oppose it.  However, our amendments sought to ensure this legislation would remain up-to-date in the context of any change in compliance with human rights provisions in other European jurisdictions.  All continental European countries, with the exception of Belarus, are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, which has been defined as a key value of Europe and is frequently referenced in EU literature, even though it is a Council of Europe document.  The British Government's current position is to rule out withdrawal from the ECHR, but that has not always been the position of the Conservative Party.  Many of its members would have Britain renounce and exit from the convention.  We need to take this into consideration, provide for it and ensure Irish legislation will be robust enough to be revised if what I have described happens and the standards of human rights protections in the United Kingdom or any other European country recede because of a desire to reduce such protections.  The same concern extends to every area in which there is mutual co-operation, including refoulement.  If there is a departure from the ECHR, it will have profound implications for Ireland, particularly on a North-South basis, in compliance with the highest human rights standards.<\/p>  <p>  For the moment the British Government has dropped what was the clearly stated policy of the Conservative Party, to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998, replace it with a British Bill of Rights and eventually withdraw from the ECHR.  Repeal of the 1998 Act under which the ECHR was transposed into UK law and requires British judges to take decisions of the European Court of Human Rights into account has been a stated aim of the Conservative Party for over a decade.  It was clear in the party's manifesto in 2010, as was its commitment to withdraw from the European Union.  In 2014 the party published its proposals for a British Bill of Rights to replace the Act.  After the 2015 general election, the then Secretary of State for Justice, Mr. Michael Gove, promised proposals in that regard.  At one stage the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, favoured renouncing the ECHR, as did Mr. Gove and several other senior Conservative leaders.  It is not the current position of the British Government, as I am sure the Minister will say, but we cannot say that will remain the case.  In that context, we must be willing to review Irish legislation on and procedures for co-operating with the United Kingdom and ensure they will be kept up to date.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that our amendments have been ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 52 reads: \"Where a European Country, notifies the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, under article 58 of the European Convention on Human Rights [under which it is required to give six months' notice] ... the Minister shall immediately initiate a review of this legislation, which shall be concluded within 4 months\".  That would have provided an additional window to take urgent legislative action.  Obviously, the amendment will not be moved, but I hope the Seanad will be able to discuss an amended version.  This is an important matter and in this and other respects we must watch Britain's compliance with the ECHR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600028#AA00900","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879600,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and advise the House that in this Bill we are dealing with a no-deal scenario which would be the worst outcome of Brexit.  We are dealing with what I describe as a catastrophic no-deal Brexit across a range of areas.  As has been said numerous times, all sides of the House hope this legislation will not need to be relied on.  It is in that context that I acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's remarks.  I note the Deputy's references to various Conservative Party manifestoes under different leaders while in opposition and in government.  It would not be helpful to speculate further, but I am satisfied that there is no imminent plan on the part of the British Government to depart from the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>It is important for us to deal with the possibility of a no-deal scenario rather than entering into the realm of speculation.  That said, I listened carefully to what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said and of course, in the event of there being a sudden change, this House would be happy to have an appropriate engagement.  At that stage, I would welcome, as always, the contribution of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire but dealing with the here and now, the pre-29 March situation, I acknowledge the hope that agreement will be reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  <\/p> <p> One of the key issues identified is to ensure that there are effective extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK in the event of a no-deal scenario.  The European arrest warrant will no longer apply to the UK and at 11 p.m. on 29 March, persons detained on foot of such a warrant would be released.  It is critical, therefore, that extradition provisions are in place immediately following the UK's departure from the EU, at 11.01 p.m. or as soon as possible thereafter.  Following detailed examination of the options available for extradition arrangements in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the optimum solution is to apply the 1957 Council of Europe convention on extradition to which both Ireland and the UK are parties.  While I readily accept that the extradition procedure under the convention is neither as effective nor as efficient as that under the European arrest warrant, as I am sure Deputies will agree, the convention is the best means by which we can provide a workable solution.  The intention would be to legislate for and move towards an extradition arrangement with the UK that is similar to the European arrest warrant.  I acknowledge that there are differences between the surrender procedures under the European arrest warrant and the extradition procedure under the convention.  The 1965 Act, for example, does not permit extradition of own nationals unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide.  The Attorney General has advised that clear provision should be made in section 14 of that Act so that the ban on extradition of own nationals should not apply to Irish citizens in reciprocal circumstances where requesting states also extradite their own citizens.  Section 14 of the 1965 Act is being amended here to ensure that the current European arrest warrant arrangement in relation to extradition of own citizens continues and that, in applying the provisions of the convention, extradition of an Irish citizen will be permitted on the basis of there being a reciprocal arrangement, where the law of the requesting country does not prohibit the surrender of its citizens.  The UK has already indicated that it intends to continue to extradite its citizens after Brexit and while I acknowledge the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, I would suggest that they are best dealt with when the circumstances as outlined by the Deputy arise in the future, although I do not envisage that happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600028#AA01000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551880200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The Government's proposed amendment of section 14 of the 1965 Act is appropriate and regrettably, necessary in the context of us facing a no-deal Brexit.  One of the great achievements of the EU has been the European arrest warrant, which enables countries to apply for the extradition of persons from other countries in order that they can be held accountable for criminal acts that they committed in the requesting country.  It has worked very effectively throughout the EU, particularly in the United Kingdom.  One of the big losses to the United Kingdom when Brexit happens, particularly a no-deal Brexit, is that it will be outside the European arrest warrant system.  This reveals the artificiality of Brexit because no doubt, when it comes to negotiation with the EU on the future relationship, the United Kingdom will insist on being part of or having a relationship with the European Union which is similar in effect and substance to the current European arrest warrant system.  There is no reason for the UK to want anything less and no reason to think that it would benefit from seeking anything less.  We are going to go through this artificial scenario whereby the United Kingdom announces that it is out of the European Union but in fact, it wants to avail of many of the successes of that Union.  Had the political leaders in the UK made an effort to praise the achievements of the European Union, such as the European arrest warrant, the people of the United Kingdom might not be as blinded to the benefits of membership of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  If there is a crash-out Brexit, the 1965 Act will be amended.  One of the principles of extradition is that there must be reciprocity, that is, the requesting country must be able to extradite its own citizens.  I was informed by the Minister at a committee meeting last week that this has happened already in the UK.  The law there has been changed and citizens of the UK can be extradited to the European Union, including to Ireland, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Since that arrangement is in place, it is appropriate that we should amend section 14 of the 1965 Act in accordance with what the Government is proposing.  It is also a requirement in respect of extradition that the offence for which the request is being made is also an offence in the country from which extradition is being sought.  That is a fundamental principle which is also set out in the 1957 convention.  It will apply here too.  In general, criminal offences in Ireland are similar to the criminal offences that are on the Statute Book in the UK.  There are some differences but ultimately when a request for extradition is made, it is clearly in respect of an offence that is an offence in Ireland, even though it may have been committed in the UK.  The section is appropriate but hopefully we will not have a crash-out Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  I note what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said in respect of the European Convention on Human Rights and I agree with him that there is a strong strain of political thought within the British Conservative Party that wants to get Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In fact, in advance of the referendum in 2016, although the current Prime Minister of the UK was in favour of remaining in the EU, she did suggest that it would be appropriate for the UK to opt out of the aforementioned convention.  Many of the people in England who object to the European Court and its influence on British politics are actually confusing the European Court of Justice, ECJ, with the European Court of Human Rights.  If one were to ask, just after the referendum, whether the UK would be anxious to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights, the answer would probably have been \"Yes\".  However, now that the reality of what Brexit involves is becoming clearer to those who advocated leaving, there is a recognition that there is much more to this process than simply getting Britain out of European agreements.  Brexit has consequences for the UK, as we can see in respect of the European arrest warrant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600029#BB00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551880200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551880200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Section 87 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551880200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>SECTION 88<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551880200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 53 to 55, inclusive, are out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600029#BB00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551880200,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 53 to 55, inclusive not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551880200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 56 to 58, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600029#BB00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1551880200,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 56:<\/p><blockquote>In page 68, line 21, to delete &ldquo;<b>3A. <\/b>A person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<b>3A. <\/b>(1) A person&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>I will deal with the amendment first and then make some more general points on the section.  These amendments relate to an issue that was discussed at both the committee briefing and in the Chamber on Second Stage, namely, the changes that are required to the <i>non-refoulement<\/i>consideration.  <\/p><p>That followed on from a case in 2018 that required a more formal provision to be put into the legislation and a statement that all deportations since December 2016 had been subject to a <i>non-refoulement <\/i>consideration.<br\/><br\/>In many jurisdictions the courts with international human rights mechanisms have given a much more expansive interpretation of what should be involved in the prohibition on <i>refoulement <\/i>than has been considered in this Bill or legislation to date here.  Other jurisdictions, for example, have required considerations of other serious human rights violations such as in the following: the flagrant denial to a fair trial, as in the European Court of Human Rights case of Othman (Abu Qatada<i>) v<\/i>. United Kingdom; serious forms of sexual and gender-based violence such as in the Convention Against Torture, Njamba and Balikosa <i>v<\/i>. Sweden, 2010; the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women general recommendation No. 32, paragraph 23; and female genital mutilation as provided for by the Human Rights Committee in Kaba <i>v. <\/i>Canada, 2010, and as recognised in the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, general recommendation No. 32.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that heightened consideration must be given to children in the context of <i>non-refoulement<\/i>, whereby actions of the state must be taken in accordance with the best interests of the child.  The commission states: &ldquo;In particular, a child should not be returned if such return would result in the violation of their fundamental human rights, including if there is a risk of insufficient provision of food or health services.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Incorporating this provision into this section of the Bill would make the legislation more human rights compliant.  It would not act as a prevention to deportations but it could be a further set of considerations of potential very serious breaches of a person's human rights before his or her deportation.  That is the purpose of this set of amendments and the reason we have tabled them.  It is a very reasonable ask.  I refer to potentially very serious human rights breaches that the State should take into serious consideration before it deports anyone.  It is correct that heightened consideration should be given to children in this context.<br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in had tabled amendments Nos. 53 to 56, inclusive, in this section 88.  These amendments related to the legislative uncertainty that cannot be solved only in this House but which can be partially solved here around the citizenship rights of those who are born on this island but are resident in the Six Counties in the North.  There is a lack of legislative clarity in this regard.  On Second Stage I quoted Mr. Gormally from the Committee on the Administration of Justice:<\/p><blockquote>Legislation is needed both in the UK and Ireland to recognise the particular status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland and their unequivocal right to participate fully in that region and as fully as feasible in Irish society and full equality in the rights the two categories can access.  A treaty enshrining these provisions in international law would repair the damage done to the principle of the Agreement.<\/blockquote><p>This issue has been well flagged and the Government should reflect on it and should have considered amendments in this regard.  I hope the Government will consider quite seriously some of the amendments we have put forward.  It is a clear view, shared by many academics, that a change is needed not only in British legislation but also in Irish legislation.<br\/><br\/>The Sinn F&eacute;in amendments would have amended section 62 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act to guarantee full citizenship rights for those who fall under that section, the citizens to whom we refer.  There would also be a need for a review to make recommendations as the legislative changes that are required to give full and equal citizenship for the Irish citizens in the North.  There are issues around naturalisation and seeking visas, for example when people are related to or a spouse of an Irish citizen but are not themselves an Irish citizen, where that Irish citizen is resident in the North.  When a partner who lives in another jurisdiction wants to come to Ireland and a visa is sought for him or her, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will not give that visa.  The Department will send the person to the British system.  This needs to be rectified.  These are rights that Irish citizens should enjoy wherever they reside.<br\/><br\/>At the heart of this debate in recent weeks we have had most notable contributions on this.  For some time we have seen all stripes of political opinion doing their best to show their interest in this and a desire to be open to and take into consideration the rights of citizens in the North.  We see Fine Gael looking to run Mark Durkan in the EU.  We see Fianna F&aacute;il and its partnership with the SDLP.  We see increased commentary from the Labour Party on politics in the North.  This is all absolutely welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600029#BB00800","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551880800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Fantastic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600030#CC00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1551880800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Central to that, however-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600030#CC00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1551880800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The Deputies' spots never change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600030#CC00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1551880800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>The Deputy, without any interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600030#CC00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1551880800,"counter":412,"content":"<p>The Minister can elaborate on that.

It is the heart of the approach that has been taken by these Houses.  These are no small matters and Sinn F&eacute;in sought to table amendments to address these.  There are clear deficiencies in legislation with regard to the citizenship rights of those in the North, the rights to Irish nationality of those who live in the North, and where it relates to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956.  These deficiencies have been identified, not just by Sinn F&eacute;in but also by the Committee on the Administration of Justice, by Queen's University Belfast academics, by academics in the South, and by a whole plethora of people.  This needs to be resolved.  I do not believe it needs to be a matter of dispute but clearly there is a view that there is an absence that this Bill has not addressed.  It will not be addressed unless the Minister tables amendments.  My amendments are not able to get through the system so I appeal to the Minister to give this further consideration before it goes to the Seanad, and to table amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600030#CC00800","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1551880800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>There are two issues I wish to develop.  The first is on the amendments before us and the second is that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire spent more time in his contribution addressing the amendments that were disallowed rather than on the others, but I am anxious to reassure the Deputy.<\/p><p>The provisions in sections 88 and 89 are inserted for the purposes of correcting what has been something of a lacuna in <i>non-refoulement<\/i>considerations.  It is the practice of not returning a non-national to a country in which the person is liable to be subjected to persecution or where the life, liberty or freedom of the person is at risk under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996.  It applies to persons subject to that Act and to persons removed from the State under the Immigration Acts 1999 and 2003.  The introduction of the International Protection Act 2015, which repealed the Refugee Act 1996, somewhat inadvertently removed the legal basis providing for <i>refoulement<\/i>in the Acts of 1999 and 2003.  As was brought to my attention recently by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, the High Court case S.G. (Albania) <i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality identified issues of an administrative nature.<\/p><p>These relate to the enactment of the 2015 legislation, the transitory provisions relating to the 1996 Act and the domestic legal basis for consideration by the Minister of the principle against <i>refoulement<\/i>.  The court identified that the Minister's reference to the legal basis for the prohibition of <i>refoulement<\/i>was incorrect and these issues have existed since 31 December 2016.  The importance of that date is that it was the day on which the lacuna inadvertently arose on the commencement of the 2015 Act, a consequence of which was the repeal of the 1996 Act, including the <i>non-refoulement<\/i>position of section 5 of that Act.  I wish it to be clear to the House that it has remained policy and practice to apply the principles of <i>non-refoulement<\/i>to all removals from the State in conformity with our constitutional position and our international obligations.  Nonetheless, I accept that, of course, legal certainty is required in this area.  If there is a lacuna, it must be recognised, admitted and corrected as a matter of priority.  The purpose of sections 88 and 89 is, therefore, to restore the position that there is a certain legal basis for the <i>non-refoulement<\/i>consideration for all persons being removed from the State, not only in the protection area, but in respect of all deportations and refusals of permission to enter the State.<br\/><br\/>I listened carefully to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on the matter of his amendments and have noted them.  I am concerned that what they propose is inconsistent with the definition of <i>non-refoulement<\/i>applied under section 50 of the International Protection Act 2015.  That definition was carefully considered and debated in the House when the legislation was before it.  It is based on the principles of international law and encompasses very serious issues, including some of those referred to by the Deputy.  Having regard to that definition and in view of the fact that advice was sought from the Attorney General, it is unnecessary to include forms of sexual and gender-based violence or female genital mutilation, as these matters are already covered by the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.  As for the proposal to go further and include in the definition the flagrant denial of a fair trial, I assure the Deputy that this already comes within the scope of the definitions as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights.  It is, therefore, neither a necessary or appropriate test.  For these reasons, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.<br\/><br\/>I accept the importance of the citizenship issues raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in respect of amendments which are not being considered by the House.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is conscious of the issues and is working to maintain full access to EU rights, opportunities and benefits for Irish and, therefore, European Union citizens in Northern Ireland.  That has been clear from the outset of the Article 50 negotiations under the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I stress, importantly, that Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland will continue to be citizens of the European Union and enjoy the right to move freely and reside throughout the Union.  They will, of course, benefit from the important right not to be discriminated against on grounds of nationality while so doing.  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that we will engage actively to ensure people in Northern Ireland enjoy continued access to European Union rights, opportunities and benefits into the future.  There is also an onus on the UK Government to protect fully the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire recalled some of the commitments which have been made in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600030#CC00900","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551881400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 56 to 58, inclusive, are unnecessary.  Sometimes adding more words to a statutory provision has the effect of narrowing the meaning of that provision.  There is a general assumption that the more words one uses, the broader the definition becomes whereas, in fact, it can become narrower.  I am concerned that were we to add to section 3A the words suggested by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, it could narrow the provision.  In any event, the amendments are unnecessary as they replicate what is there already.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire wants to include at the end of section 3A(b) the words \"flagrant denial of a fair trial, serious forms of sexual and gender-based violence and\/or female genital mutilation\".  Serious forms of sexual and gender-based violence and female genital mutilation are recognised by all of us as torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and, as such, they are already covered.  The flagrant denial of a fair trial is covered by the proposed section 3A(a) which refers to threats to the life or freedom of a person.  As such, there is no necessity to amend section 88 as suggested in amendment No. 57.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 58 seeks to provide that the \"Minister shall give heightened consideration to children in the context of non-refoulement, whereby actions of the State must be taken in accordance with the best interests of the child\".  I am concerned about including in legislation a requirement for a Minister to give heightened consideration to a particular aspect of it.  That implies that there are different levels of consideration to be given by a Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, might be asked how different his consideration of a particular application was to the heightened consideration he was required to give it.  It does not create a reality.  When the Minister is carrying out his statutory functions, he should give consideration to matters.  I assume that every Minister required by statute to give a matter consideration gives that matter serious, or what could be termed \"heightened\", consideration.  If we include in the Statute Book requirements that Ministers undertake different levels of consideration, we will get into significant trouble because of provisions it will be claimed require Ministers to give slight consideration to certain matters.  That would probably become the defence of the Executive in due course.  I understand what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is trying to do but it is not necessary.  For that reason, I do not support the three amendments being put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raises a very important point about the status of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland.  We had a very good hearing at the justice committee recently on that particular issue.  It is a matter of very serious concern and it underpins the agreement reached some 21 years ago in Belfast when it was recognised that people in Northern Ireland who saw themselves as having an allegiance to a unified Ireland or, indeed, the Southern State, were entitled to do so.  That was recognised in the establishment of new institutions as well as by way of a recognition that those people could achieve their self-determination if the majority of people in Northern Ireland wished to do so.  Similarly, an arrangement was made whereby the unionist population of Northern Ireland saw the Southern State withdraw its territorial claim.  At the same time, unionists in Northern Ireland recognised that if the majority of people there wished to join a unified island, they could do so.  All of that was premised on a recognition by both sides that they were members of the European Union and shared the great benefits of that membership.  In fact, the European Union brought people on this island together to a greater extent than any other entity on the island since we gained independence.<\/p><p>It was a major success in bringing people together on the island.<\/p> <p> Although Irish citizens in Northern Ireland have the benefit of their EU citizenship through their Irish citizenship, there is a difference between residing and not residing in a European Union country.  When Irish citizens from Northern Ireland travel abroad within Europe on an Irish passport they have all the benefits of European Union membership in the same way as somebody from the South who travels abroad, but it is different for them when they live in Northern Ireland.  We have been unable to tease out the real consequences for Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland.  The justice committee recommended that a forum be established to examine the rights of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and how their EU rights will necessarily be affected.  Obviously we should do as much as possible to ensure that Irish citizens living outside the European Union in Northern Ireland have the full benefits of membership of the EU.<\/p> <p> It is also important to point out that a significant number of people living in Northern Ireland who do not have Irish citizenship and carry British passports also wish to retain the benefits of membership of the European Union.  The failure to remain in membership of the EU will have a transformative effect on the politics of Northern Ireland.  All of us should try to get away from viewing the North of Ireland in terms of green and orange.  As is the case in other parts of the world, politics in Northern Ireland is changing.  Old tribal loyalties are not retained and people are becoming much more cosmopolitan in their political choices.  As Northern Ireland experiences the downside of no longer being part of the European Union, people's political choices in Northern Ireland are going to change.  We should allow that to evolve while at the same time trying to ensure that Irish citizens there have their rights fully respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600031#DD00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551882000,"counter":419,"content":"<p>There are several strands to the issue of rights, but two primary strands.  One is the rights that people stand to lose in the context of a hard Brexit or, indeed, any Brexit.  The second is the rights in which there currently are deficiencies even in advance of Brexit.  I have given two examples of that in respect of naturalisation and visas, but other absences have been clearly identified.  There is a view that a bill of rights would be of significant assistance in that regard, but it requires legislative change in the South as well.  We will consider if there is any way we can table amendments in the Seanad.  However, there was a commitment in the context of Brexit not to leave northern citizens behind again.  To be true to that, the Government must accept, and I hope the Minister will accept, that there is a need for legislative change to validate and affirm the rights of citizens living in the North.  I hope that will be progressed in short order, and I ask the Minister to do that.  It is what is required to be consistent with the commitment not to leave northern citizens behind.<\/p><p>Regarding the responses to the amendments, I will respond first on the additional considerations.  I do not believe they are restrictive by any means.  They take a further set of grounds into consideration as well as the others that exist, including inhuman and degrading treatment, as Deputy O'Callaghan outlined.  They are necessary and are in line with developments in the last seven or eight years in the major conventions, such as the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and with what the UN is saying.  These would not have necessarily been part of standard jurisprudence before that.  They are emerging areas and I am not sure Irish legislation has kept up to date with that.  I believe we should and I will press the amendment.<\/p><p>With regard to heightened consideration, we already give heightened consideration to people in different circumstances.  We put a heightened consideration for children into the Constitution.  In many respects we give heightened consideration to people in vulnerable circumstances, people who might have a disability and so forth.  We regularly give heightened consideration to people depending on their circumstances, and it is entirely appropriate.  If we are going to send a child out of Ireland because the child did not qualify under the <i>non-refoulement<\/i>test that currently exists, it is entirely appropriate to say that we wish to take a heightened look at the case and to consider it very seriously before sending the child back to what might be an extremely hostile environment.  There is nothing unreasonable or inconsistent in requiring a heightened consideration where a child is involved, based on the child's best interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600032#EE00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1551882000,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I stress to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that we are dealing with this legislation solely in respect of the consequences of a crash out or a no-deal Brexit.  We are looking at putting together a comprehensive contingency plan for that scenario.  From the outset of the contingency planning, the need to ensure the protection of the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement was clear to the Government throughout the process.  Indeed, that was not just a priority objective of the Irish Government but also an objective of the European Union as a whole.  It is important to acknowledge that.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure of the extent to which amending Irish citizenship laws can have the desired effect that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire believes is possible.  I am not sure of the extent to which we can legislate in respect of part of the United Kingdom.  I would prefer to continue the process of dialogue, North-South and east-west, that has been expressly arranged under the Good Friday Agreement and to continue the engagement between the European Union and the United Kingdom to ensure that access to all the rights and benefits of the European Union will be preserved for the people of Northern Ireland.  That is a far more positive means of achieving that objective than by attempting to legislate or changing our legislation.  It is an almost unique position for the European Union to have a body of people who will be EU citizens not living within the European Union.  Perhaps there is a similar situation in parts of Moldova as far as Romania is concerned.  In any event, the Government is particularly conscious of this matter, and whether it is a no-deal, hard-deal or soft Brexit, Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland will continue to be European Union citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I will not accept the amendments for the reasons stated earlier.  I would be happy to pursue the important issues raised regarding citizenship, but they are not particularly relevant to this legislation nor can they be dealt with satisfactorily in this legislation.  However, they certainly can be dealt with through the process already arranged in the Good Friday Agreement and consequent agreements.  Regardless of what happens regarding the form and scope of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, we will continue to engage in a way that is fully protective of our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600032#EE00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551882000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551882000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 57:<\/p><blockquote>In page 68, line 28, after &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; to insert the following:&ldquo;, flagrant denial of a fair trial, serious forms of sexual and gender-based violence and\/or female genital mutilation&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600032#EE00500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551882000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551882600,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 58:<\/p><blockquote>In page 68, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;(2) The Minister shall give heightened consideration to children in the context of non-refoulement, whereby actions of the State must be taken in accordance with the best interests of the child, a child should not be returned if such return would result in the violation of their fundamental human rights.&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600033#FF00100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"vote","time":1551882600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 33; N\u00edl, 83; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Donnchadh \u00d3 Laoghaire and Pat Buckley; N\u00edl, Deputies Se\u00e1n Kyne and Tony McLoughlin.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600033#FF00200","aye":["1238","1252","1361","1279","1253","1258","1288","1303","1266","1353","1349","1299","1345","1242","1362","1333","1226","1280","1302","1325","1215","1269","1287","1370","1366","1327","1301","1294","1276","1222","1367","1232","1355"],"nay":["1368","1246","1219","1321","1332","1272","1310","1354","1293","1369","1220","1307","1350","1335","1241","1273","1357","1218","1255","1336","1263","1221","1339","1286","1217","1364","1261","1352","1338","1436","1292","1274","1356","1322","1300","1214","1341","1441","1233","1313","1251","1360","1319","1237","1249","1365","1229","1314","1311","1224","1244","1337","1359","1347","1223","1290","1343","1247","1284","1283","1262","1295","1342","1315","1328","1228","1296","1297","1267","1329","1278","1324","1265","1231","1334","1304","1213","1344","1270","1277","1250","1236","1358"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551883200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Sections 88 to 91, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 59 to 67, inclusive, which insert new sections, were proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.

I wish only to make a short intervention about important issues that we sought to include in the Bill by amending and strengthening it.  We had a number of engagements with the T&aacute;naiste and his officials.  Deputies across the House have been supportive of the passage of the Bill, as demonstrated by the fact that we have almost finished.  Nobody has sought to delay the Bill in any way.<\/p><p>The Bills Office grouped the amendments into this new section 92.  That was not our doing.  The amendments deal with substantial issues that go to the heart of many of the difficulties which will impact on Ireland in the event of a hard crash.  They impact deeply for the people that we represent, North and South, especially in the North but also in the Border counties.  We tabled an amendment that would put a responsibility on the Irish Government to establish an all-island forum on preparing for Irish unity and that that forum would sit for a period prescribed by the Minister with people appointed by the Minister.  That body would report to the D&aacute;il and allow the D&aacute;il to formulate a White Paper on Irish unity.<\/p> <p> A comment was made by the leader of the SDLP, who said there would be a cold place in hell for people who call for a Border poll but do not have any idea of what that united Ireland would look like.  That was disingenuous, given that we have been screaming from the rooftops at successive Irish Governments for years to plan for Irish unity.  We called for the establishment of an Oireachtas committee to deal with it.  We now call for this forum and we have called on the Government to bring forward a White Paper.  The purpose of the White Paper is to do precisely that.  It is to outline the steps necessary to bring about Irish unity in a Border poll.<\/p> <p> All of this is in the context of a hard crash.  If there is a hard crash out of the European Union by Britain, that means the North coming out of the European Union as was acknowledged earlier.  That raises serious questions about their rights as European citizens but it also raises serious issues for the Border.  We would have a European frontier on the island of Ireland, with the North out of the customs union and Single Market, yet there are no provisions in this Bill and we do not expect this Bill to deal with these issues.  Of course it could not.  There is no provision even to deal with the most logical outcome to make sure that we avoid any hardening of the Border, that is to end the Border and partition once and for all.  All of the opinion polls in the North and the South show that, in the context of a hard Brexit, a majority of people in the North and South would vote for a united Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister to be cognisant of that and to understand where people in the North are coming from.<\/p> <p> Another amendment which was ruled out of order and which is important to people in the North is that, while they will have certain protections afforded to them as a consequence of the common travel area and from this omnibus Bill, they will not have political representation.  It is no good for Fine Gael to say that it will put forward a candidate from the North and that that person will represent people in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600034#GG00600","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cullinane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":433,"content":"<p>This is relevant to the Bill from our perspective.

That includes unionists as much as nationalists.  A majority of people in the North voted to stay in the European Union and it was a dereliction of duty and responsibility by the Irish Government not to make any attempt to provide for the political rights of citizens in the North.  They will end up in a situation where even if the withdrawal agreement goes through, as we hope, and the backstop comes into play, they will be in the customs union and Single Market for all intents and purposes, but they will not have any ability to impact those rules.

There is a difference of approach in the context of calls for a Border poll between the Government and a number of parties in this House, and the approach that Sinn F&eacute;in has taken.  We need to recognise that people's aspirations for the future, for this island, for relationships North and South and for constitutional change are all legitimate.  That is politics and it is catered for comprehensively in the Good Friday Agreement with regard to how decisions may be made in the future and the process that would trigger that.<\/p><p>I have spoken on many occasions, as have the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, the Taoiseach, and others, about the enormity of the issues we are trying to deal with and that we are trying to protect and maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>as well as we can with regard to rebuilding institutions linked to the Good Friday Agreement, functioning devolved government and functioning North-South co-operation.  Brexit has had an extraordinary polarising effect on political parties and communities in Northern Ireland.  I attended a reconciliation conference in the national convention centre yesterday and we were reminded of that.  To put the setting up of a forum on national unity into the mix at this time as a response to Brexit moves us away from where we need to be, which is to try to find accommodation of each other and to reassure people of all backgrounds and identity in Northern Ireland that what we are trying to do through Brexit is to protect the peace agreement and what has been hard-won over the last 21 years, and to find a way to get functioning government and political decision-making in Northern Ireland.  That is not to dismiss people's legitimate aspirations for the future, whether unionists, nationalists or something else.<\/p><p>I do not think introducing a legal requirement for the Government to set up an all-Ireland forum to prepare for Irish unity in the context of the challenges we are facing this week, next week and for the next number of months is either helpful or sensible.  While this amendment has been ruled out, which is nothing to do with me, if it had not been ruled out, I could not have recommended accepting it.<\/p><p>With regard to representation in the European Parliament, one reason why my party has asked Mark Durkan to stand for us is to try to ensure that there is a perspective from Northern Ireland in the European Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH00700","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":438,"content":"<p>There are three Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH00800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":439,"content":"<p>This should not be party political.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH00900","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":440,"content":"<p>The Minister is making it party political.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH01000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I am not making it party political.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH01100","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":442,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH01200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Please let the T&aacute;naiste finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":444,"content":"<p>This is all out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH01400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1551883500,"counter":445,"content":"<p>It is all out of order but I said I would respond briefly to it.  We have looked at ways in which we could potentially think about representation in the European Parliament.  When a country is an accession country, in the lead-in to joining the European Union, it often has observer status in the European Parliament.  We have looked at that issue.  I have raised it at Cabinet and elsewhere.  There are real practical difficulties in doing what the Deputy is proposing, which is to set up a constituency for Northern Ireland, because Northern Ireland will be outside of the European Union.  Whether one attaches voting rights to EU citizens, that is Irish citizens, and not British citizens, is something that the Deputy would have to think about very carefully with regard to consistency with the Good Friday Agreement and the principles of non-discrimination and so on in it.  This is not an easy issue to resolve and we should not pretend that it is.  I do not think that this legislation is the place for it.<\/p>  <p>  While I am on my feet, I will say that this all relates to Part 15 of the Bill.  Part 15 is very different to the rest of the Bill.  The other 14 Parts are essentially about triggering a legislative response to a no-deal Brexit, should that happen.  Part 15 is the opposite.  It is about ensuring that if there is a withdrawal agreement, Part 15 would be commenced, which would effectively consider the United Kingdom as a member state for all intents and purposes for the transition period in the withdrawal agreement.<\/p><p>It will initially be a two-year period, unless the United Kingdom asks for an extension of one or two years, should it be needed.  It is important to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>through the transition period to effectively consider the United Kingdom as a member state in terms of its treatment and consistency with EU directives, rules and regulations, for everything from trade to standards and so many other areas.  That is what Part 15 does.  It is the only section of the Bill that will actually take effect and be commenced if there is a deal.  If there is no deal, the rest of the Bill will apply.  There are no amendments to Part 15 that are in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600035#HH01500","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551884100,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 59 to 67, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1551884100,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I am not going to allow a debate on amendments that are not in order.

We have been constructive and reasonable the entire way through, but I remain critical of the time allocated for the process.  We would have liked to have had more time to consider the Bill in advance of the process beginning.  It has put pressure on to have amendments made quickly because there are just 24 days to go to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill does not cover every issue that needs to be covered.  I appreciate that not everything can be legislated for and that some issues will be dealt with through statutory instruments.  We await more details of what will be done through secondary legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In the wider context of Brexit it was disappointing to hear yesterday that there had been no breakthrough in Brussels between the UK team and Michel Barnier and his team.  My understanding is much will hinge on the advice the UK Attorney General, Mr. Geoffrey Cox, may give to Parliament in the coming days.  He has made it clear that he will not change his advice of last November that the withdrawal treaty, as drafted, will trap the United Kingdom in the backstop.  That is not the intention, but nonetheless that was his advice which he was forced to publish.  If he does amend it, I understand it will be published.  If it is published and amended to the extent that the backstop is temporary, we will have to react to and assess it when it happens.  The phrase about the need for t he sun, moon and stars to line up comes to mind when we see the task ahead of the British Prime Minister in that there appears to be a reliance on the Attorney General's advice changing to a significant degree that will allow the backstop to be seen to be temporary.  That will allow some hardline Brexiteers to come on board, with perhaps the Democratic Unionist Party and some Labour Party members, which together might facilitate the passage and ratification of the withdrawal treaty which they negotiated.  <\/p>  <p>  We, on this side of the House, want to see a deal done.  We are very concerned that there are just 24 days to go and a deal has not been ratified.  The legislation passing through the House will go before the Seanad next week is positive.  That is because of all the work done across the House by every political party, with the exception of Solidarity and People Before Profit.  Every other party and Independent Member has done what it, he or she can to get the legislation through and should be commended on the work done in that regard.  I commend all of the civil servants and the Minister's team, including those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who have worked extremely hard to bring the Bill to this point.  If there is a crash-out Brexit and no deal on 30 March, we are not prepared for it.  The situation will be calamitous and there will be a direct hit on business, farming, supply chains, the price of sterling and peace and stability on the island.  There is a lot of work to be done.  The Bill is only one of many elements in the preparations the Minister who is leading for the Government on this issue needs to do to prepare the country for the worst possible impact of Brexit.  There will be no shortage of support on this side of the House for whatever the country needs to do to get ready for it.<\/p>  <p>  Our minds are on the negotiations in Brussels.  We await the legal advice that may come from the United Kingdom with anticipation to see what the additional offerings from the European Union may look like and what status they may be given.  In that regard, my party will assess developments as and when they occur.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to address the House at this important juncture of the Brexit process.  It is only the beginning of what we need to do.  I urge the Minister to step up preparations, particularly for business and farming, because we are not as prepared as we should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600036#JJ00700","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1551884100,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister and officials in a range of Departments on the various briefings they provided for Oireachtas Members.

I still think a crash-out Brexit is the least likely outcome, but it is a possibility that would have devastating consequences for the island of Ireland.  I hope there will be something better and that we can arrive at an arrangement with Britain under which it can stay as much as possible in the customs union and the Single Market.  We have always said that is the best way to resolve the issues for Ireland.  It would prevent a land border and a border in the Irish Sea.  That is the best way to protect the interests of people in Britain and Ireland, but that is now a matter for the British Prime Minister in considering her red lines.<\/p><p>We sought to strengthen the Bill, but many of our amendments were ruled out of order.

It has presented challenges which have been overcome.  The negotiation of the withdrawal agreement was complicated.

I love the acronym &quot;BOB&quot; that has been coined to describe the Brexit omnibus Bill.  We hope that as an omnibus Bill, it captures all the issues that might arise in the event of a hard Brexit.  We all hope there will not be a need to face the implications for the nation, and indeed for the island of Ireland and the EU as a whole, of a disorderly UK departure.<\/p><p>For more than four decades, the UK's relationship with the EU has bound it intrinsically into the legal structure of the Union.  During the referendum, people advocated the notion that it would be simple to bring this relationship to an end, as if it were like leaving some sort of club.  We have not yet foreseen all of the extraordinary difficulties that will, regardless of the eventual outcome of this process, ultimately be caused by the UK's decision to extricate itself from everything that has been completely integrated for more than four decades, including trade, business, finance, laws and environmental controls.  I have no doubt that we will have to revisit issues that we thought we had agreed on and dealt with.  Equally, I have no doubt that issues which have not yet occurred to us will arise and need to be addressed.<\/p><p>As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, I raised two broad issues in the course of the debate on this Bill.  The Labour Party did not table any amendments on Committee Stage because, in essence, it did not want to bolt anything onto the Bill.  There was nothing fatal in the Bill that, in our judgment, needed to be amended.  The first issue I would like to return to is the constitutionality of vesting powers in the Minister for Health to change primary legislation.  The Minister has given me very strong assurances, reinforced by the views of the Attorney General, that the idea of this provision is simply to preserve the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It is not new.  We will see.  I hope it is robust.<\/p><p>I will return briefly to a second issue.  I have yet to comprehend fully how we will deal with the UK differently in relation to the General Agreement on Trade in Services without being required to give exactly the same treatment to every other non-EU member state that is bound by the same general agreement.  As I have said, these things will play out if and when they need to be played out.<\/p><p>I would like to reinforce some questions I put to the Taoiseach this week.  I genuinely believe we are now in the endgame of finding the solution that is going to be found to provide for the type of withdrawal from the EU that the UK will have.  I do not want to sound alarmist when I say this is a point of heightened peril for us.  It is unfortunate, if perhaps inevitable, that the backstop is the issue that is presented as causing the final and insurmountable obstacle to a majority in the House of Commons supporting the negotiated withdrawal agreement.  The Attorney General for England and Wales is in Brussels again this week to find a legally binding way of changing his advices.  I do not believe he will compromise himself by giving advices he does not believe.  If he is to change his advices, it is self-evident that he will need to have something that he can convince his colleagues in the House of Commons marks a fundamental change.  It seems to me that this could be arrived at in a number of ways, most of which have already been ruled out.  My understanding is that everybody, including the British, agrees and understands that there can be no change in the withdrawal agreement itself.  That is a closed shop.  I had thought there might be some amendment to the political declaration, but I now understand that is not the way.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste can advise us on that.<\/p><p>What other means are there?  There was speculation yesterday that there could be a new arbitration system.  If Britain determines at some stage after the triggering of the backstop agreement that it wants to withdraw, is it envisaged that some third party arbitration will take place?  If so, I do not understand the impact it would have.  Would it diminish the bulletproof guarantees we currently have?<\/p><p>The final way of doing this would be the way we dealt with the post-Lisbon treaty situation, when a declaration was made by the Council of Ministers and the legal services of the Council determined that the declaration had legal validity.  In our case, it was subsequently added as a protocol to the Lisbon treaty.  Obviously, that had legal certainty.  If the avenue that is sought is a legally binding declaration, without question it will undermine the robustness of our guarantee.  I have not yet got my mind around how Mr. Cox is to be satisfied without weakening the guarantee that cannot be weakened.  I would welcome an answer to that question.  I understand that the T&aacute;naiste probably does not know the full answer to it.  Perhaps he will give his understanding of where the negotiations are at.  I read yesterday that they have returned to the tunnel, which is always a worry.  There is a code of silence around these discussions.  It is too important, sensitive and critical to our well-being and that of our people on the island of Ireland for it to remain in some Brussels tunnel.  I would like to hear more on this.<\/p><p>The Bill we have been dealing with in recent days is a legislative response, insofar as such a response can be crafted, to a disorderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  As every other Member of the House has strongly underscored, the legislative response is just one arm of the comprehensive response we need to give.  I am still very concerned about the level of investment in ports, for example.  I have visited Rosslare and I know about the congestion that will be caused there.  I am looking at the impact of the minor work to rule that is going on in France today.  If the UK landbridge fundamentally breaks down and is so slow as to be unusable for some types of goods, there will be a lack of robust connectivity between Ireland and the Continent.  There is an unquestionable concentration of dependency on Dublin Port, through which 90% of the imports and exports of this State are now channelled.  All of these things cause me concern, as do other issues like supports to small and medium-sized enterprises and the agriculture sector.  I will raise those matters at a different time.<\/p><p>I look forward to the speedy passage of the legislation and our further debates as we move towards whatever will happen by the end of the month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600037#KK00200","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551885300,"counter":462,"content":"<p>It does not surprise me that the legislation has moved through the House as quickly as it has.  The main purpose of the Bill is not controversial; it is to maintain as fully as possible the <i>status quo<\/i>in the common travel area to avoid disruption.  No sane or sensible person in this Chamber would want to cause unnecessary disturbance or massively disrupt the <i>status quo<\/i>, particularly in the areas covered by the Bill such as electricity supply, health, transport and education services, education programmes for students and so on.  Who would want to see such disruption?  That is why I find Deputy Lisa Chambers' little barb utterly bizarre.  As much as anybody else in this House, we want to avoid disruption and unnecessary arguments.  We put forward a few amendments where we thought the legislation could be strengthened, but most of them were ruled out of order.  We made a point about our disappointment about this, but we have not slowed the passage of the Bill.  It was unnecessary politicking for no good reason.  It was disappointing but perhaps not terribly surprising.<\/p><p>I was surprised, as was Deputy Cullinane, about the ruling out of order of some of our amendments.  I conveyed our disappointment to the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.  The objective of the Bill is to avoid disruption in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit.  Our amendments sought to include a firm statement and an assurance that if things were to unravel and there was a no-deal Brexit, something we hope will not happen, we would set down a clear statement that there would be no hard border and that we would not entertain one.  In a no-deal scenario we will not entertain pressure from anybody, whether in Britain or the European Union, to erect a border.  I still think that amendment should be included.  While these are all important issues to be dealt with to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>, everybody knows that the discussion in the next few weeks will all turn on what will happen if there is no deal and whether there will be a hard border.  I am not saying the other matters do not affect people; they are important.  <\/p><p>I commend the civil servants and staff of Ministers.  Even if the Bill is not politically controversial, it is technically difficult.  There was a lot of work put into it and I commend those who did that technical but important work.  However, the big issue confronting us is what will happen if there is no deal.  We all hope there will be one.  In the House and private conversation the Minister has said there will have to be hard conversations.  There certainly will.  Perhaps he sees it as a necessary tactical negotiating position not to get into that matter too much at this point.  However, there are certain things that he needs to say.  Pressure will be exerted if that is what transpires eventually.  We have to say we are not submitting to that pressure.  In the end it is other people's problem if that happens.  Whatever issues they may think are important - the Single Market or anything else - they are not as important as peace on this island.  It needs to be stated clearly that under no circumstances will we risk that danger.  <\/p><p>On the crazy politics that is driving the Tory right and the Brexiteers, the little Englander nationalism, we are very much focused on its English manifestation because it is impacting directly on us.

It is a failing of politics generally in the western world.  We have also seen it in the United States.  While we have to deal with a very immediate problem and the consequences of Brexit, we should not imagine, whether it resolves itself for the better or worse, that the threat posed by dangerous xenophobic right-wing nationalist politics is going to go away.  It is not.  It is a serious threat and we need to think about from where it is coming.  We must ask what has failed in politics that has led to that type of politics in the first place.  I welcome the decision I believe Fine Gael has made to call for Mr. Orb&aacute;n to be expelled from the European People's Party.  We have been advocating this for quite some time.  Beyond that, this type of politics is very dangerous and we need to think about from where it is coming.  It is not good enough just to condemn it; we also have to ask to what problems is it giving rise.<\/p>  <p>  I do not understand why a couple of things are not being done in the Bill.  I do not see why we would not deal with the issue of UK driving licences being accepted here.  That was the subject of one of our amendments which were ruled out of order.<\/p>  <p>  I think most Members of this House would say they were in favour of a united Ireland, although they would differ on how we would achieve it and when.  We are in favour of a Border poll.  It is possible to make a purely democratic argument for it, given the possibility that there could be a hard border and how it could change minds.  However, it is our view that we will never achieve a united Ireland through a sectarian head count.  That is the kind of politics that leads people into entrenchment.  Where we can win is by putting forward our common interests, the things that unite people and undercut sectarian division.  That is why, in the aftermath of the overwhelming popular power in favour of repeal which was a youth and women-led movement and which, like the movement in favour of marriage equality, has spilt massively into the North, we have proposed that there be a new basis to unite people across the sectarian divisions in the North and the South and elsewhere.  Lots of young people from the North came here to canvass for repeal.  After the referendum, lots of people from the South were in the North to march for a woman's right to choose.  That is why we said it would have been a good idea for the Government to make provision in the Bill or state elsewhere that abortion services provided free in the South would also be provided free for everybody in the North.  That would have been a massive gesture in showing real solidarity that could begin to lay the ground for unity.  That is part of the bigger political debate on the future of politics on the island.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the passage of the Bill, but the big questions remain unresolved.  It is critical that we say to Britain, the European Union, the World Trade Organisation and anybody else that a hard border will not be tolerated because peace on this island is far too important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600038#LL00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1551885300,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600038#LL00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1551885300,"counter":466,"content":"<p>As a Border Deputy and a newcomer in this House, little did I think in February 2016 that we would be debating an omnibus Bill on the issue of any country exiting the European Union.  It is the catalyst for dramatic change on these islands.<\/p><p>I thought it would be important that I contribute to the closing of this debate.  I will start where Deputy Lisa Chambers left off, in that I am sure that quite a number of issues have not been debated.  I raised particular concerns during the week, but I have no doubt that those concerns will be dealt with by various statutory instruments.  People in my constituency are asking questions on this and that point and I encourage the Government to participate in as many bilateral meetings as possible, if necessary before exit day.  If further legislation is required I am sure it will come before this House. <\/p> <p> I commend not only the preparatory work undertaken by officials and others, and the co-operation of political parties in this House in terms of the delivery of this omnibus Bill, but indeed the whole process itself.  Regardless of what political party one is involved with or what involvement people had through the process, whether involvement in the civil dialogue or the break-out sessions, we did not take our hands from the tiller.   We might criticise the level of preparedness or the level of debate or engagement but we did not lose track, unlike many others who thought that this issue was going to go away.  Whether there will be a D-day, decision day, exit day or May day, I still say we should beware the Ides of March.  The public are fed up listening to us talking about Brexit.  They do not realise we might end up with two different time zones, as has been mentioned in recent days.  There could be a 4% to 6% reduction in GDP, together with an increase in consumer prices of up to 30%.  The public will know then why we have spent so much time talking about Brexit. <\/p> <p> We have been engaged in a game of who will blink first, or Russian roulette.  I am reminded of the Kenny Rogers song, as some people are \"on a train bound for nowhere\", and there comes a time when people need to know when to fold and to hold.  These islands will be on a backwards trajectory unless people come to their senses.  In my view, the natives of the Border area are growing restless, and many of the reports in recent days suggest we could go back to the bad old days. <\/p> <p> There has been a lot of debate about the green card.  I am old enough to remember that this was not just about having car insurance.  People talk about the common travel area but I remember when it was not a case of one's car being insured but was a question of whether one would be able to bring one's car or lorry back, where one had to have one's vehicle bonded upon leaving the jurisdiction.  I am too long in the tooth and I remember what it was like in the bad old days for our economy - I am not referring to the Troubles - and it is time that people come to the realisation in all Houses, be they North, South, east or west, that these islands need to work collaboratively and to take a step back from that ultimate brink. <\/p> <p> We should not have spent the last two years talking about \"no deal preparation\", or NDP, but rather about the NDP that is the national development plan and how it will have an impact in this country into the future.  While we may not have wasted two and a half years, we certainly have not been debating the issues that the people believe are more important than the Brexit debates we have had.  These debates have not got down into the nitty-gritty involved, and probably will not until we reach the cliff edge.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600038#LL00600","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551885900,"counter":468,"content":"<p>We did not seek this legislation but we have to enact it.  Like other speakers I congratulate all the Members of this House who made a solid contribution to the united stance the Irish Government took on this issue.  We did not waver once or change tack.

Once alternatives are created one begins to lose ground, and once that ground is lost, more concessions are inevitable, until one is in a place one does not want to be.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Ministers of State and the officials involved, as well as the leaders and members of the opposition parties.<\/p>  <p>  This is a sad event, which cannot improve the situation that prevailed heretofore.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to a failure of politics.  Politics has not failed.  People get impatient with it, as they get impatient with democracy.  This is not the first time this has happened.  For 30 years we heard that politics had failed in Northern Ireland.  It failed because it had been pushed to one side and different methods were introduced that were not beneficial to the country, democracy or peace.  The same happens elsewhere in the world.  This is not the first time we have seen swings to the hard right or the hard left.  Both sides have come together in common cause, and it did not benefit the world at large either.  Whenever that happens, there is always a cause.  In the past it has happened as a result of economic unrest, when people wish to point the finger of blame at someone.  The most recent occasion on which that happened was the Second World War.  Free-thinking, decent, honest and constructive people turned around and pointed the finger of blame at their neighbours, blamed them for what was happening and decided to punish them.  It was done in such a dramatic way that the world will never forget it.  We should always remember that 70 million people were annihilated as a result of those antics.  When it was all over, from the ashes the European leaders of the time vowed that it would never happen again, and set about creating the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community, and the European Union.  Those leaders did well; to do so in that environment at that particular time took a great deal of hope and perseverance and required a great deal of confidence in the future.  Those leaders are well known, and we remember them.  They put in place the foundations for modern Europe, and did it extremely well. <\/p>  <p>  New people have come along and said that they disagree with how things are.  They have decided they want to go back to the old days.  I asked recently what old days they are talking about.  I presume they are referring to the first half of the 20th century, which was marked by those infamous wars.  Is that something we should aspire to return to?  The common cause that people reached at that time was to kill one another.  I do not think we should go there, I do not think we will and I sincerely hope we do not.  <\/p>  <p>  Nigel Farage has been a major architect of this debate since the very beginning.  He sneaked in after the Battle of Agincourt, and I believe he changed sides.  He has been working steadily since.  Britain, Europe and Ireland have inherited something from that man that is not in any way constructive or useful.  We certainly cannot build the future of Europe on it, or the future of Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Like the T&aacute;naiste I am strongly of the opinion that now is not the time to have a debate about a united Ireland.

I have no doubt it will eventually prevail with the co-operation, help, support and confidence of all the people of this island.  That is particularly important to the business sector, North and South.  Over recent years the two parts of this island have become to a great extent dependent on each other.  Any intervention in that area will not make it easy for populations on both sides.  It will not make it easy for the economic performance on either side.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that the British people will come to the conclusion that what we had for the past 60 years or so in terms of European unity with peace and harmony is a hell of a lot better than anything that will be achieved otherwise.  I hope they will have an opportunity to vote again.  The previous referendum was non-binding, but the degree to which the result has been adhered to in the meantime, one would think it was binding.  However, it was a non-binding referendum, as referendums there are.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously the politicians who supported that position at the time - I will not go back to my friend, Nigel Farage, again - do not want to have a second referendum because unless they got the same decision a second time, they will look very poor in light of things that are unfolding.  If a second referendum is held, I see nothing that would convince me other than that the decision would be reversed.  Many business people, investors and people whose jobs are in jeopardy are now talking in a way they did not previously.  They have information they did not have at the time of the original referendum.

So much of what we have achieved in these negotiations has been due to the absolute support of our member state colleagues in the European Union.  I therefore did not think it was appropriate to cancel my visit to meet foreign and European ministers in Lithuania and Latvia.  I reassure colleagues that support from the Nordic, Baltic and all member states is as strong as it was two and a half years ago when this process started.<\/p>  <p>  I regret that we are here discussing this legislation.  In saying that, I thank all the Deputies, as have the T&aacute;naiste and many others, for their support and co-operation.  We have clearly shown as a Parliament that while we might have our political differences in outlooks and opinions, we can come together to represent the people on this island and ensure that their rights, businesses and livelihoods and the peace on this island can be and will be protected.  We have shown that clearly through the passage of this legislation as quickly as we have.

It would have been premature to introduce it before this stage because our primary focus has always been to ensure we had an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, and that remains our focus.<\/p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste rightly said when introducing this legislation, we hope it will sit on the shelf and never need to be used.  Irrespective of that, irrespective of the outcome of the next couple of weeks, and irrespective of whether we have a deal, which we hope we will, Brexit means change.  The UK will become a third country in terms of trade, customs or otherwise.  It is incumbent on everybody to look at how it how it might impact on their lives, their businesses, their livelihoods and their industries.

The Government's and the EU's perspective on that is very clear on the parameters within which reassurance and clarification can be provided.<\/p>  <p>  I also thank the Ceann Comhairle and his team.

This issue will be resolved by professional negotiating teams finding a sensible way forward that both sides can live with, that does not undermine the deal that is already on the table but which at the same time provides reassurance and clarification for which many in Westminster are looking.  I hope that can be done but it is too early to be optimistic.  The message I would give to those outside of this House is that the Government is preparing, and is in fact accelerating, its preparations for a no-deal, just in case.  Everybody else should be doing the same.  <\/p> <p> The assumption that all will be okay next week is not an assumption that I believe should be a basis for moving away from trying to be as prepared as we can be over the next 23 days, should the unthinkable happen and Britain crash out without a deal.  I think it is unlikely that this will happen but it is possible.  While it is possible, we need to be alert to the preparations that are needed to protect Irish people and Irish businesses in that context.  I thank everybody and I look forward to being in the Seanad next week to finish the job of finalising the passage of this legislation through the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600040#NN00600","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551887100,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1551887100,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 3.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 March 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
