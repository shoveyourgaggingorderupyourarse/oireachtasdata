I welcome all of our witnesses to the meeting.  Due to the current situation in respect of Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are complying with that constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Today we examine the 2019 financial statements of the University of Limerick.  Areas of interest to members, of which the university's representatives have been made aware, include protected disclosures, the contracting of retired staff, the remuneration and paid notice period of the president, the new student centre and the university's Limerick city campus.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the University of Limerick, UL: Professor Kerstin Mey, interim president; Mr. Andrew Flaherty, director of the human resources division; and Ms Rosemary Fogarty, financial controller in the area of operations.  The witnesses are all very welcome and I thank them for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.  When we begin to engage, I will ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so that any background noise will not be picked up.  As usual, I remind all of those in attendance to have their mobile phones turned off or on silent mode.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations regarding parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are, within the precincts of Leinster House they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation actions in respect of anything they say at the meeting.  They are, however, expected not to abuse this privilege.  As Chair, it is my duty to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to identify himself or herself when first contributing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021061700002#A00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1623918600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The University of Limerick&rsquo;s group financial statements for 2018-2019 show income totalling &euro;279 million.  Of this, income in respect of recurrent State grant and pension funding totalled &euro;82 million.  Academic fees accounted for &euro;103 million, almost a third of which was received directly from the Higher Education Authority.  Research income recognised in the year totalled &euro;34 million, with almost &euro;26 million of this coming from State sources.  Other operating income of &euro;43 million was derived from a range of sources, with 40% coming from rental of student accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The university group&rsquo;s expenditure in the year totalled &euro;281 million.  Pay and pension costs accounted for two thirds of the expenditure total.  Other operating costs were &euro;75 million, while depreciation accounted for just under &euro;20 million.  Overall, the group incurred a deficit of &euro;2.1 million in the year.  However, this must be considered against the group&rsquo;s accumulated revenue reserves of almost &euro;252 million at the end of September 2019.<\/p> <p>  My audit opinion on the financial statements was unqualified.  However, I draw attention to the recognition in the financial statements of a deferred pension funding asset.  In effect, the university is assuming that State funding will be available in the future to meet the pension entitlements already accrued by current and former staff.  This is a standard practice for Irish universities in compiling their financial statements.  My audit report also draws attention to the university&rsquo;s disclosure in section 9 of its governance statement of instances where the procurement of goods and services was not in compliance with the relevant procurement procedures.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements of the University of Limerick Foundation are not consolidated in the group financial statements, on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the University of Limerick.  However, the audited financial statements of the foundation for 2018-19 are appended to the group financial statements for information purposes.  These indicate that the principal activity of the foundation is the furtherance of education and research, and in particular the furtherance of education and research carried out by the University of Limerick and other educational, research and development bodies associated with the University of Limerick.  The foundation&rsquo;s balance sheet indicates that, at the end of August 2019, the foundation had cash of around &euro;20 million.<\/p> <p>  Note 26 of the group financial statements discloses the transactions between the university group and the foundation in the year.  This indicates that the university received income of &euro;2.6 million from the foundation for specific purposes.  The university contributed &euro;350,000 towards the running costs of the foundation.<\/p> <p>  Like a number of the other universities, the University of Limerick appoints commercial auditors to carry out audits of the group companies and of the consolidated financial statements.  In the interests of avoiding duplication of effort, I seek to rely on the work of the commercial auditors to the extent that is appropriate and, by agreement, staff of my office review their working papers as evidence for the purposes of my audit.  While this makes the audit process somewhat more complex and prolonged than normal, it is effective.  Nevertheless, there may be circumstances where my office seeks additional assurance and evidence and I form my own opinion independent of that of the commercial auditors.<\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that my audit of the group&rsquo;s financial statements for 2019-20 is not yet completed.  We received a full set of draft financial statements, including a draft statement of governance and a draft statement on internal control, in mid-March 2021.  Our audit fieldwork, including review of the commercial auditors&rsquo; working papers, has now been completed and the audit file has recently been submitted to me for review.  There are a number of matters where my office has sought additional information and back-up documentation from the university.  When these have been received and reviewed, I will be in a position to clear the account for certification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021061700002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1623918600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I will now call on Professor Mey.

I am accompanied by Mr. Andrew Flaherty, chief corporate officer, and Ms Rosemary Fogarty, financial controller.<\/p> <p>  I became interim president of the University in September of last year.  It was my honour to be the first female appointed to the role of a university president in over four centuries of higher education in Ireland.  Prior to joining UL in 2018, I held senior roles as pro-vice chancellor and dean of the Westminster School of Media, Arts and Design, University of Westminster, and, before then, director of research and enterprise for the University for the Creative Arts in England.<\/p> <p>  Members will appreciate that my accent is not that of a Limerick native.  I was born and raised in Berlin but, like everybody who comes to Limerick, I am immensely proud of the region and of the university and I am very conscious of my responsibility as chief officer to help strengthen this wonderful institution so that it can continue to play a transformative role not just in the mid west but in Ireland and further afield in the decades ahead.<\/p> <p>  The Covid pandemic has meant that the past 15 months have been a very challenging time for the university sector, as it has been for society at large.  While dealing with the practical challenges posed by Covid-19 has dominated our activities during this period, we have also been very conscious of the need to make progress on other issues.  In this context, together with the chancellor and the governing authority, I am very aware that the reputation of the university in recent years has been buffeted too often by controversy and disharmony.<\/p> <p>  I am also conscious that our relationship with this committee has not been as constructive or harmonious as it should have been, and I want to assure members that I will do all I can to make our relationship with the committee a positive one of trust going forward.  The root cause of many of these issues lies in the areas of culture and governance which have been a major focus since I became interim president.<\/p> <p>  On culture, my goal is to reset the organisational culture and to build a new spirit of openness and trust within the university community so that every member of that community feels valued, supported and empowered by a shared purpose.  To strive and thrive we require the talents of all and an inclusive and supportive climate where anyone can come forward with new ideas for improvement and can raise awareness of errors, weaknesses and wrongdoing without any fear of retribution.  In an inclusive, supportive and proactively learning organisation, whistleblowing and protected disclosure &ndash; while always available - will no longer be needed.<\/p><p>To this extent, I have endeavoured to stimulate two-way communication processes between the campus community and senior management, to make improvements to financial reporting and data provision for evidence-based decision-making, and to introduce an inclusive consultation process on our strategic plan, UL@50.  I am pleased to report that the participation in this process has been very encouraging, with 130 individual submissions and 57 group consultations in the first phase and evidence of a strong desire to participate in the second phase, which will inform the recalibration of our strategic plan.<\/p><p> In terms of governance, I can confirm that the recommendations from both the Mazars and Thorn reports have been implemented in full and we are now completing the implementation of the Code of Governance of Irish Universities 2019 and taking into account the recommendations made by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, in CINNTE Institutional Review 2020.  We have also completed an overhaul of UL's policy management framework, ensuring consistent policy development, approval and review processes in line with best practice.  We completed an external evaluation of the governing authority in 2020 by the Institute of Public Administration, with a draft report issued in early 2021 and the subsequent implementation of recommendations.<\/p><p> We have completed training on an annual governance statement and a statement of internal control for all senior managers by external experts, and introduced a new internal audit structure through the appointment of an in-house internal auditor.  We have also introduced an enhanced risk management structure, namely, the audit and risk committee of the governing authority, which now invites owners of local risk registers as a standing item.  Risk management is also a standing agenda item on the executive committee and governing authority.  Finally, we have addressed the structure and size of the executive committee to strengthen governance and ensure a broader representation of all areas of the university in decision-making and, through a flatter structure, create a more distributed leadership to safeguard delivery on strategic initiatives.  The new structure includes the appointment of a chief financial and performance officer through open competition.<\/p><p> I will address three issues that I know have been and are of concern to this committee.  At our previous meeting in 2019, Deputy MacSharry put it to the then president that he should consider reporting a potential incident of fraud at the university to the Garda.  I can confirm that following that meeting, my predecessor sought legal advice in respect of the relevant issue.  The university briefed the Garda on the matter and we have co-operated fully with it on the issue since.<\/p><p> At that same meeting, there was a lot of discussion about the plight of two members of staff who had identified as whistleblowers.  I can confirm we have reached agreement on one individual and the matter is completely resolved with approval from the Department.  In the second case, the individual agreed to the terms of a full and final settlement but subsequently raised concerns about tax liabilities and has not yet signed the settlement that had been agreed.<\/p><p> Finally, there has been some recent speculation about the purchase of the Dunnes Stores site and building in Limerick city by the university for the development of a city campus and the fact that no formal written valuation report for the site before the acquisition is on file.  The governing authority has asked KPMG to conduct an independent review of the governance around that purchase and we will share the outcomes of that review with the committee when it concludes.<\/p><p> I cannot say we have reached the end of what has been a difficult period for the university, but I can say with confidence we are making real progress.  We understand we have to work hard to earn and maintain the trust of all our stakeholders, including this committee.  We are committed to doing so, as am I.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021061700002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Kerstin Mey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623918600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Mey.

I believe this is another appalling tactic on their part.  The university statement about me in this article is a lie, it is wrong, it is deceptive and misleading.  I believe this was done to try and paint a false and wrong picture of me.

It says that person C never consented to be part of a mediation process and has never been in a mediation process with the university at any time.  Later, it takes particular issue with the interim president and her wording and states that there was a lot of discussion about the plight of two members of staff who had been identified as whistleblowers.  Is the interim president not willing to accept that they are whistleblowers?

The main role of the LDA should be strategic land assembly, as is done very well in other countries, and to ensure there is a sufficient pipeline for housing, including social, affordable and cost-rental housing.  The focus of this Bill and of what the Minister has been saying is on State lands currently in public ownership.  That is a good and worthwhile focus but the LDA should also be trying to build up the pipeline and land bank so there will be a continuous supply of land that can be used for housing in coming years.  We really need to move away from the current circumstances whereby many land banks are controlled by a small number of larger developers, which squeezes out the smaller builders, who have an issue.  If the LDA engaged in strategic land assembly and if it were putting in place infrastructure and amenities at the same time, not only would the cost of housing be reduced for everyone, there would also be better supply and better infrastructure and amenities.  That is why LDA should have CPO powers to acquire land needed for housing, not just the limited powers envisaged in the Bill, which relate only to access and ransom strips.  That is what my amendment seeks to do.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#A01600","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment.  I will explain the logic of my slightly subsidiary amendments.  The section of the legislation in question is one of the weaker ones.  It is not a new one in the sense that while the original general scheme of the LDA Bill brought before us in 2019 by the then Minister, Mr. Eoghan Murphy, did not include this provision, he made it very clear that a limited CPO power would be included in the Bill.  That was subsequently confirmed by Mr. John Coleman from the LDA.  The problem is that this is not what was originally envisaged in the national planning framework, to which the origins of a land management agency can be traced back.  It was always the desire of the senior civil servants who initiated the idea of an active land management agency and those other State actors who have been supporting such an initiative, such as the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, to have a body with very powerful CPO powers.  It would have those powers for two reasons.  The first is so that when negotiating with other public stakeholders, it would have strong powers to ensure they would come to the table and provide land at the appropriate price.  It would also mean the active land management agency would be able to force holders of land, public or private, who are not using it to bring it to the table.  That is a key provision for any strategic land management agency.  In the absence of that, it would only be a matter of small strips of land that would be necessary to purchase compulsorily to gain access to a bigger piece of land the LDA already has - I refer to ransom strips - is really a fundamental weakness and one of the great tragedies of this legislation.  It is an enormous missed opportunity.<\/p> <p>  Part of the reason for what I describe is that if we were to give comprehensive CPO powers to the LDA, as currently constituted, as in a commercial DAC, potentially competing with other DACs, it would run afoul of state aid rules in the EU and there could be legal challenges in the European courts, as happened with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  Therefore, it is about protecting the original Fine Gael idea of a land development agency as a commercial residential developer rather than a strategic land assembler.<\/p> <p>  My two amendments are straightforward.  One is to put the focus on land assembly and transfer to those bodies that should be building the homes we want, namely local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.  The second amendment, drafted by the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, is to ensure local authorities are not subject to any CPO powers because that undermines the right of elected members to approve or object to the disposal of land under section 183 of the local government legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#A01700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Boyd Barrett wish to speak on amendment No. 195?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#A01800","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I missed Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's contribution but I suspect our amendment, No. 195, is in a similar vein in that we believe the LDA, rather than being a mechanism to open up the public land bank to private interests, should be moving in the exact opposite direction.<\/p><p>It should aggressively seek to bring privately-owned land suitable for housing that is not being used, but is being hoarded and speculated on, into use.  It should use aggressive compulsory purchase powers to take that land into use, force existing private owners to bring it into use or simply take it from them.  Quite frankly, we need a body that is monitoring, like a hawk, the available zoned building land or, indeed, land that is not zoned but would be suitable for delivering public and affordable housing, and is pouncing on that land to ensure monopolistic control of the building land bank is not in the hands of a relatively small number of private owners, which is currently the situation.<\/p><p> The logic behind amendment No. 195 is to insert the use of compulsory powers into the Bill as a key part of what the LDA should be doing.  The amendment should probably include buildings as well as land.  I might reconsider that for our amendment on Report Stage because I presume the Government will not agree with it.  The way in which empty property in the hands of private owners is just sat on for years and years on end is, frankly, obscene.  It is staring communities throughout the country in the face that existing property is being sat on, is empty and is derelict or whatever, just to wait to see the value of it appreciate and decide strategically when or if it will be developed.  That just should not be allowed.  We should have an agency that goes after that property and land aggressively, to bring it into use for public and affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#A01900","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their amendments and contributions.  I will make a couple of general points.  I would not underestimate the positive effect of the activation of public and State-owned land into the housing market and the effect it will have in driving further private land activation.  We have seen examples of that through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  Land hoarding is not something anyone should support nor should the State, which is the biggest land hoarder in the country.  It is estimated we have enough zoned and serviced land to provide approximately 114,000 homes.  It is very significant to be able to pass this legislation so we can actually get on with developing homes on State-owned land.  I do not want to go over old ground, but I repeat this Bill is to supplement enhanced delivery by local authorities of both social and affordable, not to replace it.  It is an addition to that delivery.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 192 moved by Deputy O'Callaghan, amendments Nos. 193 and 196 moved by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould and No. 195 moved by Deputies Boyd Barrett, Kenny, Murphy, Smith and Barry, I will not accept these amendments because it is not possible to do so.  Section 59 sets out the agency's powers to acquire land compulsorily.  It provides that the agency may acquire land where the land is required to provide access to relevant public land and land owned by the agency or to facilitate the provision of infrastructure required by housing on relevant land or land owned by the agency.  It may only acquire such land if it has first made a reasonable attempt to acquire the land by agreement.<\/p><p>That is effectively giving the appropriate compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers to the Land Development Agency to acquire ransom strips in particular.  There were no CPO powers at all in the original draft general scheme in the last Oireachtas.  This is completely different legislation.  The agency will have proportionate CPO powers.  I am not saying they will not grow in future but we must have regard for state aid rules.  That is, frankly, a consideration as well. <\/p><p>The LDA will, and should, be primarily focused initially on developing public lands and where it seeks to acquire private lands it is intended that it will primarily purchase these through agreement.  Most of us would want agreement in those instances, but we really want to get on with the particular nine sites the LDA has at the moment and to expand that further.  The intention of the Bill is to provide the LDA with appropriate CPO powers to enable it to purchase, as I said earlier, ransom strips.<\/p><p><b><\/b>It is not appropriate that this section be amended to widen the scope of the LDA&rsquo;s CPO powers.  On the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin about other public stakeholders, the LDA will not require CPO powers to deal with other publicly-owned stakeholders because the Government will direct them to do so and to transfer land where required.  More broadly, the Law Reform Commission, as members will know, is examining CPO law.  I expect those recommendations by the end of this year.  It has been ongoing for five years.  I am sure Deputies are aware of the existing complexities of our CPO system.  Reform is needed in that space so we look forward to the Law Reform Commission report. <\/p><p><b><\/b>I also want to reiterate the LDA will not in any way affect the primary role of local authorities as housing authorities.  I have said this on a number of occasions.  It just simply will not.  It does not matter how many times members say it will; it will not.  The LDA will not purchase local authority lands.  If they are offered for sale by local authorities, of course, it will.  However, the LDA will not be CPO-ing any local authority land.  Local authorities will be the main drivers of housing delivery.  That is why, just last week, I gave an instruction to local authorities to buy more land to enhance and increase their land banks, some of which will effectively be used up over the next three or four years.  The Department and I have changed the way we will reimburse local authorities so they will be reimbursed earlier.  I want to build up the public land bank our local authorities have for the delivery of social, affordable and cost rental.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendments as tabled by Deputies and have given my reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#B00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I reiterate that the role of State lands is critical.  It is critical we get affordable, cost-rental and social homes on to State lands.  There is no question about that.  When any of us talk about housing supply to the people involved, be it small builders, the not-for-profit sector and, indeed, local authorities, all of them say one of their big constraints is around getting access to land.  Much development land is controlled by a small number of people who sit on it and release it on a slow basis over time, so they can attain the sorts of prices they want.  That is a key issue.  The Land Development Agency, if it was wide enough in its ambition and it took on the role originally envisaged for it, could play a key role in strategic land assembly.<\/p> <p>  I am not clear on the Minister's response.  He stated compulsory purchase was not possible and cited  state aid rules, but he also said CPO powers may well grow in future.  How is it possible they may well grow in future but it is not possible at all to give those powers now?  In terms of CPO powers and what we are talking about, the idea originates from the 1973 Kenny report.  It is not new.  That report has been through an all-party Oireachtas committee, which looked at it years ago, and many people have looked at it since.  The majority opinion has been that it can certainly be implemented.  To say that we must wait for the Law Reform Commission report, 48 years on from the Kenny report, does not hold water.  <\/p> <p>  This issue is incredibly important in terms of what the Land Development Agency should be doing.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right.  CPO powers do not always have to be used but they give a land development agency, or a strategic land assembly agency, power and clout to be able to negotiate.  This was done very well in some other countries, where municipalities, a land agency or the state were given strong CPO powers.  They did not always use those powers but it allowed them to negotiate, assemble sites and put in the infrastructure to ensure a good, continuous delivery of housing at affordable rates as it was needed, whether cost-rental or social.  This would allow us to get out of these supply logjams.  A key part of the supply logjam is, as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated in its recent report, that the private sector simply cannot deliver on the demand.  It is incapable of doing so even though Ireland has some of the highest house prices in western Europe.<\/p><p>To continue to rely on a small number of developers who hold most of the development land and landbanks and keep that role and power in their hands is a massive mistake in terms of solving the housing crisis, which is what we all want to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#B00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>The real value of having CPO powers is the threat of using them rather than actually using them.  They strengthen the negotiating hand of anybody in discussions.  As the Minister well knows, unfortunately, a large number of the commercial semi-States which have some of these landbanks that are not being used cannot be directed by the Government to transfer land.  For example, the bus garages in Dublin city, whether it is Donnybrook or Pearse Street, are sites of enormous strategic importance particularly in terms of residential and mixed-use developments.  Without a CPO power, if the owners of those lands do not want to engage with the LDA or engage with it in on favourable terms, the agency's hand is greatly weakened.<\/p> <p>  If the Minister is committing not to allow local authority land to come under CPO, I cannot understand why he would not support the Association of Irish Local Government's amendment No. 196 because it simply seeks to put that in the legislation.  I will not labour the point, however.<\/p> <p>  On the one hand, the Government approved the removal of section 183 land disposal powers from local authorities and elected members.  That means basically significant tracts of local authority land could be transferred to the LDA without the approval of elected members or indeed the transparency of the section 183 process.  At the same time, the Minister says he want the local authorities to buy more land.  Why not just let them deliver the housing on the land they own?  That is why it is going to undermine the role of local authorities.<\/p> <p>  As we have already seen with St. Teresa's Gardens, the big projects will be transferred to the LDA while local authorities will be left, in the main, doing smaller infill schemes because the Government will not give them the money or improve the approval and procurement process to get on with it.  The big delay in large local authority schemes is the lack of investment by the Government and the bureaucratic four-stage process.  I will not labour these points, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#C00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>On the last point about the role of the local authorities and the disposal of land, to be honest, the Minister is being somewhat disingenuous.  If one takes Shanganagh, it was the non-elected executive that proposed the transfer of that site to the LDA.  It was Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the usual suspects, which supported it.  We opposed that transfer because we had been campaigning for years for the council to build public and affordable housing on that site.<\/p> <p>  I am not quite sure how the relationship between the Department and county managers and so on works.  They are certainly not told what to do by the directly elected representatives.  It was the non-elected executive's proposal to transfer the land to the LDA.  That was because the policy of this Government and its predecessor wanted private finance and private investment involved in the development of public lands.<\/p> <p>  I will not labour the point but it slowed the process.  I remember Brendan Kenny explaining to the housing committee in the previous D&aacute;il how, if the local authority built on its own land, there was one process for finance, planning and so on.  With the Minister's proposal, there will be three processes.  The evidence speaks for itself in my opinion.<\/p> <p>  On the substantial issue of the amendment itself, does the Minister recognise that the problem of private owners hoarding land suitable for housing is a problem?  Everybody else does.  If the LDA is not going to be the agency to deal with that problem, who will deal with it?  To me, that would have been one of the central purposes of setting up such an agency, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, going right back to the sort of thinking behind the Kenny report.  Does the Minister recognise it as a problem?  If he does, why on earth would he delay this when we are setting up an agency that could have the power to actually do something to deal with the significant problem of land hoarding and activating privately owned land that could be used for housing to help us to address the housing crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#C00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>The housing crisis is getting worse every week.

Land hoarding by anyone is wrong.  These are the matters that have to be addressed.  All public representatives have a responsibility to ensure that housing is delivered in those areas they represent and do not continue to find reasons to oppose housing developments for working people.  That is where this legislation is significant.  Along with the Affordable Housing Bill, this will be the most significant housing legislation passed by this Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The CPO powers are proportionate.  Of course, measures can evolve into the future as with any State agency.  I see that happening.  However, what we need to do right now is to focus on developing the land we have.

Genuine concern has been expressed by organisations such as the Irish Council for Social Housing and various homelessness organisations that, other than on local authority sites where there is a pre-existing agreement to have that higher percentage of social housing, such as at Shanganagh, where the 30% is obviously welcome, there seems to be a working assumption on the part of the LDA that, in the main, there will be 10% social housing.  Even where increased funding may be made available or increased affordable housing will be provided for on sites, the social housing output will be limited, and that is very retrograde.<\/p><p>My view at all times is that the tenure mix should be determined by local need based on the housing needs demand assessment of the local authority and the views of the local elected members because they are best placed.  I do not understand why we often hear references, both in the presentations of the LDA and in the section before us, to Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  That Part applies to private housing developments, which are currently set at 10%, although I warmly welcome the Minister's commitment to increasing that to 20%.  Nevertheless, LDA land should not be constrained by Part V of the Act but rather it should use its land on the basis of identified housing need.  Therefore, unless the Minister can give me a coherent reason Part V should even be referenced in the Bill, I see no reason it should be there.<\/p><p>In general, any of the major sites we have examined, whether they are being transferred to the LDA, being developed by the local authorities or being pushed into questionable joint ventures, have had about 30% social housing, and in fact some are 40%, such as in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Part V, therefore, and the 10% social housing requirement it implies is a real problem if we are to tackle both the social housing and the homelessness crises.  Accordingly, I would be interested to hear the Minister's rationale for including lines 19 and 20 of the section.<\/p><p>I might deal with my amendments in this grouping in three parts because they involve three distinct sets of arguments, but I will be brief when I come back in on the other amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#E01400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":561,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to amendments Nos. 203, 206 and 211.

I will not be accepting any of the amendments Deputies have tabled to Part 9 of the Bill, as I intend to introduce substantial amendments to this Part on Report Stage, in particular on sections 73, 75 and 76.  I mentioned that my intention is to align the provisions of Part 9 with the provisions in the Affordable Housing Bill, which will conclude in the Seanad tomorrow and come into the D&aacute;il next week.  The LDA Bill was published in advance of the Affordable Housing Bill.  They are two very significant pieces of legislation.  I thank Members for their co-operation with them because they are both important.  While Members may not agree with every aspect of the Bills, they will agree that the delivery of affordable homes for working people to buy and to rent is important.  It is an absolute priority for me, for the Government, and I suggest for the Members opposite.  I am going to align the provisions of the Affordable Housing Bill and Part V of the Planning and Development Act on cost rental and affordable purchase with the LDA Bill.<\/p><p> Affordable housing is a priority for all of us.  I understand Members have their own views on how Part 9 could be further refined, but I ask them to withdraw the amendments so that we can consider them on Report Stage when I will be in a position to bring Government amendments on this particular Part.  The purpose of that is to make sure there is an alignment between the definitions on affordability and eligibility with the LDA Bill.  I know Members and their teams have put some effort into tabling amendments on Part 9, but I cannot accept them because we are going to return to them on Report Stage, as I have outlined.  I ask Members opposite to consider withdrawing the amendments at this Stage and reserving the right to reintroduce them on Report Stage when they see the Government amendments.  We can address them in the round on that Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#E01600","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1623884400,"counter":564,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 198 to 218, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#F00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 198:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 45, to delete lines 21 to 32. <\/blockquote> <p>The Minister has requested that amendments are withdrawn based on what he is going to introduce on Report Stage and that we would reserve the right to reintroduce them.  Will the Minister commit that the Report Stage debate will not be guillotined by the Government?  That is very important.  If the Government seeks to introduce a guillotine at the Business Committee, given its D&aacute;il majority, we will not have time to discuss and vote on amendments on Report Stage.  It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that.  It would also be helpful if he could give us a commitment that the Government will not guillotine the Report Stage debate.<\/p><p>The Minister spoke about the importance of the need to maximise the use of State lands for housing, with which I agree.  The amendment seeks to remove the substantial exemptions for commercial and other reasons.  If we are to maximise the potential of appropriate State lands for housing, it is very important the exemptions in the Bill are removed in order that we maximise what we can do in terms of affordable housing, cost rental housing and social housing.<\/p><p>The other amendments in the group that are in my name are amendments Nos. 201, 202, 207 and 212.  They relate to social housing.  I am very concerned about this section.  I note the Minister's commitment here and in the media that he is going to address the issue on Report Stage.  I am very concerned about these sections do not mention social housing.  They refer correctly to cost rental and affordable purchase but social housing is not mentioned at all.  The effect of that would be to limit social housing to just 10% on LDA land and public land, as specified under Part V.  That is a very concerning part of the Bill.  It is welcome that the Minister has committed to addressing it, but we are not sure how it will play out.  To be frank, 20% is not enough.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that this must be done on the basis of housing needs assessment.  That is the logical way of assessing the needs in an area.  Currently, we have more than 8,000 people living in emergency accommodation and 120,000 households on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies.  The idea that social housing on these State lands would be limited to 10% or even 20% of the mix is unacceptable.  Until recently, 100% of public land was used for social housing.  I agree there needs to be cost rental and affordable purchase as well.  I have no issue with that, but these sections do not even mention social housing, and would have the effect of social housing only being delivered at 10%.  That is serious.  It is positive that the Minister is going to address this, but the indication that it is only going to be up to 20% in certain areas is deeply insufficient.<\/p><p>The effect of amendments Nos. 202 and 207 would be to change the 50% baseline of the mix of affordable and social housing and cost rental in the Act to 100%, but if my amendments are accepted it still allows for some degree of flexibility.  I want to hear what the Minister says about Report Stage and if he will commit to the Bill not being guillotined so that we will have time to reintroduce the amendments if we are not happy with the way he has dealt with them.  We must have time on Report Stage to move, discuss and vote on these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#F00400","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":567,"content":"<p>To expedite matters, I will go through all of my amendments in this group.  They are three different types of amendment.  My argument on amendment No. 198 is exactly the same as Deputy O'Callaghan's.  There should not be an exemption from any provisions that seek to maximise the delivery of social and affordable housing on public land.  Therefore, I endorse his argument.  That is the reason we tabled the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 203, 208 and others seek to ensure 100% of the homes on public land are public homes.  It is one of the core differences between most of the Opposition and the Government parties.  I do not see any set of circumstances where unaffordable, open market-priced homes at &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 should be built and sold on public land.  We need social and affordable homes for purchase and to rent.  Therefore, that is the purpose of those amendments.<\/p> <p>  I have four amendments, Nos. 206, 211, 214 and 215, the latter two which were again submitted by the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, representing the local government sector.  All of those amendments seek to do the same thing, which is to ensure it should not be the Minister who decides the tenure mix on any site.<\/p><p>That is not the function of the Minister or his Department.  In fact, they do not have the data to make those decisions.  They are giving a methodology to local authorities, the housing needs demand assessment, HNDA, and any decision on tenure should be made at a local authority level based on the HNDA.  That is the whole function of that exercise.  This arbitrary setting of tenure percentages, often determined by the commercial interests of the developer rather than local housing need, is a really bad way to make housing policy.  Therefore, each of these amendments provides for the role of the local authority and elected members in determining tenure mix.  The implication is that all that would be done in the future on the basis of the housing needs demand assessment and the future city and county development plans, which is the correct evidence-based way, not for a Minister to arbitrarily pick figures out of a hat, or, indeed, the LDA or the LDA in a subsidiary with a DAC and a joint venture with a private sector interest determining those percentages on the basis of investment decisions which, for example, I am concerned may happen in the Dundrum central site.  I will not withdraw any of the amendments, irrespective of what the Minister is promising to come back with on Report Stage because from everything he has said to date, I believe that his amendments will still leave open the possibility of some level of unaffordable open-market price homes of &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000 being delivered on public land and that is not what that land should be used for.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#F00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I would like to hear the Minister's rationale for giving himself the power to exempt LDA developments from Part V.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#G00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":570,"content":"<p>It does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#G00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":571,"content":"<p>That is what it does.

The Minister said we will align the Bill on affordable housing with the LDA Bill and so on, that there will be a series of amendments to that effect.  Will he clarify what \"social housing\" is?  I refer to the eligibility criteria and particularly the income thresholds and what the Minister envisages.  There is a problem in respect of the cohort of people who are eligible for social housing, for Part V and whatever proportion of LDA developments shall be social housing as against, for example, cost rental or affordable purchase.  My fear and suspicion, given that the income thresholds have not risen for a decade, is that there is a concerted policy to make fewer and fewer people eligible for social housing and that consequently, the proportion of LDA developments that will be social housing will become smaller and smaller.  Cost rental, which is essentially a higher rent of social housing will slowly but surely substitute for traditional social housing with a differential rent scheme.  If we are to fully understand the potential implications of the LDA, we need to know who the Government envisages as being eligible for social housing in the future as against, for example, cost rental.  It is a bit difficult for us to understand terms like \"affordable\" if we do not know the income cohort which the Government envisages will be eligible, compared with social housing.  Otherwise we do not know what \"social housing\" means or who it will be for.  I would like that clarified.<\/p> <p>  With amendment No. 200, we are simply trying to prevent any transfer to anyone other than the local authority or approved housing bodies.  We believe, as has been well rehearsed in this debate, that this would ensure the transfer and completion of ownership of the planning authority or to persons nominated by the planning authority and nobody else, that is, no disposal to any other interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#G02400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>If Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is not present, I will move on to Deputy McAuliffe, who has tabled amendments Nos. 204, 209 and 218.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021061700002#G02500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1623884400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister suggesting that he will seek to address it on Report Stage.

We understand that the housing crisis affects everyone, including renters, people looking for social and affordable houses, and those trying to buy private houses.  Public land has to be used to deliver public houses.  That is where we and the Minister fundamentally disagree.  Allowing private developers and speculators onto public land is not something that we can support.<\/p> <p>  On amendments Nos. 214 and 215, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said about the tenure mixture, the local authority must be able to outline the housing need in its locality.

A core policy of the Green Party is 100% public housing on public land, which I continue to call for.  I led the initial programme for Government negotiating team last year, where this would have stood at 60% private housing on public land.  That has dropped from 60% to 30% and, today, to 0% in our major cities where the housing crisis is felt hardest.  This amendment will allow for cost rental, affordable purchase and social housing to be provided for to a maximum in Dublin and Cork.  All of these housing models provide affordable State homes to people who need and deserve them.  I thank the Minister and his team.  M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas.

I thank them and the Chairman for their engagement with regard to Report Stage amendments that I will table to substantially increase the affordable quotient in our major cities, as Deputy Duffy said.  I thank him.  We will have a 100% social and affordable requirement.  For those who say that this Bill is not transformative from the one published in the previous D&aacute;il, these measures are significant.  We will increase the baseline for affordability to a minimum of 50%.  Any decrease would require a positive resolution by the D&aacute;il.  I will table that type of amendment to section 9 on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I will address points made by Deputies Gould, &Oacute; Broin, O'Callaghan and Boyd Barrett.  The LDA will provide housing above and beyond what local authorities will provide on their own lands.  It will be on LDA lands.  The housing needs demand assessment came up at the previous meeting.  It is a new tool for all local authorities.  Local authorities know on the basis of our research how much social, affordable and private housing, if we are allowed to use the word \"private\", is needed in their own areas.  If the LDA is developing a site of State agency land and, in that area, there is a requirement for far more than the minimum 10% social housing, it would be increased up to 50% because we have set a requirement of 50% affordable housing.  Most of us recognise that there is an urgent need to address those working people who have found themselves stuck in a rental and unaffordability trap.<\/p> <p>  We are the first Government to roll out a national cost rental scheme.  We and our colleagues in government, Fine Gael and the Green Party, will have a national cost rental scheme rolled out within a year.  We will have people in cost rental homes this year.  Should the Affordable Housing Bill pass, which I earnestly hope it will, with the support of Opposition Members as well, we will have people in affordable purchase homes this year.  That is what it is about for all of us.  It is about making change in this area to improve the lot for our people, especially those who are so acutely affected.<\/p> <p>  I will address Deputy O'Callaghan's question about Report Stage.  The scheduling and length of time on Report Stage is not up to me.  It is a matter for the Business Committee.  I am guided by it as we all are.  I intend to table specific amendments on Report Stage.  We were not delaying them in any form.  It is simply a phasing of them in conjunction with the Affordable Housing Bill.  That is when we will make sure that the definitions of \"affordability\", \"proportion\" and \"ratios\" will be brought in.  It is up to each Deputy who has tabled an amendment to move or withdraw it at this stage.  For the purposes of doing our work efficiently and appropriately, I have suggested that amendments be withdrawn.  Deputies can reserve the right to reintroduce them.  I will table Government amendments on Report Stage, which I hope will be soon, because I, my Government colleagues and others who have spoken here want to have this legislation passed by the recess because it is urgent.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about social housing.  Social housing is defined and eligibility for it is being reviewed.  I note his comments at the previous committee meeting.  He believes that social housing lists should be open to everyone.  He is entitled to that view.  That would mean that millionaires would be on the social housing list too.  I do not agree with that and think that social housing should be focused on those who need it most.  We will expand the provision of social housing.  To take the Deputy's point in the manner in which it was put, the review of the eligibility criteria and income limits is being done and is expected to be completed in the coming months.  The affordable housing eligibility and criteria fit into that and to what we will do with our social housing.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputies Duffy, Higgins and McAuliffe for withdrawing their amendments while reserving the right to table them again on Report Stage.
