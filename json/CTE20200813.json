We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee this morning.<\/p> <p>  On previous occasions, both through written submissions and oral evidence, ICTU has outlined to members details of our active and significant role in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak in Ireland on behalf of workers.  In June, this committee sought and received our submission relating to the emergence of clusters of Covid-19 in the meat processing sector.  It is, therefore, not my intention to repeat the points raised therein.<\/p><p>Meat processing plants, in our view, are very vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19 and should be regarded as high-risk workplaces in terms of viral spread.  There are specific features which underpin this classification that are recognised globally.  Meat processing is labour intensive, involving very physically demanding work, organised around at-pace production lines where workers work in close proximity to one another, making social distancing difficult to achieve, while language differences can often impede good communications.  Despite the fact that this is a highly profitable, heavily subsidised industry, low pay and deficient terms and conditions, including the absence of sick pay schemes, are common across the sector.  Workers may often live in crowded or congregated accommodation settings while transportation to and from work may not always be conducive to practising the required social distancing measures.<\/p><p> From a very early stage, our affiliate trade union, SIPTU, has continuously highlighted the vulnerability of the meat processing sector to the spread of Covid 19.  I have no doubt its representatives will elaborate on this.  We have also regularly liaised with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, on these matters.<\/p><p> For our part, congress has, through the consultative forum of the national safety protocol, sought to have a number of key principles adopted, which would serve to contain the spread of the virus and address the recent spikes in cases in meat processing plants in the midlands.  A special meeting of the forum was convened last Friday, 7 August 2020, to discuss the crisis in the sector.  It was attended by the acting chief medical officer.  At that meeting, congress called for the introduction of regular testing of all workers in the meat processing sector and the reassessment of the use of PPE in these plants.  It called on the Health and Safety Authority to conduct random and unannounced inspections of all meat processing facilities, with instruction for closure where appropriate, bearing in mind its extensive powers of enforcement.  In addition, where workers have tested positive and are on sick leave, self-isolating or in circumstances of temporary lay-off, congress stated they should be paid.  We note that following this meeting, the Government announced that the pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 covering sick pay, isolation period and lay-off time will be made available to migrant workers and those living in direct provision settings.<\/p><p> Congress has petitioned both the Health and Safety Authority and the Government to classify this disease as an occupational injury which would provide statutory protection to workers in the face of Covid-19, but to no avail.  The effect of its exclusion from the scope of current regulations is that the employer is not obliged to notify the Health and Safety Authority of incidents of employees having contracted the disease in the course of their employment.  Consequently, the HSA cannot undertake an investigation so as to establish how it may have occurred, nor can it advise or give instructions on the prevention of similar occurrences.  This is a major flaw in current regulations that should be rectified swiftly.  Congress is very dissatisfied that the HSA seems not to be supportive of this remedy but rather views Covid-19 as a public health matter and not a safety, health and welfare at work issue.  Congress, through its HSA board representation, has sought to have this very serious matter progressed but all such efforts have been rejected through correspondence from the chairman of the HSA.<\/p><p> In the face of this lethal virus the health and safety of our communities and workforce is paramount.  Therefore, no effort should be spared in ensuring that all the necessary measures are put in place to contain and eliminate this disease.  We hope the committee will recommend favourably on the matters we have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#B01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King very much.

Our 6,000 and more members in the meat processing industry have been extremely concerned about the potential for their exposure and, by extension, their families, to Covid-19, as they rightly believed that the industry was insufficiently prepared to deal with what was and is an unfolding public health and occupational health crisis of unprecedented nature and scale.  The justified concerns of our members were predicated on the experiences being suffered by fellow meat processing and abattoir workers in the United States, Canada and across Europe.  Our national network of shop stewards and health and safety representatives was in constant contact with our officials on the ground about concerns relating to the need for adequate provision of PPE, multilingual health and safety information, etc.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU took on board those legitimate concerns and responded as follows.  On 20 March, we raised concerns with certain employers and public representatives about health and safety within the industry.<\/p><p>On 3 April, we wrote to the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, noting that our members' health and safety was of paramount importance and the need for his Department to support both industries in advance of a Covid-related European Union special agricultural committee meeting taking place on 6 April.  On 10 April and 1 May, we publicly called for mandatory temperature testing to be put in place for workers in meat plants.  On 28 April, we issued a letter of complaint to the Health and Safety Authority requesting inspections at a particular meat plant.<\/p><p> On 15 May, we again wrote to the then Minister, requesting that he bring together all elements of the meat processing industry to establish a \"farm to fork\" task force to deal with this unprecedented crisis.  We still believe that a sector-specific strategy is required and that workers' considerations must be part of any such strategy.  The Minister did not agree to such a farm to fork task force being constituted.<\/p><p> On 18 May, we wrote to Meat Industry Ireland, MII, seeking a meeting to discuss the ongoing and most serious impact that Covid-19 was having on our members.  MII representatives refused to meet us.  On 20 May, we wrote to the HSA advising of our deep concern at its testimony, given on 19 May, which confirmed that meat plant inspections were only commencing.<\/p><p> In June and July, we called for increased testing of workers and compliance with temperature testing and the updated HSE guidelines of 30 June.  On 16 July, we again wrote to MII, following its commitment given at a meeting of this committee to meet SIPTU representatives, and I am glad to report this meeting occurred on Monday this week.  At this meeting, both parties agreed to seek a meeting with the Health Service Executive national standing oversight committee to discuss the need for repeat blanket testing of workers within the industry, with an emphasis on speed of testing and results, and a protocol to deal with potential scenarios arising.  MII also agreed to bring a SIPTU charter on Covid to its members for consideration.  This charter addresses such issues as support for unannounced HSA inspections, compliance with HSE guidelines and temperature testing and the need for engagement on terms and conditions of employment, with particular reference to pay and sick pay provision.  A further meeting is scheduled with MII representatives for 1 September.<\/p><p> It is now beyond doubt that the meat processing industry contains unrivalled vectors for the transmission of Covid-19, which had previously caused 1,115 meat plant workers to be infected in 20 clusters as of early July.  These vectors include close proximity working, bottlenecks in canteens and toilets, noise pollution causing workers to shout to communicate and which creates droplets circulated through the industrial air cooling systems and relatively low wages causing workers to car pool, share accommodation and in many cases share rooms within that accommodation.  It is notable that circa 90% of workers in the industry do not have sick pay, forcing vulnerable workers to go to work, even if they are feeling unwell with possible Covid-19 symptoms.<\/p><p> In mid-June, we predicted that if a second wave of Covid-19 were to arise, it would manifest itself in the meat processing industry.  This article was published on 23 June and this opinion was predicated on the experiences of other countries, such as the United States and Canada, and the example in Germany, wherein two months after the country announced looser Covid-19 controls, an outbreak in a meat processing plant triggered a return to lockdown in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  This meat plant was closed after 1,500 workers tested positive for Covid-19.<\/p><p> In the Republic of Ireland, we now have circa 1,450 meat plant workers with confirmed Covid-19 cases, with clusters of more than 100 cases in five separate meat plants following the recent resurgence in the midlands.  Other European Union countries long ago set up national outbreak control teams with the voice of meat processing workers being represented.  Why has Ireland not done likewise?  Surely it is the workers who would have greater knowledge of the position on the ground and it is the workers and their families who are vulnerable and most at risk.  Why did the HSA not commence inspections at meat plants until late in May and why do we still have very few unannounced inspections?  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, performs an excellent public duty through its unannounced inspections. Do we cherish the quality of our food more than the safety of our people?<\/p><p> Hourly rates of basic pay across the industry generally range from minimum wage to &euro;12.50 per hour, with some skilled workers able to accrue an additional premium payment through piece-rates and bonuses.  Everyone recognises that meat processing is an essential service but this must be recognised with reasonable rates of pay to reflect the labour intensive and physically demanding roles in meat processing.<\/p><p> As I stated, nine of every ten workers do not have access to a sick pay scheme.  This is a significant contributory factor in the spread of Covid-19 within the workplace.  Why have we not ensured that workers suffer no loss of earnings should they have to isolate?  The pandemic unemployment payment is not an appropriate substitute for the necessary legislative imposition of a sick pay scheme but it could be part of it in the short term where employers make up the net pay balance.<\/p><p> In comparison with our EU peer group, SIPTU's economic research, which can be provided, demonstrates that Irish meat plant operatives work an average of 4.7 weeks per year more than their EU counterparts and rank bottom of the list on actual hourly wages received.  A feature of the continental system is the high level of employer social insurance, which ensures that most workers in our EU peer group receive acceptable illness benefit.<\/p><p> In following the recent commentary about Covid-19 outbreaks in the meat industry, there would seem to be a much higher proportion of asymptomatic cases than in other areas.  I do not know how this is possible.  Very recent commentary has emerged of workers being redeployed from one meat plant to another to finish production at weekends, causing so much concern about contagion that regular employees refused to go back to work until their safety concerns were addressed.<\/p><p>I have been reliably advised in recent days that upwards of 40 migrant meat plant workers are sharing rooms and accommodation in a certain town in Offaly.  Should this prove to be the case and if we are truly serious about defeating Covid transmission within the meat industry, this hot bedding of workers has to stop.  Surely this is not an Ireland that anyone would want to be proud of or indeed be associated with.<\/p><p> Where large Covid outbreaks have been established and production lines shut down, we cannot have a situation, as we believe occurred recently, wherein other workers in that same employment were tested and went back to work to deal with perishable product, and four days later they found out that they had tested positive for Covid.  Where such large outbreaks occur, workers should be immediately removed from the workplace without loss of earnings until the workplace is deep cleaned, sanitised and inspected by the HSA, with workers only returning when they have tested negative for the virus.  We can no longer compromise workers' safety through the unbridled drive for profits.  We have already seen the tragic death of one meat plant worker from Covid-19 on the island of Ireland; we do not need to see another.  Meat may be perishable, but workers must not be so.<\/p><p> The reimposed lockdown in counties Laois, Kildare and Offaly to deal with this crisis is now costing the midlands economy more than it would cost to ensure employers and State agencies are equipped to fulfil their obligations for a safe working environment.<\/p><p> We need legislation to ban subcontracting and bogus self-employment within the meat industry, similar to that announced in Germany on 20 May.  So-called sole traders, working in Irish meat plants, paying tax in Poland, with employers avoiding PRSI contributions, workers missing out on leave and welfare benefits and the State being denuded of tax revenue must be stopped.  Licensed direct employment is the way forward in this regard and an end to agency working in this industry is now necessary.<\/p><p> It is never too late to do the right thing and Tuesday's belated announcement by the Government for repeated weekly blanket testing of workers in meat plants, which we have been calling for for some time, within the lockdown areas is welcome, but we need to go further.  We need rapid result turnaround times for this testing within 24 hours, as is the case in the UK.  We also need a clear protocol as to how cases or suspected cases of Covid are isolated within the workplace and how co-workers within that work area or employment are treated.<\/p><p> The emergence of Covid-19 within the Irish meat processing industry has been extremely difficult for our members.  They are all petrified of contracting the disease and they feel they must walk a tightrope every day.  In many cases, they attend work even if they are unwell.<\/p><p> We have had many cheerleaders trumpeting the essential nature of meat processing at both Government and employer level.  It is now time for these entities to put their money where their mouths are and recognise the need for workers within the industry to have decent pay, sick pay and pension provision put on a statutory footing, similar to that of a sectoral employment order.  This will be the litmus test of those who are saying they are doing everything they can to eradicate Covid-19 in the Irish meat industry.<\/p><p> As Covid will prevail for possibly years to come and meat will always remain an essential foodstuff for our population, we have little choice but to shine a light like never before on this industry and address once and for all the socio-economic issues which have given rise to the meat industry being the perfect storm for the transmission and predicted resurgence of Covid-19 in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Ennis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I note Mr. Ennis has called for a 24-hour turnaround period in testing.

On behalf of the Independent Workers Union, I thank the committee for inviting us to present our findings today.<\/p> <p>  The Cork Operative Butchers Society branch of the Independent Workers Union has been supporting workers in meat plants and in the meat industry for a long time and has been in daily contact with workers of different nationalities employed in several meat plants around Munster for the duration of the pandemic thus far.  As the workforce in this industry is largely foreign, with limited English fluency, I emphasise that our union, even though it is small, has had privileged access to these workers&rsquo; experiences, as our team includes Polish and Romanian-speaking organisers, and the union constantly strives to provide translation for any other language which is necessary for organising this diverse workforce.  I personally have been in contact with Romanian workers in several plants each day since the beginning of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly state our union&rsquo;s position on the matter discussed today.<\/p><p>This union believes there is no intrinsic reason why working in a meat plant should be more conducive to contracting Covid-19 than working in any other environment.  We are convinced that the reason Ireland has witnessed so many worrying outbreaks in meat plants in the past months is due to the workers&rsquo; substandard employment and living conditions which are the result of the industry&rsquo;s long-term disregard for the well-being of its staff. These problems are aggravated by the unscrupulous practices of the work placement agencies through which many of the workers in this sector are employed.  Based on our membership a high percentage, perhaps 40% or 50% - we do not know - of these workers are employed through agencies.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly list the main factors which led, in our opinion, to such a dire epidemiological situation in the meat-packing sector in Ireland.  I would like the committee to bear in mind that, in our view, these Covid-19 outbreaks are simply the most visible consequence of chronic issues that should be of great concern in their own right.  First, there is the question of overcrowded accommodation.  Many meat plants are in rural areas where there is a shortage of suitable accommodation to begin with.  As most meat workers are paid the minimum wage, often with no overtime premium, their tight budgets force them into seeking shared accommodation, sometimes even with several families in the same house.  At the same time, being foreign and with a limited command of English is a real disadvantage in independently securing accommodation.  Many workers we know are being housed by their employment agencies which, seeking to maximise profit from the accommodation they provide to their employees, crowd as many people as possible into each house they let.  This reckless behaviour on the agencies&rsquo; part also led to people being moved from one shared house to another during the height of the pandemic in an effort to keep each house full so as not to lose income.  Our union has documented several such cases.  The workers housed by the employment agencies never get a proper contract for their paid accommodation, even after several years of living in the same place, so they can be moved around or evicted without notice, both of which have happened since March to workers we know.  It is obvious that this dismal housing situation favours the spread of Covid-19 among workers and, despite relating to conditions outside of work, is a result of low pay and dependency on the employer for accommodation.<br\/><br\/>Second, most workers need to provide their own transportation to get to work.  As I said earlier, many meat plants are in quite remote areas and the employers make no effort to provide any transport.  There is no public transport available.  On a tight budget, the workers car pool and they fill the cars to capacity.  This has continued throughout the pandemic as most employers make no effort to facilitate the safe and socially distant transport option, either through a company bus or with financial assistance for private transportation, both of which would have been possible, while perfectly aware of how their staff get to work every day.<br\/><br\/>Third, many workers in this sector do not benefit from a sick-pay scheme with their employer and this is especially the case with all the agency workers we know.  This means that these workers, while already on very low pay, know that when they are ill they will not be able to earn any money at all.  Of course, this logically leads to some workers being less cautious than they should ideally be after noticing early symptoms of what might or might not be a worrying condition.  We also know that many workers, after years in Ireland, do not have a GP, which can be seen as an indirect consequence of extremely difficult working conditions.  When working on minimum wage, one has to work excessive hours, often more than 50 hours a week, to get by.  This limits the time available to find a doctor and the time to learn the basics of English to communicate with a medical professional.  One has to pay for the doctor and often also for the translator when visiting the doctor.  A special case of this lack of access to healthcare, but of great importance, is that of a great number of workers, all Romanian, who were for years cheated out of their social security rights in Ireland by the employment agency which was hiring them to work in several meat plants in Munster.  This agency employed all these Romanian nationals as self-employed contractors declared in Poland, so all the workers' contributions were sent to the Polish and not the Irish Revenue.  I emphasise it is our union that has uncovered hundreds of such cases and we have filed hundreds of complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission.  For many years, all of these workers have had no annual leave, no right to illness benefit, no rights to child allowance, had no PPS numbers, and were <i>de facto<\/i>invisible in Ireland.  While some of these workers were self-isolating on suspicion of Covid-19 in March, they had no access to a doctor, no GPs would take them and their agency tried to force them to apply for unemployment benefit instead of the Covid-19 illness benefit, taking advantage of the fact that the workers had no GPs and no English.  Our union is present in several plants where this agency operates in Munster and we have knowledge of other places in Ireland where the same practices are happening and where the same agency supplies workers.  When these workers have no legal existence in Ireland for years they are also not entitled to illness benefit and they are extremely vulnerable.  Based on these observations I will emphasise one last point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Labo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Labo to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#F00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I ask for just five seconds; my colleague spoke more.  These workers are not just vectors for a virus.  They are not just vectors for a disease.  They are people with full lives.  It is important to take into account all aspects of their lives when we think about how to prevent this disease.  For example, if Perspex screens are introduced and we do not take into consideration that the workers then must lift heavy crates above the Perspex screens, then their workload is greatly increased and, while the pace of their work has never slowed during the pandemic, such measures will not work.  The workers' well-being, their workload, their mental health, their income and social and economic conditions have to be taken into account if we want to contain this disease.<\/p><p> As my colleagues said, we recommend unannounced inspections.  However, we also recommend democratically elected workers' health and safety committees in each factory and these should be consulted on any measures.

I will say two things.  When we previously gave evidence before the committee, we spoke mainly about the national Return to Work Safely Protocol and its provisions.  One of the key flaws in its implementation in meat factories relates to worker representation on the ground.  Putting in place worker representation infrastructure is a key part of the protocol to facilitate quality interaction between the management and the workforce in the various work settings.  That has not happened in meat factories.  Worker representation infrastructure is very low-grade, although the employers do not agree with me on that.  I have raised this matter on several occasions at the consultative forum on the implementation of the protocol and I have told the employers that I am very unhappy because the workforce representation has not been effective at all.  There are many reasons for that which we can go into in more detail, and I am sure others will do so.<\/p> <p>  Second, it is untenable that the HSA, which is assigned in law the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of all aspects of the protocol, has the power to inspect workplaces and order closure where appropriate and is there to maintain the health and safety of workers and protect them in the workplace, is not even notified when a worker contracts Covid.  We have to get our heads around that.  I realise the import of what I am saying, but all the indicators are that the HSA does not want to be notified of such cases.  It does not want this task.  From day one, I have had this argument with Government representatives.  I am on record on this matter and am blue in the face writing about it.  Two weeks ago, I met the T&aacute;naiste and for the first time he said he would consider the points we were making about this issue.<\/p><p>If we have a Health and Safety Authority, HSA, charged with the protection and the prevention of injury and so on to workers in workplaces and it is not even notified, does not do the inspections and does not go to the place to find out what happened and give advice on what should happen to prevent it happening again, we will arrive in all sorts of a mess.  It says it is a public health issue, which it is, and as the members know the public health people operate under legislation from 1981.  They go and do what they have to do to protect not just in the workplace but they are also very interested in the spread of this virus in terms of the community.  That is their job but there is no emphasis satisfactorily in that regard.  That has to be put right and we believe there is a swift way of doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Durkan, in short, \"No\".  I am far from happy and I will give him the reasons with regard to Kildare that he mentioned.  We have a situation in meat plants in Kildare where lines are shut down, for example, and 50% of the workers have tested positive and are taken out of the workplace.  That is fine, but we have other workers in that meat plant dealing with a different product who are tested and then sent back in to deal with perishable product - product of value.  They then get the results four days later and they are told that they have Covid-19.  That is unforgivable.  That is a real issue that should never be repeated.<\/p> <p>  The second point I would make is that we are too slow to get test results, and I believe that is still the case this week in Kildare.  The issue of the HSA inspections needs to be drilled in once and for all because we are not happy with the number of unannounced visits.  I believe there are very few, if any, and the HSA needs to be pressed on that.  Looking forward, however, in terms of trying to fix this, because we have to fix it, I suggest we need to bring in what I have termed Covid compliance officers with the sole responsibility for policing Covid-19 within the meat industry.  Those designated officers possibly should come from the HSA inspectorate and if it needs to be beefed up, we must beef it up - no pun intended.  We have to ensure we deal with this issue because what has happened in Kildare, and in other counties, for the past number of months is not acceptable.  We are too slow to get test results.  We need the HSA to be doing what it is paid to do.  We need Covid compliance officers.  At the end of the day, I am not at all satisfied with what has happened.  We cannot prioritise profits over the health and safety of our workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Ennis"},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ennis.

There is no doubt that many of the terms and conditions of employment in the meat industry must be addressed, particularly the issue of bogus self-employment.  They are matters I have no doubt the trade union movement has been working on long before this issue arose and will continue to do so.  For the remit of this committee, the impact of the virus is our focus.  The learning point seems to be that where there is co-living and close working, with very few public transport options, there is an inevitability that that will lead to a cluster of Covid-19.  My question is for all the witnesses.  It appeared for a long time that meat industry plants would not be impacted in the same way they were elsewhere in Europe, particularly in June and July.  Have the representatives been given any information as to the reason this has happened now?

I commend the trade union representatives appearing before the committee on their efforts, not just in respect of this issue but on many others down the years.  Some may be aware that I used to be a branch secretary for a number of years in a workplace in the Unite trade union, so I support and have sympathy for and an awareness of the work the representatives do.<\/p> <p>  I wish to put my questions in context.  Since I am a representative from the lockdown counties as they are now known, I will briefly recap what has happened in the past week in Kildare, Laois and Offaly and the impact it has had upon businesses.  Small businesses, which are employers in their own right, had just picked up the pieces and were beginning to get off the ground again in terms of trading, restoring consumer confidence as well as their own in their operations, bringing workers back into their workplaces and investing in PPE, screens and so on.<\/p><p>Perishable stocks, which were bought in for what they hoped was the remaining part of the tourism season, are now written off and wiped out.  I refer to not only those businesses which have been forced to close but the businesses around them, such as fashion boutiques and retailers, which are seeing such a plummet in footfall.  That is the impact it has had on the business community.  In terms of destination shopping venues, such as Naas and Kildare Village, nobody is coming in from outside because they are not allowed to do so and there has been a huge knock-on effect on local businesses and the local economy.<br\/><br\/>In terms of people who feel they have done everything right - they have worn their masks, they have minded themselves, they have stayed indoors, they have social distanced and all the rest of it - any chance of a staycation has gone.  Any chance of family breaks are gone.  By and large, people have cancelled <i>en masse<\/i>.  Not only are there all the implications but they themselves cannot even get away.  That is psychologically damaging.  That is a huge blow to the county.  I suppose what really compounds it is the view that outbreaks are concentrated on the meat plants.  There are particular clusters but three counties are paying the price for three or four plants.<br\/><br\/>There is a number of boundary conditions, etc., which I do not have time to go into.  There are certain estates, for instance, Kilmalum in Blessington, where the back of the cul-de-sac is in Kildare and to get out of the estate in the morning, people have got to break the law because of the way the lockdown was done.  In any event, I want to move on to questions to the witnesses.<br\/><br\/>I read all the submissions this morning and thank the witnesses for the presentation today.  The State put in place a number of supports to help workers and help the wider economy and the wider society during the pandemic but it strikes me that these have not been applied, or that we have not been able to apply them, in the sector.  We heard about temporary accommodation and about accommodation issues.  Despite there being an eviction ban in place, we saw that workers were forced to move from one place to another and often cohabit.  We saw workers afraid to take sick leave and afraid to phone in sick despite there being the pandemic payment and temporary wage support schemes.  It strikes me, as a general rule, that many of the State supports were not available, whether through ignorance, lack of awareness or possibly lack of promotion within those workplaces, and all those issues must be examined.<br\/><br\/>I will home in on one issue because Ms Patricia King has mentioned this.  This is the notification of a workplace disease, the definition of personal injury and the idea that if somebody trips on a floorboard or injuries himself or herself on a piece of machinery in a factory, that is notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.  If somebody presents with coronavirus or another infectious disease, that is not.  What we have heard Ms King and others say today and in recent days is that the plethora of sanctions, inspections and powers that would kick in were that in that statutory instrument and were part of the Health and Safety Authority framework would be there and the power of the State could be brought to bear but because this disease is not listed as a notifiable illness, that does not happen.  I studied the regulations again this morning.  When I see the 2016 regulations - we have heard that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment could make a one-line change to those regulations to introduce infectious disease or coronavirus as a notifiable illness - it was there previously in the 2011 and 2007 regulations.  In the 2016 regulations, it was deliberately taken out.  Turning to page 3 of those regulations, I see that &quot;&quot;personal injury&quot; does not include any disease, occupational illness or any impairment of mental condition&quot;.  That is the real scandal here, not that it is not there at present which, of course, it should be, but that it was previously there and was removed.  I would ask for the witnesses' opinion on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#J03200","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses, between them, to speak for no more than a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#K00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy and thank him for the query.  The Deputy is correct.  This regulation 224, put in in 2016, excludes personal injury.  In the Act, accident is defined as personal injury and personal injury does include any infectious disease, but the regulation, in 2016, came along and excluded it.  My judgment is that the employers are hung up about the mental health issue there and they did not want to have this - what they believed to be onerous.  That is my own judgment of what was going on at that particular time.  However, this regulation was signed up to anyway.<\/p> <p>  As to what can happen, section 58 of the Act allows the Minister to lay an amended regulation before the Houses of the Oireachtas, but it becomes valid from the time of its making unless and until it is amended by the Oireachtas.  We could resolve this problem quickly.

If the T&aacute;naiste is minded to make the requisite changes, I have legislation which I published in June which will ensure this is done.  I look forward to support for this from Members right across the House.  There is general agreement that if one contracts Covid in the workplace, it should be treated as a workplace injury.

The HSE would have carried out significant testing in a particular plant.  It would have been aware of a strong presence of Covid.

When one blows a whistle in a plant, there are many carcasses - I am sorry to be so graphic - lying about.  It is valuable product as far as the employers would see it.  Those workers were tested and even though they were in a workplace where there was a significant number of confirmed cases of Covid, they went back in without having first got the results of their tests.

Sometimes workers called me with a photo of the mask and asked me to tell them how to use it, could it be re-used or how long it was good for because no such instructions had been given by the employing agencies.  In terms of translation and everything else it has been dismal.  For some communities that have been in Ireland for longer, like the Polish community, perhaps the factories have some available translation or supervisors who are already from that background and speak the language.

This is a problem.  The Deputy asked how many cases are in the migrant category.  I watched the meeting of this committee that was addressed by Meat Industry Ireland and its representatives may appear again today.  I found it ironic that eastern European workers, although they have free movement across the EU, are not recognised by Meat Industry Ireland as migrant workers.  That is spin.

It is now 70% migrant and 30% indigenous workers.  As such, there will be, <i>pro rata<\/i>, more cases among workers because of vectors such as cramped living conditions and the car-pooling that workers are forced into using.

Our union - often me - has had to help workers by providing them with the relevant forms, filling in these forms for them and so on.

Many people did not have GPs as they did not have a PPS number.  This was because they had been scammed by their employment agency.  These workers were in a very difficult situation and the agencies and the hirers, by which I mean the factory owners, did not help their staff in any way.

We put in preventative and corrective measures within the charter.<\/p> <p>  I believe we absolutely need to look at the meat processing industry from every angle.  As I outlined previously, we need all of the stakeholders to be involved but we definitely need to look at the terms and conditions of workers within that industry.  It is not good enough to cheerlead, call it an essential service and pay people a pittance for very labour-intensive and sometimes very challenging work in meat plants.<\/p> <p>  This has shone a light on the meat industry.  When a crack opens up the light comes in and this has been the crack in the meat industry.  It is about time that this industry was put under the microscope.  There is nothing wrong with an employer making profits once they are generated through workers that are on reasonable terms and conditions.  That is the trade-off and at the moment that is not happening.  I would welcome a task force and I would love if this committee recommended it.

In some cases there is a collective agreement on terms and conditions but that is not the norm and it is not by any means in the majority of cases.<\/p><p> I sit on the Low Pay Commission and I have taken part in public consultations where we have had exposure to workers coming in from the street to offer their view on what happens in their environment in meat factories as well.  We are well aware of the issues.  There is a very large body of opposition to workers having any voice in the industry and there is a reason for that.  With a production pace at this level, it is the focus of the employers.  We can look at the top ten companies operating in the sector.  The top company had a turnover of &euro;2.3 billion in 2019 and the second company had a turnover of &euro;2.2 billion.  There is big money to be made and their focus is on keeping the production lines as fast and as lean as possible.  The model is to work people as hard as they can for as little as they can for as long as they can.  It is the model and the companies will resist any infiltration by us in trying to have discussions.<\/p><p> These companies are helped by a lack of legislation in this country.  This means if those workers want to have their voice heard collectively, there is no law to help them in doing that.  The balance of power is with the employers and it is not a question that we have not said this.  We are blue in the face from saying it.  I have been doing this for a living for three decades and I can tell the committee that although we are blue in the face from making this argument, we still have not succeeded in getting across the value of having a balance in the employer-worker relationship.

It is important to note where are the profits.  There is no doubt there is a small number of players in the market and they are very much in control of that market.<\/p> <p>  I listened to the president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, on television yesterday speaking about the poor price being paid to farmers for their produce, with farmers having to operate below cost.  The business operates a cost model.  Has SIPTU considered going to the Government to speak about the below-cost selling of meat, which is ultimately a big component of this problem?  I worked in the meat industry 30 years ago and at that time we sold meat at a higher price per kilogramme than we are selling it today.  The below-cost selling and loss leading of meat, particularly in the convenience sector, is a large proportion of the Irish price.  The witnesses know 90% of our meat exports are sold to the European market and we are subject to the pricing conventions within that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#S00600","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.

In many cases, and particularly in the white meat industry, these people are getting &euro;10.10 per hour, with no sick pay or pension provision and basic leave entitlement.  It is the same with the red meat and pork segments.  There are different areas with differing pay rates relating to skill sets and so on but in the main we are seeing workers getting &euro;12 or &euro;13 per hour, including the piece rate.<\/p><p>It is immeasurable.  We have had a recent situation with SEOs.  I believe the Government may be appealing that High Court judgment and I wish it well with it.

We have calculated that if every member of staff got a pay increase of &euro;1 an hour, it would only affect the price per chicken by 8 cent.

The meat factories themselves are not in a position to recruit on that basis which is why they look to agencies.  Ms Labo has highlighted that agencies are not passing on the overtime.

Legislation arising from a European directive in 2012 was introduced to deal with temporary agency workers.  It provides that agency workers should not be treated any less favourably than their counterparts who are directly employed.  However, this is being bypassed by some employers by constructing this self-employed company they are putting in place.  They are constructing a way around this.  In aviation it is done in a very sophisticated way.  In this case I gather it is not that sophisticated.  The home employer is in Poland and not in Ireland at all.  When those workers are fictitiously or bogusly self-employed, they end up with no entitlements to anything and those workers lose out.<\/p> <p>  What have we done about it?

Unless we get to a place where workers are not regarded as self-employed until they put forward the evidence as being non-bogusly self-employed, we will not deal with this.  We have hawked ourselves around the place to anybody who would listen to this to take on this argument.  I had a conversation with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.

The meat price is still not what it should be.  It should be at least &euro;4.20 per kilogram but farmers are not getting the colour of that, although there has been a slight improvement when compared with last year.  This time last year, we had chaos with suckler and beef farmers on their knees outside factory gates pleading with factories to give them a fair price for their produce.  Now we see the problem of meat factory workers coming to light.  While this problem has been around for decades, it is only being exposed now.<\/p><p>  I have argued strongly that we need to see the meat factories reined in.  For some reason, a blind eye has been turned for too long with regard to meat producers and the workers in meat plants.  We need an overhaul and we need it fast.  As a Member of the Rural Independent Group, I call on the Government to take action once and for all because this cannot continue.  It is ruining livelihoods, communities and regions.  I come from the Laois-Offaly constituency.  We have been unfairly punished because of meat factories.  Some businesses are closing as they cannot continue any longer because of the actions of the meat factories.  This has to stop.  The midlands region is already on its knees, with Bord na M&oacute;na workers losing their jobs and more of them set to lose their jobs before Christmas.

The committee was told previously about a national outbreak control team which would deal with the problem in the meat factories.  I think I know the answer to my next question, which is rhetorical in a sense.  What evidence is there of any work being carried out by this national outbreak control team?  It sounds great but has it done anything?<\/p><p> Mr. Ennis outlined that testing turnaround times are a serious issue and I agree with him.

Does SIPTU know how many complaints it has received from workers about conditions in the meat factories?  Has it received more complaints since 20 May when we had 828 cases?

Deputy Nolan asked for how long testing should continue.  It will have to continue for as long as it is needed.  We could, rightly, blanket test workers in the HSE, nursing homes and residential care.  For five months, we have been raising the fact that there are perfect vectors in meat plants for the transmission of Covid-19.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, we need testing every week on a repeated basis until we get on top of this virus.  This is what we need.  More important, we need the results the following day as happens in the UK currently.  One could test 600 or 700 meat plant workers in one evening in the UK and get the result the following day.  This is what we need.  It is the only chance we have of keeping our workers safe, keeping the communities in Deputy Nolan's constituency safe, which is very important, and maintaining the continuity of meat production.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Nolan also asked about complaints.  As a union official, I have dealt with many high-level disputes over the past 23 years in different sectors, including transport.  I do not believe I have ever seen the volume of calls or complaints, call them what one will, that our officials on the ground have received from members since late April and early May.  I cannot say they go back to March.<\/p><p>It is about our members and their families.  The Deputy referred to there being over 800 Covid cases in meat factories.  I mentioned the 1,115 cases by early July and now there are 1,450 and that figure is heading north.  When those workers have to isolate with suspected or confirmed Covid, their families also have to isolate due to being in close contact with them.  Two partners in a house could both be out of work and looking to get illness benefit or the pandemic unemployment payment.  This is a catastrophe for the economy in the region from which Deputy Nolan comes.  Those three counties are paying a heavy price for us taking our eye off the ball.  We need inspections and testing.  To answer the Deputy's other question, we have received hundreds of complaints from workers about their concerns.<\/p><p> Finally, I have never seen an industry in my experience across the public and private sector where workers are so reluctant to come out front and talk to the media or union officials about their concerns for fear of retribution.

For instance, all these people who are falsely declared in Poland are completely invisible in Ireland.  They do not appear as being insured and having PPS numbers.  We uncovered hundreds of cases in several plants that are unionised with us but hundreds, even thousands, more such people might still be working in these conditions in other plants.  That can only be found out through inspections by, say, the scope section in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is supposed to assess if people are employees or self-employed, Revenue and so on.  A union can have no numbers beyond what its actual members experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Labo"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>If I may assist the Deputy on that, I believe the number of agencies is somewhere in the region of seven or eight.

I welcome all of them back before the committee.  I had an opportunity to question them in early July when the number of cases was decreasing.  That number decreased significantly afterwards as well..  My first question is on the significantly high number of cases, particularly in meat plants but also in direct provision centres, in what my colleague, Deputy Lawless, referred to as the lockdown counties versus other parts of the country.  I would like to hear from the witnesses as to why they believe there is a disparity between Kildare, Laois and Offaly versus the west of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Also, I asked in June about multilingual signage and training.  Has that improved in light of everything we now know about Covid-19 and the threat it causes to migrant workers, low-paid workers or indeed workers in meat plants?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to unannounced inspections, an issue I also raised previously.  One of the witnesses may have mentioned earlier that there were some unannounced inspections but not many.  Can they provide an indication of how many we are talking about because if they are not taking place that is a huge issue in itself?  Hopefully, that will be addressed shortly.<\/p> <p>  Finally, on foot of the witnesses' opening statements, there was a discussion on hot-bedding, which is shift workers sharing bedding or, indeed, housing.  How prevalent is that practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#W01100","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>If I can deal with the four questions, first - and without putting words in the Deputy's mouth - what is the reason for the numbers in the three lockdown counties and why are they not happening anywhere else?  The numbers are stark.  In total, we are looking at just under 300 cases across four employments in the three counties to which the Deputy refers.  It is not dissimilar to what happened in other plants in other areas that are not locked down where 25% of the workforce had confirmed cases of Covid-19 in some instances.  That happened in Cork, Tipperary and other places so we have had five clusters in meat plants with outbreaks of more than 100 confirmed cases.  I do not know why it is happening there.<\/p><p>The reason for this has as much to do with what is happening outside of the workplace as with what is happening in it.  Some employers have worked well with us.  Unfortunately, many workers share accommodation and rooms, which has to do with the Deputy's question on hot bedding, and are being forced to carpool because they are paid a pittance.<\/p><p> The Deputy's next question was on multilingual signage.  It has improved according to our information, albeit not to the extent where I would be satisfied.  The Deputy might say that I would say that anyway.  To be realistic, though, if there are seven or eight different languages in an employment, it would not cost too much to get signs transposed into those mother tongues.  The situation is not ideal.  It has improved, but not to the extent required.<\/p><p> The unannounced inspections I have heard of in the past six weeks number in the single digits.  There are many more announced inspections.  As far as I am concerned, there should be no further announced inspections.  Everything should be unannounced.<\/p><p> I used the term \"hot bedding\" in my opening remarks.  It is a common practice.  Earlier this year, we saw fruit pickers being flown in from Romania at the height of the pandemic.  Hot bedding is an issue in that sector.  I am not saying that it is rampant in the meat industry, but it definitely happens in a number of large towns, particularly one or two towns in the three lockdown counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#W01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Ennis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ennis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#X00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Carthy, who has eight minutes.

We have seen the devastating impact on employees, businesses, families and communities in the three counties that have now gone back into lockdown.  It is no doubt seriously impacting their mental health as well.  We are potentially going to see rolling lockdowns in different counties or areas if the Covid disease is not kept under control or there are other outbreaks.  What is happening in the three counties should be a concern of everybody across the country.<\/p> <p>  Employers are not under a duty to notify the HSA, Health and Safety Authority, of a disease or infection that has been contracted in a place of employment.  Accordingly, the HSA cannot carry out an investigation, advise or give instruction on prevention.  This was there in the pre-2016 regulations, however.  This is totally unacceptable for workers and communities at any time but especially in the current situation.  It also seems to be a destructive attitude if the employers are seeking to keep this position going.<\/p> <p>  It is a function of the HSA to promote the prevention of personal injury.  As Ms Patricia King quite rightly pointed out, personal injuries under the Health and Safety Act 2005 include disease, any occupational illness or any impairment, physical or mental.  Sometimes employers seem to think these regulations are gospel and they can rely on them.  They are made under the Act, however.  The Act is primary and every employer has a duty of care to his or her employees under common law as well.<\/p> <p>  Employers need to start wising up to that and realising that they have a duty of care to their employees.  They need to ensure their employees are protected.  As English is not the first language of many of these employees and they may not have been brought up with the Irish legal system, they may not be aware that when these regulations are wafted around in front of them that it is not gospel or the be-all and end-all of an employer's duties.<\/p> <p>  From reading the legislation and previous regulations, I can see how this duty could be easily put back with the HSA by bringing in regulations as opposed to the necessity for further legislation.  It certainly needs to be amended to make it a duty for employers to report any disease or infections in a place of work.  Is it the understanding of the trade union representatives that a simple amendment to regulations, to effectively put this duty back on the HSA, would suffice?  If the authority needs additional resources, then so be it and they should be given to it.<\/p> <p>  Meat plants in this country are dominated by a small number of players.

I am the deputy director of veterinary services in the Department of Agriculture and the Marine and I am joined by my colleague, Ms Maria Dunne, who is the head of one of our policy division dealing with the meat and dairy sector.  I have a very brief opening statement after which I will assist the committee in whatever way I can.<\/p> <p>  The Government, as everyone is aware, categorised farming and food production as essential services under the Covid-19 regulations.  Irish food supply chains have continued to operate effectively to ensure continuity and security of supply of safe, healthy Irish food for consumers at home and abroad. <\/p> <p>  A total of 149 meat premises are approved by the Department, with specific approvals for activities, including slaughtering, deboning, cold storage, etc., in the different  sectors of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry and so on.  Of these, 149 plants, the Department has a so-called permanent presence in 49 premises where slaughter of animals takes place.  In the other 100 or so premises, the Department does not have a permanent presence, but carries out risk-based inspections and controls as appropriate. <\/p> <p>  The Department's statutory responsibility in the context of meat plants is to ensure that Department-approved meat plants operate in compliance with the EU food hygiene legislation, animal health legislation and with animal welfare standards.  Approximately 250 veterinary and technical staff from the Department are routinely involved in supervising, regulating and controlling standards at these 149 meat premises.  I should say that this presence is supplemented by contractors and private veterinary practitioners who also provide a meat inspection service within those meat plants, in addition to the Department's permanent staff. <\/p> <p>  In the context of the pandemic, as the committee will be aware, primary responsibility for public health policy and implementation rests with the Department of Health, the HSE and general statutory responsibility for health and safety in the workplace rests with the Health and Safety Authority under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p> <p>  However, as part of the whole-of-Government response to the pandemic, in addition to our statutory role in food safety, animal welfare and animal health, the Department has and will continue to provide any support required to the HSE and the HSA at local and national levels.  So far some of that support provided by our Department has included participation in and contribution to the HSE-chaired National Outbreak Control Team.  This National Outbreak Control Team, NOCT, as the committee will be aware, was set up to deal with Covid-19 outbreaks in meat plants in Ireland.  It is chaired by the HSE and was established in May.<\/p><p>It issued detailed guidance to meat plants on 15 May, including about infection prevention and control measures.  An updated version of this guidance document was issued on 30 June.  This was the first such guidance document that was issued by any country in the EU.  It is an excellent document, and we can talk about that later if necessary.  We disseminated this document to all Department-approved plants on behalf of the HSE on 15 May.  We have since supported the HSE and the HSA in monitoring the effective implementation of all relevant guidance in our Department-approved plants.  This includes the document I have just referred to, the national outbreak control team guidance, as well as the return to work safely protocol.<\/p><p> The support of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the work of the HSA was formalised through a memorandum of understanding agreed between the Department and the authority.  We commenced inspections on behalf of the HSA in the week commencing 20 July in meat plants and other food premises, including dairy plants and other plants in respect of which we have a role.  To date, we have completed 91 such inspections and these inspections are ongoing.  To be clear, these inspections are in plants in addition to the 49 places in which we have a permanent presence.  We expect to have completed the majority of our inspections by the end of next week, Friday, 21 August.  To date, our inspections have shown a high level of compliance.<\/p><p> Since the start of the pandemic, regular meetings have taken place with meat industry representatives, at which it has been emphasised that their priority must be safeguarding human health and following HSE guidance at all levels of operation.  The first of these meetings took place on 11 March and they have continued weekly and fortnightly since then.  Looking back at the period since 11 March, I would say that there has not been a day-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Sheahan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I have to ask Mr. Sheahan to conclude and we will move on to the next speaker.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to come before it today to discuss the current situation in meat processing plants.  The HSA operates under the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and associated regulations.  It is the national body with responsibility to ensure occupational safety, health and welfare for all persons at work.<\/p> <p>  Following the publication of the Return to Work Safely Protocol in early May and the commencement of phase 1 of the roadmap, the authority has conducted 3,820 different inspections and investigations, 2,844 of which addressed Covid measures as set out in the protocol, across all different workplaces and sectors including meat processing plants.  While the authority is overseeing the checks of compliance with the protocol, given the nature of Covid-19, a cross-body inspection and compliance check approach was agreed by the Government.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is co-ordinating the provision of these additional inspection and monitoring mechanisms, which involve more than 500 resources from across the range of statutory bodies.  This is in addition to the authority's existing field inspectors who have been assigned on foot of the protocol.  We have provided the national help file for queries and complaints through our workplace contact unit and, since March, it has dealt with more than 8,000 contacts, with 66% relating to Covid.  These included 21 complaints about meat and food processing plants involving 12 specific employers and 15 requests for information.<\/p> <p>  In early May, the authority became a member of the national outbreak control team that was established to review matters relating to meat processing plants at that time.  Our role there was entirely in the context of occupational health and safety.  Those meat plants were identified by the national outbreak control team and each inspection by the authority involved a full occupational health and safety inspection and a check of compliance with the interim guidance issued by the national outbreak control team as well as the protocol.  The inspection took place across all parts of the plant.  In the main, authority inspections were and are unannounced.  In certain circumstances, however, limited advance notification may be required for operational reasons.  A limited number of inspections may require the co-ordination of resources from a range of State agencies and Departments, which may lead to the employer being notified shortly before the inspection is due to take place.<\/p><p>Inspection visits to MPPs with known outbreaks were pre-advised at short notice to ensure that relevant management and other key personnel were available to meet with us.<\/p><p> Further to our involvement in the NOCT, we originally undertook 33 inspections.  The figure of 34 is in our submission and now we can say there have been 39 inspections.  These inspections included each of those plants connected with an outbreak, along with other plants not associated with any outbreaks.  The inspections involved engagement with all the on-site personnel from management right down to safety representatives and Department of Agriculture and the Marine officials.  Based on the inspections the authority identified a generally high level of compliance with the recommended measures to limit the spread of Covid in a workplace context as set out by the NOCT.<\/p><p> The authority attended a meeting arranged by Department of the Taoiseach about the current outbreaks last week.  We have also been invited to and are engaged in a number of the current local outbreak control teams, OCTs, dealing with specific outbreaks in a number of the plants involved.  A national committee on cases and outbreaks of Covid-19 in high risk settings has been convened under the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and we have attended three meetings of that committee so far.<\/p><p> We recognise the unique challenges posed by Covid-19 and acknowledge the shared responsibility between workers, employers and all of us to limit the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.  It is important to note that an outbreak in a particular setting does not necessarily reflect a poor system of control on behalf of the employer.  Our general experience to date indicates high levels of compliance across sectors and we have found employers, in the main, to be willing to engage and co-operate.<\/p><p> The Health and Safety Authority wants to see all businesses in Ireland reopening as safely and successfully as possible while keeping workers safe too.  We remain committed to working with everyone to support and advise on how to be compliant with the protocol, the interim guidance from the NOCT, and all occupational health and safety measures and we will take appropriate enforcement action as and when needed.<\/p><p> I again express my thanks for the invitation to speak to the committee today and along with my colleague, I am willing to answer any questions or queries members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#JJ00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McGuinness.

I am accompanied today by Mr. Cormac Healy and Mr. Joe Ryan.<\/p> <p>  When we last engaged with the committee, there had been some 22 clusters at primary processing plants.  As we have seen this week, a single primary processing site is unfortunately experiencing its first Covid-19 outbreak.  The original 22 clusters are no longer active clusters and 99% of affected staff have, thankfully, recovered and returned to work.  In the two-month period until 4 August, across all our members&rsquo; sites, just five additional cases had emerged.  Disappointingly, that situation altered last week.  However, it is important to reiterate that the majority of primary processing sites have had zero or very low numbers of positives.<\/p> <p>  In the period since early June we have seen the strong impact of stringent controls and mitigation measures that were put in place early in the pandemic and were strengthened on 15 May with the publication of HSE protocols.  The rigid enforcement of these measures, verified by Government agencies through announced and unannounced audits, has served to reverse the trend of positive cases and restored the overall sector to relative stability.<\/p> <p>  The meat sector was designated by Government as an essential service because it performed services that were deemed necessary for society.  As such, the sector continued to operate while most other non-essential manufacturing sectors were closed.  As a labour-intensive industry, where large groups of workers congregate, the workplace environment was transformed fundamentally to meet complementary objectives: keeping people safe while maintaining business continuity.  We introduced a rapid response in rolling out a comprehensive set of protocols across all sites that, over time and with the benefit of expert advice, enabled us reach the position of stability that has prevailed in recent months in all sites.<\/p> <p>  As we know, Covid-19 travels through communities into industrial settings.  As occupational settings are locations where large numbers of people congregate, they provide the potential for the virus to spread, reflecting the dynamic between community and workplace.  As the pandemic accelerated across society, the HSE identified that many of the positive cases that emerged in meat plants were asymptomatic and were detected as part of wider HSE screening tests.<\/p><p>This process identified clusters where the vast majority of the positive cases were asymptomatic, a finding which reinforced the insidious and indiscriminate nature of the virus and the challenges associated with identifying potential cases.  <\/p><p> In this latest outbreak, there has been a rush to blame and to complain that nothing has been done to mitigate and prevent the virus spread in this industrial setting.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Kildare Chilling survived the high points of late April and early May, recording no virus cases when other clusters formed.  No simple conclusion can therefore be drawn from what has now emerged.  <\/p><p> As we now move toward a new approach to Covid-19 testing, we remain fully committed to public health guidelines, including the additional screening proposals that Government announced in recent days.  However, these can only work to keep people safe while maintaining business continuity if the following steps are put in place: clear and unambiguous advance communication of the screening test protocols to ensure that everyone involved understands the procedures and follow up actions; a speedy and efficient sampling system, with test results returned within 24 hours of the sample being taken; and an effective track and trace system into which MII member companies will continue to record and transmit appropriate information to facilitate contact tracing by the HSE.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, I assure the committee that our industry has worked diligently to protect employees throughout the course of this pandemic and continues to do so.  It took very extensive measures early in the crisis to protect workers and to ensure business continuity.  It continues to update and enhance its protocols in line with all relevant public health guidance.  Vigilance remains the priority.  Our members are proud of their committed workforce and we commend them and all those in the extended supply chain on their efforts during these very difficult times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank members for the invitation to appear before the committee today.  I am the director of Food Drink Ireland and I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Linda Stuart-Trainor, who is our director of prepared consumer foods.<\/p> <p>  Food Drink Ireland is part of IBEC and represents 150 companies across the food and drink industry, including the prepared consumer foods sector and, within that sector, a group of prepared consumer meats companies.  These companies produce cooked, cured and other value-added meat products.  They employ more than 2,800 people and buy over &euro;230 million worth of goods and services domestically every year.  <\/p> <p>  The food industry has been identified as an essential service by Government and so, along with other essential services, has to remain open while dealing with the risks of the pandemic.  Our members have introduced stringent control and mitigation measures since mid-March in addition to fully implementing the prevention and control measures in the national Return to Work Safely Protocol and the specific HSE guidance for meat processing.  The measures include engineering and organisational controls, physical distancing measures such as Perspex screens, enhanced biosecurity measures, temperature checking, training and information, and the provision of personal protective equipment.  Verification of this has been overseen by the Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Agriculture and the Marine.  Both announced and unannounced inspections have taken place in the sector.  <\/p> <p>  Despite the nation&rsquo;s ongoing efforts, the Covid-19 virus remains in our community.  A very unfortunate but inevitable outcome of this is the transmission of the disease within clusters.  Where cases of Covid-19 have been detected, our members have responded in accordance with the specific HSE guidance for meat processing, in particular the steps to be taken when an individual case of Covid-19 is suspected or confirmed and the additional steps to be taken as soon as an outbreak is detected.  Their approaches have been informed by public health expertise at all times and agreed with the HSE through frequent communication.<\/p> <p>  With no clear timeline for the development of a vaccine, it is essential that, as a country and as an economy, we operate responsibly within this uncertainty.  We must take appropriate measures to ensure the continuity of essential businesses and protect our economy.  This must involve Government, public health officials and businesses working together to ensure that there is a proportionate response to outbreaks within the community.  The experience of the sector to date has highlighted a number of key considerations for further testing in communities and workplaces.  With regard to the speed of swabbing and testing, the speed at which positive cases can be identified and isolated from the community and the workplace is vital.  A full site test and turnaround of results within 24 hours is critical.<\/p><p>Without this, there will be problems of business continuity.  Public health authorities must ensure there will be sufficient capacity in the system throughout the testing programme.<\/p><p> On the issue of data protection, GDPR issues are hampering critical information being swiftly provided to site management.  There can be no delay between the communication of results to individuals and to management.  Given the public health imperative, solutions will need to be developed in this area.<\/p><p> In terms of business continuity and sustainability, clarity is needed on outcome scenarios, for instance what number or proportion of the workforce testing positive would trigger specific further responses by the HSE.  These scenarios must be mapped out in a proportionate and co-ordinated way, taking account of the essential nature of food processing and the critical need to keep supply chains open to customers in Ireland and in export markets.  If supply to these customers is interrupted for even a short period that business will not be easily won back.<\/p><p> As our economy and society continues to open up, it is likely that other sectors will experience cases and clusters.  In this context, it is vital that a considered and co-ordinated approach is developed for the food sector, which can be rolled out to other sectors as needed.  This approach must be proportionate, take account of the essential nature of food processing and be grounded in expert advice from the health authorities.  Our members will continue to focus on protecting employees through stringent prevention and control measures and to work with the public health authorities in this regard<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his presentation and for sticking to the time allocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#MM00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for being present.

I will answer some of them and I will ask my colleague, Mr. Cormac Healy, to answer others.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the question on whether mass testing is routine in plants.<\/p><p> There were approximately six plants with large clusters in April and May, when mass testing occurred.  The process was to test all staff on-site, return only the staff who tested negative to the plant and continue in operation subsequently.  At a later point, the individuals who had tested negative were also tested again, meaning there would have been a first round of overall testing and then a second test of people who had tested negative.  This happened in approximately six sites but since that time there has been no mass testing protocol.<\/p><p> We welcome the Government announcement about serial testing.  As I indicated in my opening statement, it is critical that there is an effective track and trace system with a very quick response time of between 12 and 24 hours for results.  We need to have clear and unambiguous advance communication of how these protocols will operate.  The Deputy asked about HSA inspections.  As I stated at my previous appearance before the committee, we welcome and encourage unannounced inspections.  We have absolutely no difficulty with that.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about virus spread in plants and whether systems within plants would accelerate it.  There is a hypothesis as to why large clusters of Covid-19 may have occurred in some meat plants and not in others.  This is based on two assumptions, with the first being that a super-spreading event may have occurred within each of those plants in which large numbers of workers tested positive, and the second being that aerosol transmission of infection or dispersal of virus from an infected person over distances greater than 2 m could occur.

I will start with the representatives from the HSA.  I thank them for their contributions.  Other witnesses spoke at our earlier session about various regulations that could have been put in place but that are not in place.  I refer specifically to the categories of notifiable illnesses in this regard.  If a worker at a meat plant or any other workplace contracts an infectious disease, whether contracted in work or brought in, there is no obligation to report that to the HSA.  However, if a worker were to trip on loose machinery or injure himself or herself on a floorboard, that would have to be reported.  There seems to be a lacuna.  I am aware that this requirement was included in the primary legislation, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, and was then taken out on foot of a ministerial order in 2016.  We have heard testimony from the unions that it would be very helpful to reintroduce that requirement.  What are the HSA's views on the matter?  It is my understanding, and perhaps the witnesses can elaborate on this, that were Covid a notifiable illness, the HSA would have a range of sanctions, powers and inspections available to it and its teams.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#QQ00100","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will go back to the point I made already.  This is a public health-led initiative.  There is a pandemic going on and, therefore, the infectious disease regulations under public health are the primary legislation whereby a doctor or someone in a laboratory has to report this illness.  It is very important that those regulations are in place because this is not a once-off.  It does not just affect one worker and then stops.  It can affect that one worker, his or her co-workers, family and colleagues when he or she goes out socialising.  It is important that public health takes the lead on this.  If we do not lead this as a public health matter, the impact will go from the workplace out to society and back in again.<\/p> <p>  As regards notifiable diseases, we are working with the outbreak control teams.  We are aware of where the outbreaks are occurring and are engaging with them as they happen.  The primary driver in all this effort must be getting the outbreak under control.  It is in everybody's interest to do that.  That is why it has to be led in this way.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the legislative basis for reporting.  There is a lot of different legislation.  Under the current 2005 legislation and our general application regulations, fatalities and accidents are reported by the employer.  The employers know what is happening on the ground and they can report that.  That is the case in many of these meat plants.  I know of one where an injury was reported just recently.  Employers will often not know the result of a test as the worker may not have told them, which is why public health and infectious disease regulations are primary here.  We are looking at that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#QQ00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but I am conscious that we are short on time.  I agree with Dr. McGuinness that the primary legislation, which in this case is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, is paramount.  All other regulations, secondary legislation and ministerial orders are delegated legislation.  The constitutional power of the Oireachtas is in passing primary legislation and that is what we are dealing with here.  I take Dr. McGuinness' view that it may not be appropriate to include this requirement in that legislation but that was not the view held by the Oireachtas when it passed it in 2005, or while it was enforced for 11 years subsequently.  A Minister then took it on himself to change those regulations.  Perhaps there was lobbying; perhaps not.  However, that was a secondary measure and the primary legislation is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  I wonder whether it was <i>ultra vires<\/i>to take that requirement out afterwards by ministerial order, as it was a primary Act being changed?<\/p><p>Are the inspectors in workplaces all HSA staff?

Its conclusion highlighted widespread improper relationships between the beef industry and Government.  A shocking set of scandals was uncovered and virtually nothing happened.  No one was held to account and public trust was totally eroded.  If we fast-forward to today, for months journalists have reported that workers are frightened to speak out about their horrendous working conditions without anonymity for fear of retribution.

The meat industry is still worth billions of euros and yet the budget set aside for inspections in comparison to this is a pittance.  Of the 15,338 meat plant workers, 8,896 are migrant workers.  The non-EU workers are bound to their employers by their work permits.  Some 90% of workers get no sick pay so they are of course more likely to turn up for work if they have symptoms of Covid-19.  There has not been a ban on subcontracting in this sector.  <\/p><p> The Minister for Health has said that he personally thinks that factories with clusters should close.  The T&aacute;naiste has said that the power exists under the public health legislation for the HSE to order businesses to close and yet this did not happen.<\/p><p> Our Government has closed down entire counties and hundreds of businesses but somehow lacks the power to close plants with confirmed clusters.  That these plans have since voluntarily closed is irrelevant at this point.<\/p><p> History has shown us that this industry has very considerable political clout and that the Government has turned a blind eye to the industry&rsquo;s scandalous failings in the past.  Objectively, it is completely unreasonable to ask other businesses where there have been no outbreaks to close while allowing the main source of these clusters to remain open.

We believe the lockdown was completely unjustified and that the constituency is being punished for the inaction of the national outbreak control team and the Government in getting to grips with the problem in meat factories.  That is the outline of this.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  My first is for Mr. Healy.  There is huge concern among farmers.  Farmers and workers have been treated very badly by the meat factories.  I have been very consistent in saying that and I say it again today.  They have been very badly treated.  The price of beef has slightly improved and not before time.  I want assurances that this crisis will not be used as an excuse to cut the price of beef for beef and suckler farmers.  They cannot take any more hits and I want assurances on that from Mr. Healy.  What is Meat Industry Ireland doing to ensure that this does not happen because we need to protect our producers and workers?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the 24 hour testing time, which I welcome.  Does MII agree with the Government's approach that the duration of the testing should be four weeks?  I suspect it should be much  longer than four weeks because we saw 828 cases of Covid in meat factories in May and we now have well over 1,400.  I want to know what MII's views are on the duration of testing.  I also want a response to my query on farmers.<\/p> <p>  Is the fact that an employer cannot contact the HSA directly if there is a Covid case in a plant a barrier and an obstacle ?  It is very clear that we have not got to grips with this problem and other people, constituents and regions are suffering as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#YY00600","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>Our work and focus continues to be around protocols and dealing with the new testing regime.

Across the European economy, there has been some reopening of economies and some recovery in food service which has helped.  Where it goes from here I do not know, but every effort is made to find the best markets delivering the best return.  The price is stronger than it was at this time last year.<\/p> <p>  On the specific question about the four weeks' duration of testing, I understand from the Government's announcements thus far that it is proposing serial testing similar to what has been done in other areas.<\/p><p>It is proposed that testing be carried out weekly for four weeks in order to root out the problem, if there is one.  I cannot offer advice on that.  I would like to think that, across the wide range of plants out there, this testing will not find much.  Many plants have had few or no cases.  As our chairman said in his opening statement, during the two months up to early August there were only five individual cases among our primary meat-processing members.

The first or primary function of the Health and Safety Authority under the Act is the prevention of personal injury which, as I have said, includes disease.<\/p> <p>  As the authority's representatives have said, and as we now understand, the regulations do not impose a duty on employers to notify anyone of an outbreak of disease or infection within the place of employment.  There is such a duty in respect of any other type of personal injury.  I believe I am correct in saying that, at the moment, if an employee tells management that he or she has tested positive for Covid, that it appears he or she has had it for a number of days or even a week, and that he or she has been interacting with other staff within the place of work, the employer has no duty to notify the Health and Safety Authority of that.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions.  Is the Health and Safety Authority satisfied that the regulations as set out and the factual situation are in harmony with the Act and the HSA's duties thereunder?

We are reviewing the matter as we speak within the authority and we will bring forward a discussion paper in due course for the Department and our board.<br\/><br\/>I feel we have the required level of connection with public health.  I go back to the point, which is really important, that an individual might have Covid and tell his employer, but it is not necessarily the case that he got it in the workplace.  He could have got it out playing sport or out socialising.  He could have been on leave or whatever else.  It is a difficult one because, in effect, the reporting relates to the work activity and that is the challenge we have.

Meat plants are dominated by a small number of big players.  I would argue that the reputation of meat plants is pretty much in tatters.  Are meat plants on a self-destructive pathway?

Unfortunately, we now have one plant that has had an outbreak.  Not all the information is known about that, but the plant had gone through the entire period of the pandemic, since the middle of March, without a single case.  We continue to work on that.

They would have been forced to tend to their intimate hygiene practically in the open.

Mr. Healy said that Covid-19 travels through communities into the industrial settings rather than <i>vice versa<\/i>, which to a degree is true.  However, we have heard of workers who are living within their own community.  They frequently live in overcrowded conditions and lack the necessary space and privacy we all deserve as human beings.  There has been talk of hotbeds where one staff member gets up and another person gets into their bed.  I was talking about the balance of power there.  These workers are further disadvantaged because they are here in Ireland under the work permit regime.  Some 80% of the workers are not born in Ireland; they are foreign workers who have been brought in.  They are tied to their employers and their employment.  Wage deductions are made for accommodation.  It reminds me of the indentured servitude we hear about in the Middle East where migrant workers are abused like this.  Mr. Healy said he does not believe agency work is that big a factor.  It is called precarious employment.  I think it is bogus self-employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#BBB01000","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The Deputy might want to conclude to allow the witness to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#CCC00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Healy to respond to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#CCC00300","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify that 20% of the workforce rather than 80% of the workforce are on work permits.

There is a requirement that the employer would work with a permit holder to source accommodation.  The workers are not committed to using that, but many of them will use it in the first instance.  I believe that accommodation is also checked to verify that piece of the permit legislation is being done and that the employer is helping them sourcing accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that the hot-bedding, as was referred to, should not be tolerated.

I must put it to him that, the day after it was announced that we would not move to phase 4, the acting Chief Medical Officer cited 12 cases of infection in the hospitality sector over the previous week, which were partly used to justify not moving to phase 4 and opening up many rural pubs.  The difference strikes me.  We have heard about 30 announced inspections and how many meat plants have not even been inspected.

The first, of which the committee will be aware but it is important to reiterate what we know and what we do not know, is that Covid-19 is a serious and scary disease.  We heard this morning that workers in meat packing factories are petrified about going to work and that Covid-19 causes death and disability.  There is increasing emerging evidence of the long-term consequences, the so-called \"long Covid\".  <\/p> <p>  Second, we know that we can stop the virus.  There is evidence from different parts of the world where suppression strategies and going on to elimination have been successful.  We also know that closer to home, Ireland&rsquo;s response to Covid-19 early on was very effective.  We saw that due to our efforts as a people, we avoided swamping our health service with the so-called surge and worked together to suppress the curve.  The problem and challenge that we are facing now is that, more recently, the policy has become one of suppression of the virus to a so-called tolerable level.  This is the idea of living with the virus.  The challenge with that is that we are always seven to ten days behind the virus in our response.  While we saw the success of the efforts that we made together and the declining number of cases, we have seen more recently how quickly that can change.  The rising number of cases over the past few weeks has focused minds on where we go next.<\/p> <p>  The third reason we are here advocating for a zero-Covid island strategy is that we need clear and decisive action.  We need our population to understand the goal that we are all working towards together and what we need to do to get there.  We have seen that the Irish population can work to flatten the curve and we now need to work together to stop the curve.<\/p> <p>  I will explain what we mean by our zero-Covid island strategy.  We are defining this as the absence for a suitable period of time of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  How do we get there?  We need leadership and we need our Government to be clear that will take a policy of elimination.  The types of measures that we will need to take as a population are those that we are becoming increasingly familiar with.  These are strong adherence to hand hygiene and cough etiquette with regular hand washing, being really consistent with our physical distancing, the widespread use of masks, especially indoors, and we need to have more active case finding, testing, tracing, and better support for isolation.  We are also advocating that there will be no non-essential travel into what we are calling green zones.  This is an approach which we will take within the island which my colleague, Professor Anthony Staines, will describe in more detail.  We are also advocating for no non-essential foreign travel with testing, isolation and tracking the movements of incoming people at ports and airports.  The reason for this is that we will have a shared goal and work together to support the recovery of our economy and society.  Professor Staines will now give some more detail on the green zone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#QQQ00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Patricia Kearney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>There are two other pieces in this.  There are a number of objections posed to this is a policy, the most fundamental being that all of the pieces that are used to make it happen are imperfect.  One of the central messages of public health is that if one does things which are in themselves imperfect but one does several of them, one can get really good results.  There is also a great concern about further damage to the economy, which I believe Mr. O&rsquo;Brien will address in a little while.  We simply make the point that the limited evidence that is available, which is from the United States where every conceivable variety of lockdown has been tried and from South Korea where no lockdown was tried, is that the economic damage in a region of those countries was much more strongly related to the amount of infection.  It really is the virus that drives the economic damage.  This is the same as the message that comes from analysis of the 1918-19 flu.<\/p> <p>  The logic of the green zones is that there are many areas of the country where there are very few cases and these are mostly rural counties.<\/p><p>Roscommon is a good example.  In those areas, it is relatively straightforward to stop the disease completely.  As one gets areas to green, one can merge those areas and produce a larger and larger green area which covers the country.  That is the position we were in in early June and we can absolutely get back to that position again because we have already done it.  One goes from managing one outbreak which is spreading across the country, affecting many different counties, to 26 smaller outbreaks, many of which are tiny and involve single families or individuals and can be dealt with effectively and stopped from spreading effectively.  In the areas in which infection is driven to zero, in green zones, which would initially be county-level areas, life can return substantially to normal.  The price of that is no non-essential travel into those areas from other parts of the country.  The plan is to expand those areas as quickly as possible to cover the entire country, hopefully in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Government, where there is a long history of co-operation, to extend it to cover the entire island.<\/p><p> It is the view of colleagues of ours who have dealt with epidemics of things like Ebola, malaria and cholera in the most difficult circumstances imaginable that this is entirely feasible.  It is also a view supported by the evidence from other countries.  One gets to the situation in New Zealand.  In New Zealand, there has been an outbreak in the past two days which appears to have been caused by failure in the quarantine in one city.  In that city, life is severely disrupted but the outbreak will be brought under control and life and business continue on the rest of the island.  We are bringing our children back to school in September and it is crucially important that we do so.  All the international evidence says that the lower the amount of this virus circulating in our communities, the safer it is for our children to return to school.<\/p><p> The alternative of living with the virus is difficult, as the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly have discovered in the past week or so.  Our expectation is that if we continue to live with the virus, such outbreaks, with rolling closures, will be a feature of life until a vaccine is available.  It will be the middle of next year, June 2021 at the earliest if everything goes well, before large supplies of a vaccine are available for our population.  If things do not go well, it could be a lot longer and we could be waiting for quite some time for a vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#QQQ00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Anthony Staines","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Every country now faces extreme and unprecedented uncertainty.  Never in my lifetime has it been more difficult to predict how the economy and indeed the world will look in a year&rsquo;s time.  The scale of the human cost of Covid-19 is well known and well articulated by those with medical expertise.  The scale of the impact on livelihoods is less clear at this juncture even if it is visible in plain sight almost everywhere one looks.<\/p> <p>  I have two opening observations.  Economies are like living organisms.  A view commonly espoused since the pandemic struck is that they can be placed in deep freeze, but they cannot.  Just as human cells quickly start to die off when starved of oxygen, the businesses which form the economy die off if deprived of trade.<\/p><p> My second observation is that the greatest economic cost of Covid is not the deficits governments almost everywhere are running in order to increase healthcare provision, support household incomes and save businesses, however huge those deficits are.  It is instead the economic activity that has not happened as a result of the pandemic.  The wealth that is not being created or the wealth that has been lost has been lost forever and this will have consequences down the line.<\/p><p> The scale of the slowdown in economic activity is becoming clear slowly as economic indicators for recent months become available around the world.  Only yesterday our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, reported its figures for gross domestic product - the widest measure of economic activity - for the second quarter of this year, which was the worst period of the pandemic.  In April, May and June, wealth creation in the UK collapsed by almost a quarter compared with the final quarter of 2019.  That is a contraction utterly without precedent.  The eurozone and the United States, which are, along with the UK, Ireland's most important trade and investment partners, have recorded slightly smaller contractions, albeit ones of historically large magnitude.  Irish GDP data have yet to be published for that period and there is reason to believe that the headline contraction in activity here will be slightly less than in peer countries.  However, there is also no doubt about the scale of the shock to the Irish economy from a range of available indicators, most notably those from the labour market.  The latest data from the Central Statistics Office show that 500 million people were in receipt of jobless benefits of some kind in July.  That figure is higher than at the worst point of the previous recession, which was itself a historically deep recession.  Almost as many people again are having their wages and salaries subsidised.  If one includes public sector workers, approximately half of the entire workforce is being supported by the State.<\/p><p> The single most important factor in ensuring the State can borrow to pick up the cost of these emergency measures is the willingness of the European Central Bank, ECB, to effectively print money.  The ECB is committed to maintaining its pandemic purchase programme into next year.  When and how it unwinds this programme is yet another source of great uncertainty.<\/p><p> As recently as 70 years ago, seven people died every day on average in the Republic from tuberculosis out of a much smaller population.  The emergence of Covid-19 is in some ways returned to past times when fear of contracting a deadly disease was so prevalent.  Our parents, grandparents and the generation before them lived with that disease.  We will have to find ways of living with Covid as they did with tuberculosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#RRR00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

There are two schools of thought between endemic disease versus this strategy of elimination and I think it is incredibly important that the first thing one does is be very clear about what that actually means.  Words like &ldquo;suitable period of time&rdquo; are unhelpful given the uncertainties, so one needs to be very clear about that definition.  If one thinks about endemic, then it is a disease or condition that is regularly found among people in a certain area.<\/p> <p>  What we know is that this pathogen is now endemic in every part of the world.  I will come back to New Zealand, but it is out there.  The idea that we are going to eliminate it globally is a misnomer now.  It is a problem if one is pursuing that path.  When one refers to an elimination of a disease, then that is a deliberate effort that leads to a reduction to zero of the incidence of an infection caused by SARS in a defined geographic area.  It is also important whether one is talking about Ireland or about southern Ireland.  One can class elimination from a specific region without it being eradicated globally.  There are examples of that like polio and measles, but it is important to understand that there are only two pathogens that can come under the list of where we have had complete global elimination of diseases: we have got smallpox and rinderpest.  They have three things in their favour when one goes for elimination.  They have an effective vaccine in place.  They have no animal host as humans are the only vectors.  Third, they have a political will globally to succeed in elimination.  When I hear that school of thought around elimination I ask how are we informing this on what we have done previously.  How are we considering that this is a zoonotic pathogen that communicates to animals and back, and has multiple routes of transmission?<\/p> <p>  The fact has been alluded to that lots of people use New Zealand as an example, and there are some helpful examples between it and Ireland.  The countries have a very similar population of about 4.9 million, but in terms of density, we are talking about 15 per sq. km in New Zealand, whereas there is about a fourfold increase in Ireland.  Ireland is much more densely populated than New Zealand.  In addition, when one talks about New Zealand, one has to consider that its nearest neighbour is more than 1,000 km away, that is Australia, which is also one of the least densely populated countries in the world.  I think that any comparison with New Zealand is unhelpful because not only is it locking down, it has to lock out.  One cannot have a sort of all-or-nothing strategy.<\/p><p>There must be a strategy.  Where countries have done this, such as in Hong Kong or New Zealand, we are talking about quarantine in hotels for two weeks and testing.  Once people are let out, problems emerge.  That is important.<\/p><p> With evidence gathering there is much uncertainty about what will happen next.  We can look at the age structure of Ireland, for example, with a median age of 36.5 compared with 40.5 in the United Kingdom.  We modelled this and examined deaths and there would be 10,000 fewer deaths because of that age structure.  When people are doing comparisons, they must really bring in nuanced evidence to understand it.<\/p><p> We are talking about an elimination strategy and I have read the emails, and there is much emotion about such matters.  We try to focus on the evidence.  Whatever the strategy, and whether one is in the Sweden camp or the Spain camp, where they locked down very hard instead of keeping society going, there is the same problem that we have and that Ireland has.  In Ireland, 62% of deaths were associated with care homes.  It is still not clear to me why governments and their policy have not understood that this is where the problem is.<\/p><p> Looking at the age structure of who is affected by the disease, I have never seen a disease like it where age has such a major impact.  We should remember that with influenza we saw many deaths in people under five but we are not getting that problem now.  Fewer than 400 people aged under 50 with no comorbidities have died of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.  That is an incredibly small number.  We can assume that the biggest problem in the middle age group is dealing with comorbidities and this is most important.  The decision today if we go down the elimination strategy is to make it exactly clear what is being done, what evidence this is based on and, in doing that, what may potentially be ignored where the strategy is more important.  I still do not see the urgency around protecting care homes and thinking through the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#UUU00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Carl Heneghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Heneghan.

I am a part of the United Kingdom Government's Scientific Advisory Group in Emergencies, SAGE, specifically the behavioural science advisory group.  I am also a member of Independent SAGE, which works in parallel with the Government's SAGE committee.<\/p> <p>  Independent SAGE has really considered the evidence for many of the issues that have arisen.  The three overarching concerns we have been addressing is how to minimise death and disability, how to promote and help to maintain as many jobs and get the economy going as efficiently and as soon as possible and also how to open schools safely.  When it comes to jobs and workplaces, we are also talking about safety.<\/p> <p>  Our view is we have approximately three to four weeks before the autumn, cold weather and a decrease in the level of ultraviolet radiation sets in that will pose new challenges for us in driving down Covid-19.  The influenza season will also set in.  We speak about elimination but I will clarify the terminology, as I believe Professor Heneghan was referring to eradication.  That is not what we are talking about; we are talking about elimination.<\/p> <p>  I could use the analogy of fires.  In Ireland, like the United Kingdom, there is a zero fire policy, which means we want no fires and we take every measure we can to ensure, as much as we can, that there are no fires.  However, we know fires will occasionally break out and we have systems in place to jump on those fires quickly so they do not spread into the awful examples we saw in Australia last year arising from large forest fires.  That is what elimination and zero-Covid means.<\/p> <p>  I will try to add to what has already been said.<\/p><p>We feel very strongly that health and wealth should not be pitted against each other.  We want to increase business and consumer confidence.  To achieve both of those things we need transmission rates in the community to be at an absolute minimum alongside effective test, trace and isolate systems and, as has been previously said, border controls.  As a behavioural scientist, I am especially interested in the behavioural aspects of the test, trace and isolate system, which needs to be addressed to make it effective.  I am sorry to say we have not yet achieved that in the UK for various reasons which we may get on to.<\/p><p> Would the population really go with what is needed to eliminate coronavirus and reach a Covid-zero situation?  It would mean over the next three or four weeks taking every measure, which includes restrictions and probably more restrictions than Ireland has at the moment on the basis that it would then allow the certainty and confidence which the business community and the population in general so want to be able to get on with their lives and their jobs.<\/p><p> The experience in Ireland, as in the UK and many other countries, is that when it is explained to the population why measures are needed, even though those measures require sacrifice on their behalf, they will adhere to them as we saw with the original lockdown.  A couple of things are really important here.  It is not only telling people what to do, but explaining the rationale so that people understand it.  I believe that people would understand a zero-Covid policy if it was put to them.  Also required is trusted leadership to communicate that in appropriate ways to the population and to do so with an understanding of which parts of the population find adherence most challenging.  In the UK, as I suspect is the case in Ireland, it is young people and especially young men.  It is very important to tailor strategies to those groups, using role models of various kinds like sportspeople, musicians and other celebrities.<\/p><p> This needs to be done in partnership and in consultation with the community so that as much as possible the policies are thought through together and the strategies to achieve the aims of the policies are co-produced with the community and not imposed from the top down on the community.  I am happy to expand more on these points and other points during discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#VVV00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Susan Michie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I thank the many witnesses who are taking part.

I suppose it comes back to the distinction made by Professor Michie between eradication versus elimination versus suppression.  To be clear, eradication, which Professor Heneghan spoke about, is when the virus is gone completely from the world.  That is not what we are proposing.  Elimination, which we are talking about, involves eliminating community transmission.  We understand that there is still the possibility that people will cross our borders and come in but we would have appropriate measures in place so that if a person who is Covid-positive comes in, we can detect that, he or she can be isolated and we can avoid any further transmission of the virus.  That, essentially, is an elimination strategy.  We eliminate community transmission.  What we have in Ireland at the moment is suppression.  That made sense early on when we were still learning about this disease and when the focus was very much on not overwhelming our health system.  It was also informed by responses, for example, to flu outbreaks.  It was very much about trying to flatten the curve.  What we have learned, and what is very clear in our experience in Ireland in the past few weeks, is that this virus will bounce back if given the opportunity to do so.

We managed to bring the rates of viral infection down to very low levels by the beginning of June.  Again, that was not guaranteed, but it was done.

In many ways, perhaps us listening to that more would be useful but I suppose where we, as public representatives, can contribute to the debate is in our experience of dealing with the general public.  There was much talk at the beginning of this pandemic about flattening the curve - a well-understood and well-communicated concept - but when we got to the end of the process in that regard, we did not have a conversation with the people about the point at which we wanted to plateau.  Looking at the United States, it is clear that it is plateauing at a very high, and perhaps unacceptable, rate.  Then one looks at Ireland and Scotland, which have a much more conservative approach, and New Zealand.  We must yet have that debate with the public because, even at the height of the pandemic and the debate on flattening the curve, there were people who clung to the rules and who wanted more rules and there were those who were willing to ignore them.  In the past week or two, I have noticed increasingly different shades of opinion, with some even saying they do not believe this pandemic is real.  It is clear that the pandemic is real and that is having a real impact on people's health and lives, but what is being said by some demonstrates how we need to bring the public with us in whatever debate we have.<\/p> <p>  On Professor Staines six recommendations regarding how we get to a zero-Covid island, a previous speaker indicated that it is really about a stricter implementation of what we currently have.  I refer, for example, to the communications strategy in respect of hand hygiene and social distancing, the increased use of masks indoors, the commitment given by the Minister yesterday that we will sustain the level of track and tracing, the closure of some counties - and the consequent prevention of travel - and the instruction by Government on non-essential foreign travel.  At the same time, we are leaving the latter to the discretion of individuals.  In many ways, Ireland is pursuing the strategy which Professor Staines has outlined.  Am I correct in saying that he would like to see the prevalence of the disease plateau at a lower level?  In many ways, we have made the decision to try to be as conservative as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#BBBB00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McAuliffe.  From my perspective, we are trying to do something very difficult.  We are trying to live with this virus.  The Government has articulated that policy clearly.  However, it is very difficult to keep the number of cases at 20 or 30 a day.  The likely outcome is that we will have periodic flares similar to those in Kildare, Laois and Offaly in other parts of the country.  The endgame is that this will continue until such time as a vaccine becomes available.  Hopefully, a vaccine will be available by the middle of next year but, as Mr. O'Brien articulated, if one never becomes available, we have to think about this differently.  I am optimistic that there will be a vaccine in the not-too-distant future.

It becomes difficult for businesses to make plans, particularly small, family-run businesses, which make up a large part of employment both in urban and rural Ireland.

What does one do if, for example, we open schools in Clare, as we fully intend to do at the beginning of September, and then a week later there is a lockdown in the county?  The lower the circulation of the virus in the community, the safer the schools are.  The basic point is that low-level circulation of this virus is like a fire in the wall of one's house.  It is hard to confine it to one small area of the wall.  It is likely to spread unpredictably.  Bringing the virus down to zero, as the Deputy described, is an intensification of the measures we are currently taking.

We are talking about many more clear policies to get down to zero and then when there is a period of zero it is time to open up and that is what New Zealand's policy is.

People are coming forward with simple proposals to say we will have a zero-Covid policy and that we can have non-essential travel, etc.  If we go down that line, we have to be clear and the policies have to say we will follow a path to zero Covid.

In all these situations three things need to be in place.  People need to have the knowledge of what they are and are not allowed to do, and for that clear and consistent information must be provided.  Secondly, they need to be motivated; I will come back to that.  Thirdly, they need to have the opportunity, and use of environment is extremely helpful in terms of supporting behaviour change.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of pubs, I mention meals versus no meals, absolutely, as was suggested.  If people are sitting down and those seats are spaced then one is much more likely to have social distancing than if people are moving around.  We know that alcohol disinhibits behaviour.  We have seen with alcohol that even when people have good intentions or are motivated, after a couple of drinks they forget and hug each other, are near to each other and are face to face, etc.  Eating food tends to reduce the amount of alcohol consumed and the impact of the alcohol on people's behaviour.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Professor Heneghan that in order to get to zero Covid there needs to be clear, specific, precise policies.  The statement being presented today is about an idea and it needs to be followed up with a statement about what those policies will look like.  However, in all the cases it is important to motivate people and to take the population with the Government, as I have said before. <\/p> <p>  One thing that has been shown to be effective in that regard is getting people to think not just about themselves but about their families, their communities and societies.  We need to get people to think about the \"we\" and about other people.  It is about using a moral leadership to motivate people to comply with adhering to the spirit as well as, if relevant, the law of what is essential travel.  It is about getting tested when one suspects one is ill, giving contacts, which is often a tricky thing to do, and about isolating.  These are difficult things to achieve and one needs public health expertise to achieve them.  <\/p> <p>  Importantly, I said one needs to have knowledge and motivation but also, the opportunity.  Isolation is key to this strategy, and test, trace and isolate is key to achieving zero Covid.  We need to make sure that people are not disincentivised, that is, if a person is going to lose money because he or she cannot work then he or she should have financial compensation.  If a person is unable to isolate at home, he or she should be offered alternative accommodation.  This is being done in those countries that have successfully kept community transmission low, even quite poor countries like Vietnam and places like Kerala that have been outstanding in their achievements.  They have made sure it is not just about people knowing and being motivated but about enabling and supporting them to do that.  That is an important message to take into all the areas being considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#FFFF00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Susan Michie"},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in.  It has been extremely informative.  I want to put a couple of questions to the experts about how we could leverage different types of testing to establish the green zones we are talking about which is more about finding out where the virus is not as opposed to where the virus is.  The first of those questions will go to Professors Kearney and Staines.  Has there been any consideration of the use of pool testing whereby we test large numbers of samples, perhaps 100 plus at any one time?  That would exponentially increase the capacity for testing but it would also be relevant for something like international air travel where one might be able to test a full planeload at a time.<\/p><p>If one got an all-clear for that planeload, one would know that everyone on board was in the clear.  It would also be useful for the meat industry to be able to test on a factory by factory basis.  Has that been given any consideration as part of the zero-Covid plan?<\/p><p> A related matter, on which Professor Michie might be able to respond, is sewage epidemiology or wastewater testing on which a good deal of research has been done in universities, including in Newcastle, Bangor and Edinburgh.  I am given to understand that it is possible to test for Covid-19 in wastewater systems and this may be able to give us an indication of prevalence.  For example, in my home town of Tramore one could test and find there is no Covid with the sewage and wastewater system, which would allow the establishment of a green zone.  One of the objectives Professor Staines is driving towards is establishing green zones and merging them as one finds and eradicates the virus from different settings.

My clinical colleagues tell me that the clinical picture is quite distinct.  It is the speed of chasing the contacts of that person, identifying them, getting them to isolate and testing them that brings the rate to zero.  We are doing this much faster than we were doing it but it is not yet fast enough.  There are too many people where it is taking too long to trace the contacts.  We are also having a problem where some contacts decline to engage with testing.  That is partly about messaging and changing people&rsquo;s behaviour.

I want to speak to the issue of trust because there is a lot of evidence that trust is really important in getting people to adhere to any policy.  Test, trace and isolate requires trust.  This is because the trace part of it, the tracing and revealing of contacts, means giving information about contacts.  In the UK we have two parallel systems at the moment.<\/p><p>One system is run by a national commercial organisation that has call centres, so people get phone calls from people they do not know.  Under the other system, local public health officials contact people.  The latter has shown to be much more effective and much of the reason for this is trust.  People need to be able to trust where their data are going and that, if they provide information about contacts, that data will be respected and there will not be a punitive policy under which these contacts will be asked to quarantine without the necessary support.  Achieving this requires an understanding of the communities.  This is where local knowledge comes in.  At airports, which do not have that local community feel, some kind of follow-up is important to ensure that people are quarantining.  That is, in fact, important in all of this.<\/p><p> This should not be done in a punitive way but in a way that indicates how very important society thinks these measures are and which shows that society is prepared to put resources into follow-up.  In countries in which this has been successful, the process has been based on shoe leather - going from door to door and knocking to see whether people are in and if they need any help to carry on isolating.  That is the sort of approach that has been successful.  This whole area requires a lot of consideration, thought and behavioural advice if one is to get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#JJJJ01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Susan Michie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":683,"content":"<p>May I ask a follow-up question on the issue of trust?  We initially approached this with a view to flattening the curve.

We aimed to avoid scenes such as had been seen in the north of Italy and Madrid.  We then moved towards a view that not everyone would get the virus and that we could protect everyone from it.  We became more ambitious in our aims.  In the view of the panel, does that shifting of the objective undermine trust?  We had believed that everybody would come into contact with it.  We did not aim for herd immunity but we believed that, sooner or later, everybody in the herd would come into contact with the disease, as they do with influenza or the common cold which, although I am not a scientist, I understand is a coronavirus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#KKKK00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I can certainly talk about the pattern of what happened in the UK.  There were a couple of things that led to a real decrease in trust and an associated drop in adherence.  One of these was the very mixed messaging with regard to opening up the economy, which focused on very vague ideas such as staying alert and controlling the virus.  People got confused and a bit alienated as a result.  In the UK, there were two or three days when people close to the scientists and politicians were mentioning the concept of herd immunity.  That resulted in a real outcry because such a small percentage of the population would have had any kind of build-up of antibodies.  We already know that it is about 6% which means that 94% do not have such antibodies.  We do not know whether antibodies translate into immunity and, if they do, how much immunity and for how long.  This is really not a viable strategy without tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths.  This is why Independent SAGE, the Scottish Government and others are considering a zero-Covid strategy.  I have heard the British Medical Association is also going to endorse it.  In the UK, the lack of a strategy and the chopping and changing of advice to people is one of the reasons trust continues to be very low.  Having an overarching strategy and measures therein which the population understand will engender trust.  The population can be brought along with that, with clear leadership.

Our two airlines are both haemorrhaging money and the one that used to be the national airline is in severe difficulty.  The aviation sector represents approximately 9% of the economy.  Would the witnesses be prepared to modify their plan to allow for random testing of airline passengers coming into the country?  If a flight has 200 passengers, we could pick out ten or 20 to be tested and try to see what is the rate of infection in those, regardless of whether they are coming from green zones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#LLLL00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597273200,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I understand the point the Deputy makes and I thank him for the question.  The problem with modern airline traffic is that one might have people on an aeroplane who are coming from 40 different places.  They may all have got on an aeroplane in Birmingham but they could have come to Birmingham from literally the four corners of the world.  There is a real challenge with bringing airline traffic up to its previous levels.  Airline freight is a different story.  Air crews are a manageable number but I do not see that there will be a return to the scale of passenger air traffic that we have been accustomed to for some time to come.  Mr. O'Brien might have a better idea about that than I would.<\/p> <p>  It is possible to do random testing.  The problem with it is that the test itself is about 70% reliable.  Once one tests a sample of passengers on an aeroplane, for example, with an unreliable test, the reliability goes down another few notches in terms of answering the question of whether there is someone on the aeroplane who can transmit Covid.  There is enormous work being done on Covid testing, which I only dimly understand, so I would expect that the quality of testing will go up and the price and speed of testing will go down.  At the moment, with the tests we are currently using, I think most of us in public health would advocate testing everyone on the aeroplane.

Sweden had no lockdown and very high death rates.  Denmark had a lockdown, with much lower death rates.  Studies within the United States and South Korea both suggest the same idea, that the regional economic damage was not driven by government and state response to infection but was driven very directly by the rate of infection itself.

Recessions are extremely bad for countries.  We know that in this country and we had a very bad one between 2008 and 2012.  Recessions cause social, political, economic and health damage.  This one also risks intergenerational conflict, as we should be absolutely clear that younger people are at a very low risk of death from this disease.  It risks bringing out intergenerational conflict if younger people, who are always most severely damaged by recessions, end up in long-term mass unemployment because of what is happening.<\/p> <p>  There was a specific question about the European Central Bank.  The existing pandemic purchase programme, which is effectively money printing for governments, is due to last into the spring of next year.  It is very unlikely anything will happen to disrupt that so governments should be free to borrow and spend until that point.  Thereafter, some divisions among member states may emerge in terms of the risk associated with money printing.  We should be clear that if money printing was a way of making everybody rich, poverty would have disappeared 500 years ago with the invention of printing presses.  It is an emergency measure that will not go on forever.  We certainly would not want to bank on it for a long time past next spring.

For instance, the committee just heard about Vietnam.  It is a classic fallacy.  The median age in Vietnam is 30.5 years.  The temperature and humidity are radically different from here.  We do not even know whether people in Vietnam have pre-existing infections, cross-reactively, from SARS-CoV-1, of which it had outbreaks.  With these issues, people say \"here is the evidence and because they did that, we are going to do this\".  I find that very difficult to understand from an evidence-based perspective.<\/p> <p>  Second, we have heard much about pubs.  Pubs are interesting.  People talk emotively about what we should do and say we should close the pubs.  Ireland has 7,200 pubs while the UK  has 47,600.  In the UK, we have had fewer than ten outbreaks.  Every pub is an outlier and it is an opportunity to study what is going on.  When people break the rules there might be quarantine for two weeks.  If they break the rules they should have to stop.  However, we should have an evidence-based approach for some of them and sample what is going on.  There has been a knee-jerk reaction of closing all pubs.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that to go for a zero-Covid strategy, we need an effective vaccine in place now.  Otherwise, we would need to follow the New Zealand approach to the letter of the law, which means locking down, having 14 days' quarantine, driving it out and not letting any people in.  There are no fudge factors.  The alternative is to look to countries like Sweden and Denmark, which are taking a much more sensible approach right now.  Denmark is not mandating masks but is doing randomised controlled trials of masks, which are due to be published soon.  Following this approach results in a very intelligent mitigation strategy.<\/p><p> I would look to the evidence of where we think significant transmission will happen before we have a vaccine.  There is some preliminary evidence about that.  I cannot go in to all of it now but I refer to things like mass events beyond the 1,500 people allowed, particularly indoors.  We look for the areas where we can make a difference versus the knee-jerk reaction, which is what we have seen in the UK.  A very good example of that would be, for instance, the recent lockdown in Leicester.  I believe one of the Deputy's colleagues alluded to that.  To be clear about what is happening, at the height of the pandemic, Leicester, which has a population of approximately 340,000, had 45 admissions.  Since the city locked down in July, there have been seven admissions.  While the number of detected cases was going up, and we must remember that is not the same as cases, the city had seven admissions in the whole of July, and we are working on this.  What is happening with the disease, therefore, is not the same as what is happening when we detect cases.  That strategy is to have a test and trace system and manage the cases.<\/p><p> When we think about lockdown, it is important that we think about the impact of Covid-19 on morbidity and mortality and not its impact on cases.  At the moment, the number of detected cases is going up.  That is not the same as cases but in terms of the impact of the disease, admissions, critical care units and deaths are at a historic low level.  I would watch that information to drive the policy of the Deputy's country as opposed to detected cases, which are increasing.<\/p><p> I will tell the Deputy the reason the number of detected cases is going up, and this is my last point.  The UK is picking up about 100 cases per 1,000 people.  On a daily basis, therefore, we are getting about 1,000 people a day but the Office for National Statistics, ONS, survey data tell us that in terms of the background rates in the UK, between 2,000 and 8,000 people actually have the disease right now.  Wherever more testing is done, one will pick out what is in the background.  What one should not do is use that to get stressed and anxious and come up with a knee-jerk policy.  It should be done to reflect on what is working and what is not working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#PPPP00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Carl Heneghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Heneghan for that response.

That may prove to be incorrect, but it is the IMF's current forecast.  Therefore, the painting of New Zealand as returning to complete normality may not be correct.  For example, indicators right up to July pointed to further declines in consumer confidence in New Zealand.  Although New Zealand's approach may turn out to be correct, we cannot be certain in any way that that will be the case.  My hunch is that it will not.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's specific comments and questions, my hunch is that we need to follow a risk-based approach.  People need to be advised by medics on how risky something is for them.  Any of the medics present can correct me if I am wrong, but the risk of younger people of dying from this virus is tiny.  In Ireland, not a single child or baby has died.  No one under 15 years of age has died.  I checked this with the CSO on Monday - eight people under 65 years of age and with no health issues have died.  The majority of the population is under 65 years of age and has no health issues.  We need to assess individually how great a risk we face from this virus and adapt our personal behaviours on the basis of that risk.<\/p> <p>  If we look back over the past 100 years, what had the greatest impact on human welfare holistically?  Was it the Spanish flu, from which tens of millions of people died, or was it the Great Depression, which led to social and political upheaval and eventually war?  I can say, as an economist, that we are on track for a Great Depression-type event.  I have no idea how things will turn out, but we know what happened in the 20th century.  Look at the history books.

It is important that everyone understand what the risks are by age and certain conditions.  Unlike the flu, there is a stark difference in the risk for young people.  For example, the risk for under 50s in England is minimal.  It is slightly higher for over 50s because there seem to be some issues about ethnicity, but there are also higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and, in particular, obesity.  That is one strategy which should be pursued.<\/p><p>The main threat now of Covid is the emerging threat of focusing unified on this single problem of Covid.  There are many people who do not have experience in healthcare who have overnight become experts in respiratory pathogens in this outbreak.  It has been astounding where they have all come from.  They tend not to use an evidence-based approach but cherry-pick evidence to suit the argument.  In the UK right now, we are looking at 200 excess non-Covid deaths.  The current messaging means that 50% of people with a worsening health condition are not coming forward for healthcare and presenting as an emergency and that is leading to substantial problems with strokes and cardiovascular disease.  For the past seven weeks in a row, we have had approaching 700 excess deaths in private homes that are not related to Covid whereas we have drastically reduced the excess deaths in care homes and hospitals.  Overall, we are tending under, but we have got this huge burgeon now appearing that the public does not get where its risk is.  If one examines the risk and looks at one's strategy and one takes an evidence-based approach to when one does things and what the evidence allows one to understand, one might get a more measured approach going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300002#RRRR00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Carl Heneghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273200,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I appreciate Professor Heneghan has to leave us in five minutes but I will go to Professors Kearney and Staines.

There is only one issue remaining.  As we evolved through this, I remember sitting on the committee and hearing from a few members of National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  NPHET is our equivalent of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE.  It was asked about face masks and the committee was told there was no evidence that face masks were beneficial.<\/p><p>At that time, the World Health Organization, WHO, had not recommended wearing face masks.

In 2010, at the height of the last pandemic, there were six published trials of about 4,000 people.  Since then, we have not addressed the lack of evidence and closed that graph.  In the intervening ten years, there have been about another six trials.  If one looks at the 12 trials together, what they show in healthcare professionals is that masks, gloves and a combination of PPE reduces the risk of infection.<\/p> <p>  When one goes into the wider population, there is a small bit of evidence that shows that if one has influenza in one&rsquo;s household - a child, for example - and if one wears a mask for one week in the house, one can reduce one&rsquo;s risk of influenza or likely illness by about 10%.  However, one has to completely adhere to mask wearing for the whole week.  If one stops adhering to it, as 50% of people did, one loses all the effect.  That is one of the problems.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that the evidence comparing cloth masks to surgical masks or the N95s shows clearly that cloth masks are worse and may actually increase the risk of infection.  Therefore, that is why they are not recommended in hospitals or in health professional settings.<\/p> <p>  What happens in these situations of uncertainty is that the opinion divides.  Someone thinks mask are a good idea while someone else does not think they are and that people should not wear them.  That is why we end up with people proposing them more and more.  They say people should put them on in schools, pubs and shops.  However, there is no clear evidence.  They use observational data to inform their decision.  If one looks at what has happened in the UK, for instance, it put masks in on 24 July.  They were supposed to reduce the risk of infection by 40% over the next two weeks.  In fact, infections detected have gone up.  In effect, people are not looking at the evidence.<\/p> <p>  When Norway looked at this, it said that at low circulation, the public health consequences were so minimal that it was not clear they worked and, even if they did work, it reckoned about 200,000 people would have to wear a mask fully for a week to prevent one infection.  That is how one has to think about the uncertainty.  If one is going to put a policy in place, that is fine.  What one cannot do, however, is say it is evidence-based because when people talk about the evidence, they have again cherry-picked low-quality, observational evidence to suit the argument.  However, they have not picked further observational evidence.

The view in most of the public health community - the evidence as reviewed by Professor Heneghan's colleague supports the view - is that this is a worthwhile effort.  It has a modest effect on the risk of a person spreading the virus to other people.  That is desirable.  Again, it is part of a spectrum of imperfect measures.
