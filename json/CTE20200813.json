We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee this morning.<\/p>  <p>  On previous occasions, both through written submissions and oral evidence, ICTU has outlined to members details of our active and significant role in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak in Ireland on behalf of workers.  In June, this committee sought and received our submission relating to the emergence of clusters of Covid-19 in the meat processing sector.  It is, therefore, not my intention to repeat the points raised therein.<\/p> <p>Meat processing plants, in our view, are very vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19 and should be regarded as high-risk workplaces in terms of viral spread.  There are specific features which underpin this classification that are recognised globally.  Meat processing is labour intensive, involving very physically demanding work, organised around at-pace production lines where workers work in close proximity to one another, making social distancing difficult to achieve, while language differences can often impede good communications.  Despite the fact that this is a highly profitable, heavily subsidised industry, low pay and deficient terms and conditions, including the absence of sick pay schemes, are common across the sector.  Workers may often live in crowded or congregated accommodation settings while transportation to and from work may not always be conducive to practising the required social distancing measures.<\/p> <p> From a very early stage, our affiliate trade union, SIPTU, has continuously highlighted the vulnerability of the meat processing sector to the spread of Covid 19.  I have no doubt its representatives will elaborate on this.  We have also regularly liaised with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, on these matters.<\/p> <p> For our part, congress has, through the consultative forum of the national safety protocol, sought to have a number of key principles adopted, which would serve to contain the spread of the virus and address the recent spikes in cases in meat processing plants in the midlands.  A special meeting of the forum was convened last Friday, 7 August 2020, to discuss the crisis in the sector.  It was attended by the acting chief medical officer.  At that meeting, congress called for the introduction of regular testing of all workers in the meat processing sector and the reassessment of the use of PPE in these plants.  It called on the Health and Safety Authority to conduct random and unannounced inspections of all meat processing facilities, with instruction for closure where appropriate, bearing in mind its extensive powers of enforcement.  In addition, where workers have tested positive and are on sick leave, self-isolating or in circumstances of temporary lay-off, congress stated they should be paid.  We note that following this meeting, the Government announced that the pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 covering sick pay, isolation period and lay-off time will be made available to migrant workers and those living in direct provision settings.<\/p> <p> Congress has petitioned both the Health and Safety Authority and the Government to classify this disease as an occupational injury which would provide statutory protection to workers in the face of Covid-19, but to no avail.  The effect of its exclusion from the scope of current regulations is that the employer is not obliged to notify the Health and Safety Authority of incidents of employees having contracted the disease in the course of their employment.  Consequently, the HSA cannot undertake an investigation so as to establish how it may have occurred, nor can it advise or give instructions on the prevention of similar occurrences.  This is a major flaw in current regulations that should be rectified swiftly.  Congress is very dissatisfied that the HSA seems not to be supportive of this remedy but rather views Covid-19 as a public health matter and not a safety, health and welfare at work issue.  Congress, through its HSA board representation, has sought to have this very serious matter progressed but all such efforts have been rejected through correspondence from the chairman of the HSA.<\/p> <p> In the face of this lethal virus the health and safety of our communities and workforce is paramount.  Therefore, no effort should be spared in ensuring that all the necessary measures are put in place to contain and eliminate this disease.  We hope the committee will recommend favourably on the matters we have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300003#B01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597273800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King very much.

Our 6,000 and more members in the meat processing industry have been extremely concerned about the potential for their exposure and, by extension, their families, to Covid-19, as they rightly believed that the industry was insufficiently prepared to deal with what was and is an unfolding public health and occupational health crisis of unprecedented nature and scale.  The justified concerns of our members were predicated on the experiences being suffered by fellow meat processing and abattoir workers in the United States, Canada and across Europe.  Our national network of shop stewards and health and safety representatives was in constant contact with our officials on the ground about concerns relating to the need for adequate provision of PPE, multilingual health and safety information, etc.<\/p>  <p>  SIPTU took on board those legitimate concerns and responded as follows.  On 20 March, we raised concerns with certain employers and public representatives about health and safety within the industry.<\/p> <p>On 3 April, we wrote to the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, noting that our members' health and safety was of paramount importance and the need for his Department to support both industries in advance of a Covid-related European Union special agricultural committee meeting taking place on 6 April.  On 10 April and 1 May, we publicly called for mandatory temperature testing to be put in place for workers in meat plants.  On 28 April, we issued a letter of complaint to the Health and Safety Authority requesting inspections at a particular meat plant.<\/p> <p> On 15 May, we again wrote to the then Minister, requesting that he bring together all elements of the meat processing industry to establish a \"farm to fork\" task force to deal with this unprecedented crisis.  We still believe that a sector-specific strategy is required and that workers' considerations must be part of any such strategy.  The Minister did not agree to such a farm to fork task force being constituted.<\/p> <p> On 18 May, we wrote to Meat Industry Ireland, MII, seeking a meeting to discuss the ongoing and most serious impact that Covid-19 was having on our members.  MII representatives refused to meet us.  On 20 May, we wrote to the HSA advising of our deep concern at its testimony, given on 19 May, which confirmed that meat plant inspections were only commencing.<\/p> <p> In June and July, we called for increased testing of workers and compliance with temperature testing and the updated HSE guidelines of 30 June.  On 16 July, we again wrote to MII, following its commitment given at a meeting of this committee to meet SIPTU representatives, and I am glad to report this meeting occurred on Monday this week.  At this meeting, both parties agreed to seek a meeting with the Health Service Executive national standing oversight committee to discuss the need for repeat blanket testing of workers within the industry, with an emphasis on speed of testing and results, and a protocol to deal with potential scenarios arising.  MII also agreed to bring a SIPTU charter on Covid to its members for consideration.  This charter addresses such issues as support for unannounced HSA inspections, compliance with HSE guidelines and temperature testing and the need for engagement on terms and conditions of employment, with particular reference to pay and sick pay provision.  A further meeting is scheduled with MII representatives for 1 September.<\/p> <p> It is now beyond doubt that the meat processing industry contains unrivalled vectors for the transmission of Covid-19, which had previously caused 1,115 meat plant workers to be infected in 20 clusters as of early July.  These vectors include close proximity working, bottlenecks in canteens and toilets, noise pollution causing workers to shout to communicate and which creates droplets circulated through the industrial air cooling systems and relatively low wages causing workers to car pool, share accommodation and in many cases share rooms within that accommodation.  It is notable that circa 90% of workers in the industry do not have sick pay, forcing vulnerable workers to go to work, even if they are feeling unwell with possible Covid-19 symptoms.<\/p> <p> In mid-June, we predicted that if a second wave of Covid-19 were to arise, it would manifest itself in the meat processing industry.  This article was published on 23 June and this opinion was predicated on the experiences of other countries, such as the United States and Canada, and the example in Germany, wherein two months after the country announced looser Covid-19 controls, an outbreak in a meat processing plant triggered a return to lockdown in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  This meat plant was closed after 1,500 workers tested positive for Covid-19.<\/p> <p> In the Republic of Ireland, we now have circa 1,450 meat plant workers with confirmed Covid-19 cases, with clusters of more than 100 cases in five separate meat plants following the recent resurgence in the midlands.  Other European Union countries long ago set up national outbreak control teams with the voice of meat processing workers being represented.  Why has Ireland not done likewise?  Surely it is the workers who would have greater knowledge of the position on the ground and it is the workers and their families who are vulnerable and most at risk.  Why did the HSA not commence inspections at meat plants until late in May and why do we still have very few unannounced inspections?  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, performs an excellent public duty through its unannounced inspections. Do we cherish the quality of our food more than the safety of our people?<\/p> <p> Hourly rates of basic pay across the industry generally range from minimum wage to &euro;12.50 per hour, with some skilled workers able to accrue an additional premium payment through piece-rates and bonuses.  Everyone recognises that meat processing is an essential service but this must be recognised with reasonable rates of pay to reflect the labour intensive and physically demanding roles in meat processing.<\/p> <p> As I stated, nine of every ten workers do not have access to a sick pay scheme.  This is a significant contributory factor in the spread of Covid-19 within the workplace.  Why have we not ensured that workers suffer no loss of earnings should they have to isolate?  The pandemic unemployment payment is not an appropriate substitute for the necessary legislative imposition of a sick pay scheme but it could be part of it in the short term where employers make up the net pay balance.<\/p> <p> In comparison with our EU peer group, SIPTU's economic research, which can be provided, demonstrates that Irish meat plant operatives work an average of 4.7 weeks per year more than their EU counterparts and rank bottom of the list on actual hourly wages received.  A feature of the continental system is the high level of employer social insurance, which ensures that most workers in our EU peer group receive acceptable illness benefit.<\/p> <p> In following the recent commentary about Covid-19 outbreaks in the meat industry, there would seem to be a much higher proportion of asymptomatic cases than in other areas.  I do not know how this is possible.  Very recent commentary has emerged of workers being redeployed from one meat plant to another to finish production at weekends, causing so much concern about contagion that regular employees refused to go back to work until their safety concerns were addressed.<\/p> <p>I have been reliably advised in recent days that upwards of 40 migrant meat plant workers are sharing rooms and accommodation in a certain town in Offaly.  Should this prove to be the case and if we are truly serious about defeating Covid transmission within the meat industry, this hot bedding of workers has to stop.  Surely this is not an Ireland that anyone would want to be proud of or indeed be associated with.<\/p> <p> Where large Covid outbreaks have been established and production lines shut down, we cannot have a situation, as we believe occurred recently, wherein other workers in that same employment were tested and went back to work to deal with perishable product, and four days later they found out that they had tested positive for Covid.  Where such large outbreaks occur, workers should be immediately removed from the workplace without loss of earnings until the workplace is deep cleaned, sanitised and inspected by the HSA, with workers only returning when they have tested negative for the virus.  We can no longer compromise workers' safety through the unbridled drive for profits.  We have already seen the tragic death of one meat plant worker from Covid-19 on the island of Ireland; we do not need to see another.  Meat may be perishable, but workers must not be so.<\/p> <p> The reimposed lockdown in counties Laois, Kildare and Offaly to deal with this crisis is now costing the midlands economy more than it would cost to ensure employers and State agencies are equipped to fulfil their obligations for a safe working environment.<\/p> <p> We need legislation to ban subcontracting and bogus self-employment within the meat industry, similar to that announced in Germany on 20 May.  So-called sole traders, working in Irish meat plants, paying tax in Poland, with employers avoiding PRSI contributions, workers missing out on leave and welfare benefits and the State being denuded of tax revenue must be stopped.  Licensed direct employment is the way forward in this regard and an end to agency working in this industry is now necessary.<\/p> <p> It is never too late to do the right thing and Tuesday's belated announcement by the Government for repeated weekly blanket testing of workers in meat plants, which we have been calling for for some time, within the lockdown areas is welcome, but we need to go further.  We need rapid result turnaround times for this testing within 24 hours, as is the case in the UK.  We also need a clear protocol as to how cases or suspected cases of Covid are isolated within the workplace and how co-workers within that work area or employment are treated.<\/p> <p> The emergence of Covid-19 within the Irish meat processing industry has been extremely difficult for our members.  They are all petrified of contracting the disease and they feel they must walk a tightrope every day.  In many cases, they attend work even if they are unwell.<\/p> <p> We have had many cheerleaders trumpeting the essential nature of meat processing at both Government and employer level.  It is now time for these entities to put their money where their mouths are and recognise the need for workers within the industry to have decent pay, sick pay and pension provision put on a statutory footing, similar to that of a sectoral employment order.  This will be the litmus test of those who are saying they are doing everything they can to eradicate Covid-19 in the Irish meat industry.<\/p> <p> As Covid will prevail for possibly years to come and meat will always remain an essential foodstuff for our population, we have little choice but to shine a light like never before on this industry and address once and for all the socio-economic issues which have given rise to the meat industry being the perfect storm for the transmission and predicted resurgence of Covid-19 in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Ennis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597275000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I note Mr. Ennis has called for a 24-hour turnaround period in testing.

On behalf of the Independent Workers Union, I thank the committee for inviting us to present our findings today.<\/p>  <p>  The Cork Operative Butchers Society branch of the Independent Workers Union has been supporting workers in meat plants and in the meat industry for a long time and has been in daily contact with workers of different nationalities employed in several meat plants around Munster for the duration of the pandemic thus far.  As the workforce in this industry is largely foreign, with limited English fluency, I emphasise that our union, even though it is small, has had privileged access to these workers&rsquo; experiences, as our team includes Polish and Romanian-speaking organisers, and the union constantly strives to provide translation for any other language which is necessary for organising this diverse workforce.

We are convinced that the reason Ireland has witnessed so many worrying outbreaks in meat plants in the past months is due to the workers&rsquo; substandard employment and living conditions which are the result of the industry&rsquo;s long-term disregard for the well-being of its staff. These problems are aggravated by the unscrupulous practices of the work placement agencies through which many of the workers in this sector are employed.  Based on our membership a high percentage, perhaps 40% or 50% - we do not know - of these workers are employed through agencies.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly list the main factors which led, in our opinion, to such a dire epidemiological situation in the meat-packing sector in Ireland.  I would like the committee to bear in mind that, in our view, these Covid-19 outbreaks are simply the most visible consequence of chronic issues that should be of great concern in their own right.  First, there is the question of overcrowded accommodation.  Many meat plants are in rural areas where there is a shortage of suitable accommodation to begin with.  As most meat workers are paid the minimum wage, often with no overtime premium, their tight budgets force them into seeking shared accommodation, sometimes even with several families in the same house.  At the same time, being foreign and with a limited command of English is a real disadvantage in independently securing accommodation.  Many workers we know are being housed by their employment agencies which, seeking to maximise profit from the accommodation they provide to their employees, crowd as many people as possible into each house they let.  This reckless behaviour on the agencies&rsquo; part also led to people being moved from one shared house to another during the height of the pandemic in an effort to keep each house full so as not to lose income.  Our union has documented several such cases.  The workers housed by the employment agencies never get a proper contract for their paid accommodation, even after several years of living in the same place, so they can be moved around or evicted without notice, both of which have happened since March to workers we know.  It is obvious that this dismal housing situation favours the spread of Covid-19 among workers and, despite relating to conditions outside of work, is a result of low pay and dependency on the employer for accommodation.<br\/><br\/>Second, most workers need to provide their own transportation to get to work.  As I said earlier, many meat plants are in quite remote areas and the employers make no effort to provide any transport.  There is no public transport available.  On a tight budget, the workers car pool and they fill the cars to capacity.  This has continued throughout the pandemic as most employers make no effort to facilitate the safe and socially distant transport option, either through a company bus or with financial assistance for private transportation, both of which would have been possible, while perfectly aware of how their staff get to work every day.<br\/><br\/>Third, many workers in this sector do not benefit from a sick-pay scheme with their employer and this is especially the case with all the agency workers we know.  This means that these workers, while already on very low pay, know that when they are ill they will not be able to earn any money at all.  Of course, this logically leads to some workers being less cautious than they should ideally be after noticing early symptoms of what might or might not be a worrying condition.  We also know that many workers, after years in Ireland, do not have a GP, which can be seen as an indirect consequence of extremely difficult working conditions.  When working on minimum wage, one has to work excessive hours, often more than 50 hours a week, to get by.  This limits the time available to find a doctor and the time to learn the basics of English to communicate with a medical professional.  One has to pay for the doctor and often also for the translator when visiting the doctor.  A special case of this lack of access to healthcare, but of great importance, is that of a great number of workers, all Romanian, who were for years cheated out of their social security rights in Ireland by the employment agency which was hiring them to work in several meat plants in Munster.  This agency employed all these Romanian nationals as self-employed contractors declared in Poland, so all the workers' contributions were sent to the Polish and not the Irish Revenue.  I emphasise it is our union that has uncovered hundreds of such cases and we have filed hundreds of complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission.  For many years, all of these workers have had no annual leave, no right to illness benefit, no rights to child allowance, had no PPS numbers, and were <i>de facto<\/i>invisible in Ireland.  While some of these workers were self-isolating on suspicion of Covid-19 in March, they had no access to a doctor, no GPs would take them and their agency tried to force them to apply for unemployment benefit instead of the Covid-19 illness benefit, taking advantage of the fact that the workers had no GPs and no English.  Our union is present in several plants where this agency operates in Munster and we have knowledge of other places in Ireland where the same practices are happening and where the same agency supplies workers.  When these workers have no legal existence in Ireland for years they are also not entitled to illness benefit and they are extremely vulnerable.  Based on these observations I will emphasise one last point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Labo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597275600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Labo to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300007#F00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597275600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I ask for just five seconds; my colleague spoke more.  These workers are not just vectors for a virus.  They are not just vectors for a disease.  They are people with full lives.  It is important to take into account all aspects of their lives when we think about how to prevent this disease.  For example, if Perspex screens are introduced and we do not take into consideration that the workers then must lift heavy crates above the Perspex screens, then their workload is greatly increased and, while the pace of their work has never slowed during the pandemic, such measures will not work.  The workers' well-being, their workload, their mental health, their income and social and economic conditions have to be taken into account if we want to contain this disease.<\/p> <p> As my colleagues said, we recommend unannounced inspections.

I will say two things.  When we previously gave evidence before the committee, we spoke mainly about the national Return to Work Safely Protocol and its provisions.  One of the key flaws in its implementation in meat factories relates to worker representation on the ground.  Putting in place worker representation infrastructure is a key part of the protocol to facilitate quality interaction between the management and the workforce in the various work settings.  That has not happened in meat factories.  Worker representation infrastructure is very low-grade, although the employers do not agree with me on that.  I have raised this matter on several occasions at the consultative forum on the implementation of the protocol and I have told the employers that I am very unhappy because the workforce representation has not been effective at all.  There are many reasons for that which we can go into in more detail, and I am sure others will do so.<\/p>  <p>  Second, it is untenable that the HSA, which is assigned in law the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of all aspects of the protocol, has the power to inspect workplaces and order closure where appropriate and is there to maintain the health and safety of workers and protect them in the workplace, is not even notified when a worker contracts Covid.  We have to get our heads around that.  I realise the import of what I am saying, but all the indicators are that the HSA does not want to be notified of such cases.  It does not want this task.  From day one, I have had this argument with Government representatives.  I am on record on this matter and am blue in the face writing about it.  Two weeks ago, I met the T&aacute;naiste and for the first time he said he would consider the points we were making about this issue.<\/p> <p>If we have a Health and Safety Authority, HSA, charged with the protection and the prevention of injury and so on to workers in workplaces and it is not even notified, does not do the inspections and does not go to the place to find out what happened and give advice on what should happen to prevent it happening again, we will arrive in all sorts of a mess.  It says it is a public health issue, which it is, and as the members know the public health people operate under legislation from 1981.  They go and do what they have to do to protect not just in the workplace but they are also very interested in the spread of this virus in terms of the community.  That is their job but there is no emphasis satisfactorily in that regard.  That has to be put right and we believe there is a swift way of doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300008#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597276500,"counter":46,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Durkan, in short, \"No\".  I am far from happy and I will give him the reasons with regard to Kildare that he mentioned.  We have a situation in meat plants in Kildare where lines are shut down, for example, and 50% of the workers have tested positive and are taken out of the workplace.  That is fine, but we have other workers in that meat plant dealing with a different product who are tested and then sent back in to deal with perishable product - product of value.  They then get the results four days later and they are told that they have Covid-19.  That is unforgivable.  That is a real issue that should never be repeated.<\/p>  <p>  The second point I would make is that we are too slow to get test results, and I believe that is still the case this week in Kildare.  The issue of the HSA inspections needs to be drilled in once and for all because we are not happy with the number of unannounced visits.  I believe there are very few, if any, and the HSA needs to be pressed on that.  Looking forward, however, in terms of trying to fix this, because we have to fix it, I suggest we need to bring in what I have termed Covid compliance officers with the sole responsibility for policing Covid-19 within the meat industry.  Those designated officers possibly should come from the HSA inspectorate and if it needs to be beefed up, we must beef it up - no pun intended.  We have to ensure we deal with this issue because what has happened in Kildare, and in other counties, for the past number of months is not acceptable.  We are too slow to get test results.  We need the HSA to be doing what it is paid to do.  We need Covid compliance officers.  At the end of the day, I am not at all satisfied with what has happened.  We cannot prioritise profits over the health and safety of our workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Ennis"},{"type":"speech","time":1597276500,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ennis.

There is no doubt that many of the terms and conditions of employment in the meat industry must be addressed, particularly the issue of bogus self-employment.  They are matters I have no doubt the trade union movement has been working on long before this issue arose and will continue to do so.  For the remit of this committee, the impact of the virus is our focus.  The learning point seems to be that where there is co-living and close working, with very few public transport options, there is an inevitability that that will lead to a cluster of Covid-19.  My question is for all the witnesses.  It appeared for a long time that meat industry plants would not be impacted in the same way they were elsewhere in Europe, particularly in June and July.  Have the representatives been given any information as to the reason this has happened now?

I commend the trade union representatives appearing before the committee on their efforts, not just in respect of this issue but on many others down the years.  Some may be aware that I used to be a branch secretary for a number of years in a workplace in the Unite trade union, so I support and have sympathy for and an awareness of the work the representatives do.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to put my questions in context.  Since I am a representative from the lockdown counties as they are now known, I will briefly recap what has happened in the past week in Kildare, Laois and Offaly and the impact it has had upon businesses.  Small businesses, which are employers in their own right, had just picked up the pieces and were beginning to get off the ground again in terms of trading, restoring consumer confidence as well as their own in their operations, bringing workers back into their workplaces and investing in PPE, screens and so on.<\/p> <p>Perishable stocks, which were bought in for what they hoped was the remaining part of the tourism season, are now written off and wiped out.  I refer to not only those businesses which have been forced to close but the businesses around them, such as fashion boutiques and retailers, which are seeing such a plummet in footfall.  That is the impact it has had on the business community.  In terms of destination shopping venues, such as Naas and Kildare Village, nobody is coming in from outside because they are not allowed to do so and there has been a huge knock-on effect on local businesses and the local economy.<br\/><br\/>In terms of people who feel they have done everything right - they have worn their masks, they have minded themselves, they have stayed indoors, they have social distanced and all the rest of it - any chance of a staycation has gone.  Any chance of family breaks are gone.  By and large, people have cancelled <i>en masse<\/i>.  Not only are there all the implications but they themselves cannot even get away.  That is psychologically damaging.  That is a huge blow to the county.  I suppose what really compounds it is the view that outbreaks are concentrated on the meat plants.  There are particular clusters but three counties are paying the price for three or four plants.<br\/><br\/>There is a number of boundary conditions, etc., which I do not have time to go into.  There are certain estates, for instance, Kilmalum in Blessington, where the back of the cul-de-sac is in Kildare and to get out of the estate in the morning, people have got to break the law because of the way the lockdown was done.  In any event, I want to move on to questions to the witnesses.<br\/><br\/>I read all the submissions this morning and thank the witnesses for the presentation today.  The State put in place a number of supports to help workers and help the wider economy and the wider society during the pandemic but it strikes me that these have not been applied, or that we have not been able to apply them, in the sector.  We heard about temporary accommodation and about accommodation issues.  Despite there being an eviction ban in place, we saw that workers were forced to move from one place to another and often cohabit.  We saw workers afraid to take sick leave and afraid to phone in sick despite there being the pandemic payment and temporary wage support schemes.  It strikes me, as a general rule, that many of the State supports were not available, whether through ignorance, lack of awareness or possibly lack of promotion within those workplaces, and all those issues must be examined.<br\/><br\/>I will home in on one issue because Ms Patricia King has mentioned this.  This is the notification of a workplace disease, the definition of personal injury and the idea that if somebody trips on a floorboard or injuries himself or herself on a piece of machinery in a factory, that is notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.  If somebody presents with coronavirus or another infectious disease, that is not.  What we have heard Ms King and others say today and in recent days is that the plethora of sanctions, inspections and powers that would kick in were that in that statutory instrument and were part of the Health and Safety Authority framework would be there and the power of the State could be brought to bear but because this disease is not listed as a notifiable illness, that does not happen.  I studied the regulations again this morning.  When I see the 2016 regulations - we have heard that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment could make a one-line change to those regulations to introduce infectious disease or coronavirus as a notifiable illness - it was there previously in the 2011 and 2007 regulations.  In the 2016 regulations, it was deliberately taken out.  Turning to page 3 of those regulations, I see that &quot;&quot;personal injury&quot; does not include any disease, occupational illness or any impairment of mental condition&quot;.  That is the real scandal here, not that it is not there at present which, of course, it should be, but that it was previously there and was removed.  I would ask for the witnesses' opinion on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300010#J03200","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597277700,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses, between them, to speak for no more than a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300011#K00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597277700,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy and thank him for the query.  The Deputy is correct.  This regulation 224, put in in 2016, excludes personal injury.  In the Act, accident is defined as personal injury and personal injury does include any infectious disease, but the regulation, in 2016, came along and excluded it.  My judgment is that the employers are hung up about the mental health issue there and they did not want to have this - what they believed to be onerous.  That is my own judgment of what was going on at that particular time.  However, this regulation was signed up to anyway.<\/p>  <p>  As to what can happen, section 58 of the Act allows the Minister to lay an amended regulation before the Houses of the Oireachtas, but it becomes valid from the time of its making unless and until it is amended by the Oireachtas.  We could resolve this problem quickly.  So far, the T&aacute;naiste stated he was looking at it.<\/p> <p>The HSA, in my judgment, has obstructed our efforts because it is now talking about it requiring a major risk impact assessment.

If the T&aacute;naiste is minded to make the requisite changes, I have legislation which I published in June which will ensure this is done.  I look forward to support for this from Members right across the House.  There is general agreement that if one contracts Covid in the workplace, it should be treated as a workplace injury.

The HSE would have carried out significant testing in a particular plant.  It would have been aware of a strong presence of Covid.

When one blows a whistle in a plant, there are many carcasses - I am sorry to be so graphic - lying about.  It is valuable product as far as the employers would see it.  Those workers were tested and even though they were in a workplace where there was a significant number of confirmed cases of Covid, they went back in without having first got the results of their tests.

Sometimes workers called me with a photo of the mask and asked me to tell them how to use it, could it be re-used or how long it was good for because no such instructions had been given by the employing agencies.  In terms of translation and everything else it has been dismal.  For some communities that have been in Ireland for longer, like the Polish community, perhaps the factories have some available translation or supervisors who are already from that background and speak the language.

This is a problem.  The Deputy asked how many cases are in the migrant category.  I watched the meeting of this committee that was addressed by Meat Industry Ireland and its representatives may appear again today.  I found it ironic that eastern European workers, although they have free movement across the EU, are not recognised by Meat Industry Ireland as migrant workers.  That is spin.

As such, there will be, <i>pro rata<\/i>, more cases among workers because of vectors such as cramped living conditions and the car-pooling that workers are forced into using.

Many people did not have GPs as they did not have a PPS number.  This was because they had been scammed by their employment agency.  These workers were in a very difficult situation and the agencies and the hirers, by which I mean the factory owners, did not help their staff in any way.

We put in preventative and corrective measures within the charter.<\/p>  <p>  I believe we absolutely need to look at the meat processing industry from every angle.  As I outlined previously, we need all of the stakeholders to be involved but we definitely need to look at the terms and conditions of workers within that industry.  It is not good enough to cheerlead, call it an essential service and pay people a pittance for very labour-intensive and sometimes very challenging work in meat plants.<\/p>  <p>  This has shone a light on the meat industry.  When a crack opens up the light comes in and this has been the crack in the meat industry.  It is about time that this industry was put under the microscope.  There is nothing wrong with an employer making profits once they are generated through workers that are on reasonable terms and conditions.  That is the trade-off and at the moment that is not happening.  I would welcome a task force and I would love if this committee recommended it.

I thank Deputy Cairns for the question.  There are a number of reasons for it.  First, affiliate unions of Congress, but in particular SIPTU, have represented workers in meat plants for decades.  In some cases there is a collective agreement on terms and conditions but that is not the norm and it is not by any means in the majority of cases.<\/p> <p> I sit on the Low Pay Commission and I have taken part in public consultations where we have had exposure to workers coming in from the street to offer their view on what happens in their environment in meat factories as well.  We are well aware of the issues.  There is a very large body of opposition to workers having any voice in the industry and there is a reason for that.  With a production pace at this level, it is the focus of the employers.  We can look at the top ten companies operating in the sector.  The top company had a turnover of &euro;2.3 billion in 2019 and the second company had a turnover of &euro;2.2 billion.  There is big money to be made and their focus is on keeping the production lines as fast and as lean as possible.  The model is to work people as hard as they can for as little as they can for as long as they can.  It is the model and the companies will resist any infiltration by us in trying to have discussions.<\/p> <p> These companies are helped by a lack of legislation in this country.  This means if those workers want to have their voice heard collectively, there is no law to help them in doing that.  The balance of power is with the employers and it is not a question that we have not said this.  We are blue in the face from saying it.  I have been doing this for a living for three decades and I can tell the committee that although we are blue in the face from making this argument, we still have not succeeded in getting across the value of having a balance in the employer-worker relationship.

It is important to note where are the profits.  There is no doubt there is a small number of players in the market and they are very much in control of that market.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, on television yesterday speaking about the poor price being paid to farmers for their produce, with farmers having to operate below cost.  The business operates a cost model.  Has SIPTU considered going to the Government to speak about the below-cost selling of meat, which is ultimately a big component of this problem?  I worked in the meat industry 30 years ago and at that time we sold meat at a higher price per kilogramme than we are selling it today.  The below-cost selling and loss leading of meat, particularly in the convenience sector, is a large proportion of the Irish price.  The witnesses know 90% of our meat exports are sold to the European market and we are subject to the pricing conventions within that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300019#S00600","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597282200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.

In many cases, and particularly in the white meat industry, these people are getting &euro;10.10 per hour, with no sick pay or pension provision and basic leave entitlement.  It is the same with the red meat and pork segments.  There are different areas with differing pay rates relating to skill sets and so on but in the main we are seeing workers getting &euro;12 or &euro;13 per hour, including the piece rate.<\/p> <p>It is immeasurable.  We have had a recent situation with SEOs.  I believe the Government may be appealing that High Court judgment and I wish it well with it.

As part of this process we need to bring in all the participants in the meat industry, not just the processors - the farmers, workers and consumers - to bring about a solution that will work for everyone.

The meat factories themselves are not in a position to recruit on that basis which is why they look to agencies.  Ms Labo has highlighted that agencies are not passing on the overtime.

Legislation arising from a European directive in 2012 was introduced to deal with temporary agency workers.  It provides that agency workers should not be treated any less favourably than their counterparts who are directly employed.  However, this is being bypassed by some employers by constructing this self-employed company they are putting in place.  They are constructing a way around this.  In aviation it is done in a very sophisticated way.  In this case I gather it is not that sophisticated.  The home employer is in Poland and not in Ireland at all.

Unless we get to a place where workers are not regarded as self-employed until they put forward the evidence as being non-bogusly self-employed, we will not deal with this.  We have hawked ourselves around the place to anybody who would listen to this to take on this argument.  I had a conversation with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.

I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive presentations, which contained a lot of information.<\/p> <p>The treatment of workers in our meat factories is totally unacceptable and a disgrace, but is hardly surprising when we think of how our farmers have been treated for decades.  The meat price is still not what it should be.  It should be at least &euro;4.20 per kilogram but farmers are not getting the colour of that, although there has been a slight improvement when compared with last year.  This time last year, we had chaos with suckler and beef farmers on their knees outside factory gates pleading with factories to give them a fair price for their produce.  Now we see the problem of meat factory workers coming to light.  While this problem has been around for decades, it is only being exposed now.<\/p> <p>  I have argued strongly that we need to see the meat factories reined in.  For some reason, a blind eye has been turned for too long with regard to meat producers and the workers in meat plants.  We need an overhaul and we need it fast.  As a Member of the Rural Independent Group, I call on the Government to take action once and for all because this cannot continue.  It is ruining livelihoods, communities and regions.  I come from the Laois-Offaly constituency.  We have been unfairly punished because of meat factories.  Some businesses are closing as they cannot continue any longer because of the actions of the meat factories.  This has to stop.  The midlands region is already on its knees, with Bord na M&oacute;na workers losing their jobs and more of them set to lose their jobs before Christmas.  We cannot allow this to continue.<\/p> <p> On 20 May, there were 828 cases of Covid-19 in meat factories.  Nearly three months on, the position is no better.  I want to know what exactly is happening.  The witnesses outlined some of the issues.  The committee was told previously about a national outbreak control team which would deal with the problem in the meat factories.  I think I know the answer to my next question, which is rhetorical in a sense.  What evidence is there of any work being carried out by this national outbreak control team?  It sounds great but has it done anything?<\/p> <p> Mr. Ennis outlined that testing turnaround times are a serious issue and I agree with him.  The Government has said it wants weekly testing done for four weeks.  Four weeks is not long enough given that we had a serious problem in May and we are still experiencing a problem.  For how long should the testing continue?  I believe that four weeks is not long enough.<\/p> <p> I will address a question on complaints received to SIPTU in particular.  Does SIPTU know how many complaints it has received from workers about conditions in the meat factories?  Has it received more complaints since 20 May when we had 828 cases?  I would like to know exactly what the figures are and would appreciate some information on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300020#T00700","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597283100,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Testing is a very important issue and SIPTU welcomed the Government's announcement that testing would take place for four weeks.  Deputy Nolan asked for how long testing should continue.  It will have to continue for as long as it is needed.  We could, rightly, blanket test workers in the HSE, nursing homes and residential care.  For five months, we have been raising the fact that there are perfect vectors in meat plants for the transmission of Covid-19.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, we need testing every week on a repeated basis until we get on top of this virus.  This is what we need.  More important, we need the results the following day as happens in the UK currently.  One could test 600 or 700 meat plant workers in one evening in the UK and get the result the following day.  This is what we need.  It is the only chance we have of keeping our workers safe, keeping the communities in Deputy Nolan's constituency safe, which is very important, and maintaining the continuity of meat production.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Nolan also asked about complaints.  As a union official, I have dealt with many high-level disputes over the past 23 years in different sectors, including transport.  I do not believe I have ever seen the volume of calls or complaints, call them what one will, that our officials on the ground have received from members since late April and early May.  I cannot say they go back to March.<\/p> <p>It is about our members and their families.  The Deputy referred to there being over 800 Covid cases in meat factories.  I mentioned the 1,115 cases by early July and now there are 1,450 and that figure is heading north.  When those workers have to isolate with suspected or confirmed Covid, their families also have to isolate due to being in close contact with them.  Two partners in a house could both be out of work and looking to get illness benefit or the pandemic unemployment payment.  This is a catastrophe for the economy in the region from which Deputy Nolan comes.  Those three counties are paying a heavy price for us taking our eye off the ball.  We need inspections and testing.  To answer the Deputy's other question, we have received hundreds of complaints from workers about their concerns.<\/p> <p> Finally, I have never seen an industry in my experience across the public and private sector where workers are so reluctant to come out front and talk to the media or union officials about their concerns for fear of retribution.

For instance, all these people who are falsely declared in Poland are completely invisible in Ireland.  They do not appear as being insured and having PPS numbers.  We uncovered hundreds of cases in several plants that are unionised with us but hundreds, even thousands, more such people might still be working in these conditions in other plants.  That can only be found out through inspections by, say, the scope section in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is supposed to assess if people are employees or self-employed, Revenue and so on.  A union can have no numbers beyond what its actual members experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300023#W00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Labo"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597284000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>If I may assist the Deputy on that, I believe the number of agencies is somewhere in the region of seven or eight.

I welcome all of them back before the committee.  I had an opportunity to question them in early July when the number of cases was decreasing.  That number decreased significantly afterwards as well..  My first question is on the significantly high number of cases, particularly in meat plants but also in direct provision centres, in what my colleague, Deputy Lawless, referred to as the lockdown counties versus other parts of the country.  I would like to hear from the witnesses as to why they believe there is a disparity between Kildare, Laois and Offaly versus the west of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Also, I asked in June about multilingual signage and training.  Has that improved in light of everything we now know about Covid-19 and the threat it causes to migrant workers, low-paid workers or indeed workers in meat plants?<\/p>  <p>  My next question relates to unannounced inspections, an issue I also raised previously.  One of the witnesses may have mentioned earlier that there were some unannounced inspections but not many.  Can they provide an indication of how many we are talking about because if they are not taking place that is a huge issue in itself?  Hopefully, that will be addressed shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, on foot of the witnesses' opening statements, there was a discussion on hot-bedding, which is shift workers sharing bedding or, indeed, housing.  How prevalent is that practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300023#W01100","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597284000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>If I can deal with the four questions, first - and without putting words in the Deputy's mouth - what is the reason for the numbers in the three lockdown counties and why are they not happening anywhere else?  The numbers are stark.  In total, we are looking at just under 300 cases across four employments in the three counties to which the Deputy refers.  It is not dissimilar to what happened in other plants in other areas that are not locked down where 25% of the workforce had confirmed cases of Covid-19 in some instances.  That happened in Cork, Tipperary and other places so we have had five clusters in meat plants with outbreaks of more than 100 confirmed cases.  I do not know why it is happening there.<\/p> <p>The reason for this has as much to do with what is happening outside of the workplace as with what is happening in it.  Some employers have worked well with us.  Unfortunately, many workers share accommodation and rooms, which has to do with the Deputy's question on hot bedding, and are being forced to carpool because they are paid a pittance.<\/p> <p> The Deputy's next question was on multilingual signage.  It has improved according to our information, albeit not to the extent where I would be satisfied.  The Deputy might say that I would say that anyway.  To be realistic, though, if there are seven or eight different languages in an employment, it would not cost too much to get signs transposed into those mother tongues.  The situation is not ideal.  It has improved, but not to the extent required.<\/p> <p> The unannounced inspections I have heard of in the past six weeks number in the single digits.  There are many more announced inspections.  As far as I am concerned, there should be no further announced inspections.  Everything should be unannounced.<\/p> <p> I used the term \"hot bedding\" in my opening remarks.  It is a common practice.  Earlier this year, we saw fruit pickers being flown in from Romania at the height of the pandemic.  Hot bedding is an issue in that sector.  I am not saying that it is rampant in the meat industry, but it definitely happens in a number of large towns, particularly one or two towns in the three lockdown counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300023#W01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Ennis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597284600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ennis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300024#X00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1597284600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Carthy, who has eight minutes.

We have seen the devastating impact on employees, businesses, families and communities in the three counties that have now gone back into lockdown.  It is no doubt seriously impacting their mental health as well.  We are potentially going to see rolling lockdowns in different counties or areas if the Covid disease is not kept under control or there are other outbreaks.  What is happening in the three counties should be a concern of everybody across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Employers are not under a duty to notify the HSA, Health and Safety Authority, of a disease or infection that has been contracted in a place of employment.  Accordingly, the HSA cannot carry out an investigation, advise or give instruction on prevention.  This was there in the pre-2016 regulations, however.  This is totally unacceptable for workers and communities at any time but especially in the current situation.  It also seems to be a destructive attitude if the employers are seeking to keep this position going.<\/p>  <p>  It is a function of the HSA to promote the prevention of personal injury.  As Ms Patricia King quite rightly pointed out, personal injuries under the Health and Safety Act 2005 include disease, any occupational illness or any impairment, physical or mental.  Sometimes employers seem to think these regulations are gospel and they can rely on them.  They are made under the Act, however.  The Act is primary and every employer has a duty of care to his or her employees under common law as well.<\/p>  <p>  Employers need to start wising up to that and realising that they have a duty of care to their employees.  They need to ensure their employees are protected.  As English is not the first language of many of these employees and they may not have been brought up with the Irish legal system, they may not be aware that when these regulations are wafted around in front of them that it is not gospel or the be-all and end-all of an employer's duties.<\/p>  <p>  From reading the legislation and previous regulations, I can see how this duty could be easily put back with the HSA by bringing in regulations as opposed to the necessity for further legislation.  It certainly needs to be amended to make it a duty for employers to report any disease or infections in a place of work.  Is it the understanding of the trade union representatives that a simple amendment to regulations, to effectively put this duty back on the HSA, would suffice?  If the authority needs additional resources, then so be it and they should be given to it.<\/p>  <p>  Meat plants in this country are dominated by a small number of players.

I am the deputy director of veterinary services in the Department of Agriculture and the Marine and I am joined by my colleague, Ms Maria Dunne, who is the head of one of our policy division dealing with the meat and dairy sector.  I have a very brief opening statement after which I will assist the committee in whatever way I can.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, as everyone is aware, categorised farming and food production as essential services under the Covid-19 regulations.  Irish food supply chains have continued to operate effectively to ensure continuity and security of supply of safe, healthy Irish food for consumers at home and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  A total of 149 meat premises are approved by the Department, with specific approvals for activities, including slaughtering, deboning, cold storage, etc., in the different  sectors of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry and so on.  Of these, 149 plants, the Department has a so-called permanent presence in 49 premises where slaughter of animals takes place.  In the other 100 or so premises, the Department does not have a permanent presence, but carries out risk-based inspections and controls as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  The Department's statutory responsibility in the context of meat plants is to ensure that Department-approved meat plants operate in compliance with the EU food hygiene legislation, animal health legislation and with animal welfare standards.  Approximately 250 veterinary and technical staff from the Department are routinely involved in supervising, regulating and controlling standards at these 149 meat premises.  I should say that this presence is supplemented by contractors and private veterinary practitioners who also provide a meat inspection service within those meat plants, in addition to the Department's permanent staff. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the pandemic, as the committee will be aware, primary responsibility for public health policy and implementation rests with the Department of Health, the HSE and general statutory responsibility for health and safety in the workplace rests with the Health and Safety Authority under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the whole-of-Government response to the pandemic, in addition to our statutory role in food safety, animal welfare and animal health, the Department has and will continue to provide any support required to the HSE and the HSA at local and national levels.  So far some of that support provided by our Department has included participation in and contribution to the HSE-chaired National Outbreak Control Team.  This National Outbreak Control Team, NOCT, as the committee will be aware, was set up to deal with Covid-19 outbreaks in meat plants in Ireland.  It is chaired by the HSE and was established in May.<\/p> <p>It issued detailed guidance to meat plants on 15 May, including about infection prevention and control measures.  An updated version of this guidance document was issued on 30 June.  This was the first such guidance document that was issued by any country in the EU.  It is an excellent document, and we can talk about that later if necessary.  We disseminated this document to all Department-approved plants on behalf of the HSE on 15 May.  We have since supported the HSE and the HSA in monitoring the effective implementation of all relevant guidance in our Department-approved plants.  This includes the document I have just referred to, the national outbreak control team guidance, as well as the return to work safely protocol.<\/p> <p> The support of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the work of the HSA was formalised through a memorandum of understanding agreed between the Department and the authority.  We commenced inspections on behalf of the HSA in the week commencing 20 July in meat plants and other food premises, including dairy plants and other plants in respect of which we have a role.  To date, we have completed 91 such inspections and these inspections are ongoing.  To be clear, these inspections are in plants in addition to the 49 places in which we have a permanent presence.  We expect to have completed the majority of our inspections by the end of next week, Friday, 21 August.  To date, our inspections have shown a high level of compliance.<\/p> <p> Since the start of the pandemic, regular meetings have taken place with meat industry representatives, at which it has been emphasised that their priority must be safeguarding human health and following HSE guidance at all levels of operation.  The first of these meetings took place on 11 March and they have continued weekly and fortnightly since then.  Looking back at the period since 11 March, I would say that there has not been a day-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300028#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Sheahan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597286700,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I have to ask Mr. Sheahan to conclude and we will move on to the next speaker.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to come before it today to discuss the current situation in meat processing plants.  The HSA operates under the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and associated regulations.  It is the national body with responsibility to ensure occupational safety, health and welfare for all persons at work.<\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Return to Work Safely Protocol in early May and the commencement of phase 1 of the roadmap, the authority has conducted 3,820 different inspections and investigations, 2,844 of which addressed Covid measures as set out in the protocol, across all different workplaces and sectors including meat processing plants.  While the authority is overseeing the checks of compliance with the protocol, given the nature of Covid-19, a cross-body inspection and compliance check approach was agreed by the Government.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is co-ordinating the provision of these additional inspection and monitoring mechanisms, which involve more than 500 resources from across the range of statutory bodies.  This is in addition to the authority's existing field inspectors who have been assigned on foot of the protocol.  We have provided the national help file for queries and complaints through our workplace contact unit and, since March, it has dealt with more than 8,000 contacts, with 66% relating to Covid.  These included 21 complaints about meat and food processing plants involving 12 specific employers and 15 requests for information.<\/p>  <p>  In early May, the authority became a member of the national outbreak control team that was established to review matters relating to meat processing plants at that time.  Our role there was entirely in the context of occupational health and safety.  Those meat plants were identified by the national outbreak control team and each inspection by the authority involved a full occupational health and safety inspection and a check of compliance with the interim guidance issued by the national outbreak control team as well as the protocol.  The inspection took place across all parts of the plant.  In the main, authority inspections were and are unannounced.  In certain circumstances, however, limited advance notification may be required for operational reasons.  A limited number of inspections may require the co-ordination of resources from a range of State agencies and Departments, which may lead to the employer being notified shortly before the inspection is due to take place.<\/p> <p>Inspection visits to MPPs with known outbreaks were pre-advised at short notice to ensure that relevant management and other key personnel were available to meet with us.<\/p> <p> Further to our involvement in the NOCT, we originally undertook 33 inspections.  The figure of 34 is in our submission and now we can say there have been 39 inspections.  These inspections included each of those plants connected with an outbreak, along with other plants not associated with any outbreaks.  The inspections involved engagement with all the on-site personnel from management right down to safety representatives and Department of Agriculture and the Marine officials.  Based on the inspections the authority identified a generally high level of compliance with the recommended measures to limit the spread of Covid in a workplace context as set out by the NOCT.<\/p> <p> The authority attended a meeting arranged by Department of the Taoiseach about the current outbreaks last week.  We have also been invited to and are engaged in a number of the current local outbreak control teams, OCTs, dealing with specific outbreaks in a number of the plants involved.  A national committee on cases and outbreaks of Covid-19 in high risk settings has been convened under the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and we have attended three meetings of that committee so far.<\/p> <p> We recognise the unique challenges posed by Covid-19 and acknowledge the shared responsibility between workers, employers and all of us to limit the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.  It is important to note that an outbreak in a particular setting does not necessarily reflect a poor system of control on behalf of the employer.  Our general experience to date indicates high levels of compliance across sectors and we have found employers, in the main, to be willing to engage and co-operate.<\/p> <p> The Health and Safety Authority wants to see all businesses in Ireland reopening as safely and successfully as possible while keeping workers safe too.  We remain committed to working with everyone to support and advise on how to be compliant with the protocol, the interim guidance from the NOCT, and all occupational health and safety measures and we will take appropriate enforcement action as and when needed.<\/p> <p> I again express my thanks for the invitation to speak to the committee today and along with my colleague, I am willing to answer any questions or queries members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300029#JJ00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597287300,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McGuinness.

I am accompanied today by Mr. Cormac Healy and Mr. Joe Ryan.<\/p>  <p>  When we last engaged with the committee, there had been some 22 clusters at primary processing plants.  As we have seen this week, a single primary processing site is unfortunately experiencing its first Covid-19 outbreak.  The original 22 clusters are no longer active clusters and 99% of affected staff have, thankfully, recovered and returned to work.  In the two-month period until 4 August, across all our members&rsquo; sites, just five additional cases had emerged.  Disappointingly, that situation altered last week.  However, it is important to reiterate that the majority of primary processing sites have had zero or very low numbers of positives.<\/p>  <p>  In the period since early June we have seen the strong impact of stringent controls and mitigation measures that were put in place early in the pandemic and were strengthened on 15 May with the publication of HSE protocols.  The rigid enforcement of these measures, verified by Government agencies through announced and unannounced audits, has served to reverse the trend of positive cases and restored the overall sector to relative stability.<\/p>  <p>  The meat sector was designated by Government as an essential service because it performed services that were deemed necessary for society.  As such, the sector continued to operate while most other non-essential manufacturing sectors were closed.  As a labour-intensive industry, where large groups of workers congregate, the workplace environment was transformed fundamentally to meet complementary objectives: keeping people safe while maintaining business continuity.  We introduced a rapid response in rolling out a comprehensive set of protocols across all sites that, over time and with the benefit of expert advice, enabled us reach the position of stability that has prevailed in recent months in all sites.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, Covid-19 travels through communities into industrial settings.  As occupational settings are locations where large numbers of people congregate, they provide the potential for the virus to spread, reflecting the dynamic between community and workplace.  As the pandemic accelerated across society, the HSE identified that many of the positive cases that emerged in meat plants were asymptomatic and were detected as part of wider HSE screening tests.<\/p> <p>This process identified clusters where the vast majority of the positive cases were asymptomatic, a finding which reinforced the insidious and indiscriminate nature of the virus and the challenges associated with identifying potential cases.  <\/p> <p> In this latest outbreak, there has been a rush to blame and to complain that nothing has been done to mitigate and prevent the virus spread in this industrial setting.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Kildare Chilling survived the high points of late April and early May, recording no virus cases when other clusters formed.  No simple conclusion can therefore be drawn from what has now emerged.  <\/p> <p> As we now move toward a new approach to Covid-19 testing, we remain fully committed to public health guidelines, including the additional screening proposals that Government announced in recent days.  However, these can only work to keep people safe while maintaining business continuity if the following steps are put in place: clear and unambiguous advance communication of the screening test protocols to ensure that everyone involved understands the procedures and follow up actions; a speedy and efficient sampling system, with test results returned within 24 hours of the sample being taken; and an effective track and trace system into which MII member companies will continue to record and transmit appropriate information to facilitate contact tracing by the HSE.  <\/p> <p> In conclusion, I assure the committee that our industry has worked diligently to protect employees throughout the course of this pandemic and continues to do so.  It took very extensive measures early in the crisis to protect workers and to ensure business continuity.  It continues to update and enhance its protocols in line with all relevant public health guidance.  Vigilance remains the priority.  Our members are proud of their committed workforce and we commend them and all those in the extended supply chain on their efforts during these very difficult times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300030#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597287900,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank members for the invitation to appear before the committee today.  I am the director of Food Drink Ireland and I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Linda Stuart-Trainor, who is our director of prepared consumer foods.<\/p>  <p>  Food Drink Ireland is part of IBEC and represents 150 companies across the food and drink industry, including the prepared consumer foods sector and, within that sector, a group of prepared consumer meats companies.  These companies produce cooked, cured and other value-added meat products.  They employ more than 2,800 people and buy over &euro;230 million worth of goods and services domestically every year.  <\/p>  <p>  The food industry has been identified as an essential service by Government and so, along with other essential services, has to remain open while dealing with the risks of the pandemic.  Our members have introduced stringent control and mitigation measures since mid-March in addition to fully implementing the prevention and control measures in the national Return to Work Safely Protocol and the specific HSE guidance for meat processing.  The measures include engineering and organisational controls, physical distancing measures such as Perspex screens, enhanced biosecurity measures, temperature checking, training and information, and the provision of personal protective equipment.  Verification of this has been overseen by the Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Agriculture and the Marine.  Both announced and unannounced inspections have taken place in the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  Despite the nation&rsquo;s ongoing efforts, the Covid-19 virus remains in our community.  A very unfortunate but inevitable outcome of this is the transmission of the disease within clusters.  Where cases of Covid-19 have been detected, our members have responded in accordance with the specific HSE guidance for meat processing, in particular the steps to be taken when an individual case of Covid-19 is suspected or confirmed and the additional steps to be taken as soon as an outbreak is detected.  Their approaches have been informed by public health expertise at all times and agreed with the HSE through frequent communication.<\/p>  <p>  With no clear timeline for the development of a vaccine, it is essential that, as a country and as an economy, we operate responsibly within this uncertainty.  We must take appropriate measures to ensure the continuity of essential businesses and protect our economy.  This must involve Government, public health officials and businesses working together to ensure that there is a proportionate response to outbreaks within the community.  The experience of the sector to date has highlighted a number of key considerations for further testing in communities and workplaces.  With regard to the speed of swabbing and testing, the speed at which positive cases can be identified and isolated from the community and the workplace is vital.  A full site test and turnaround of results within 24 hours is critical.<\/p> <p>Without this, there will be problems of business continuity.  Public health authorities must ensure there will be sufficient capacity in the system throughout the testing programme.<\/p> <p> On the issue of data protection, GDPR issues are hampering critical information being swiftly provided to site management.  There can be no delay between the communication of results to individuals and to management.  Given the public health imperative, solutions will need to be developed in this area.<\/p> <p> In terms of business continuity and sustainability, clarity is needed on outcome scenarios, for instance what number or proportion of the workforce testing positive would trigger specific further responses by the HSE.  These scenarios must be mapped out in a proportionate and co-ordinated way, taking account of the essential nature of food processing and the critical need to keep supply chains open to customers in Ireland and in export markets.  If supply to these customers is interrupted for even a short period that business will not be easily won back.<\/p> <p> As our economy and society continues to open up, it is likely that other sectors will experience cases and clusters.  In this context, it is vital that a considered and co-ordinated approach is developed for the food sector, which can be rolled out to other sectors as needed.  This approach must be proportionate, take account of the essential nature of food processing and be grounded in expert advice from the health authorities.  Our members will continue to focus on protecting employees through stringent prevention and control measures and to work with the public health authorities in this regard<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300031#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597288200,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for his presentation and for sticking to the time allocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300032#MM00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1597288200,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for being present.

I will answer some of them and I will ask my colleague, Mr. Cormac Healy, to answer others.<\/p>  <p>  I will start with the question on whether mass testing is routine in plants.<\/p> <p> There were approximately six plants with large clusters in April and May, when mass testing occurred.  The process was to test all staff on-site, return only the staff who tested negative to the plant and continue in operation subsequently.  At a later point, the individuals who had tested negative were also tested again, meaning there would have been a first round of overall testing and then a second test of people who had tested negative.  This happened in approximately six sites but since that time there has been no mass testing protocol.<\/p> <p> We welcome the Government announcement about serial testing.  As I indicated in my opening statement, it is critical that there is an effective track and trace system with a very quick response time of between 12 and 24 hours for results.  We need to have clear and unambiguous advance communication of how these protocols will operate.  The Deputy asked about HSA inspections.  As I stated at my previous appearance before the committee, we welcome and encourage unannounced inspections.  We have absolutely no difficulty with that.<\/p> <p> The Deputy asked about virus spread in plants and whether systems within plants would accelerate it.  There is a hypothesis as to why large clusters of Covid-19 may have occurred in some meat plants and not in others.  This is based on two assumptions, with the first being that a super-spreading event may have occurred within each of those plants in which large numbers of workers tested positive, and the second being that aerosol transmission of infection or dispersal of virus from an infected person over distances greater than 2 m could occur.

I will start with the representatives from the HSA.  I thank them for their contributions.  Other witnesses spoke at our earlier session about various regulations that could have been put in place but that are not in place.  I refer specifically to the categories of notifiable illnesses in this regard.  If a worker at a meat plant or any other workplace contracts an infectious disease, whether contracted in work or brought in, there is no obligation to report that to the HSA.  However, if a worker were to trip on loose machinery or injure himself or herself on a floorboard, that would have to be reported.  There seems to be a lacuna.  I am aware that this requirement was included in the primary legislation, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, and was then taken out on foot of a ministerial order in 2016.  We have heard testimony from the unions that it would be very helpful to reintroduce that requirement.  What are the HSA's views on the matter?  It is my understanding, and perhaps the witnesses can elaborate on this, that were Covid a notifiable illness, the HSA would have a range of sanctions, powers and inspections available to it and its teams.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300036#QQ00100","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597290000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I will go back to the point I made already.  This is a public health-led initiative.  There is a pandemic going on and, therefore, the infectious disease regulations under public health are the primary legislation whereby a doctor or someone in a laboratory has to report this illness.  It is very important that those regulations are in place because this is not a once-off.  It does not just affect one worker and then stops.  It can affect that one worker, his or her co-workers, family and colleagues when he or she goes out socialising.  It is important that public health takes the lead on this.  If we do not lead this as a public health matter, the impact will go from the workplace out to society and back in again.<\/p>  <p>  As regards notifiable diseases, we are working with the outbreak control teams.  We are aware of where the outbreaks are occurring and are engaging with them as they happen.  The primary driver in all this effort must be getting the outbreak under control.  It is in everybody's interest to do that.  That is why it has to be led in this way.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the legislative basis for reporting.  There is a lot of different legislation.  Under the current 2005 legislation and our general application regulations, fatalities and accidents are reported by the employer.  The employers know what is happening on the ground and they can report that.  That is the case in many of these meat plants.  I know of one where an injury was reported just recently.  Employers will often not know the result of a test as the worker may not have told them, which is why public health and infectious disease regulations are primary here.  We are looking at that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300036#QQ00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1597290000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but I am conscious that we are short on time.  I agree with Dr. McGuinness that the primary legislation, which in this case is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, is paramount.  All other regulations, secondary legislation and ministerial orders are delegated legislation.  The constitutional power of the Oireachtas is in passing primary legislation and that is what we are dealing with here.  I take Dr. McGuinness' view that it may not be appropriate to include this requirement in that legislation but that was not the view held by the Oireachtas when it passed it in 2005, or while it was enforced for 11 years subsequently.  A Minister then took it on himself to change those regulations.  Perhaps there was lobbying; perhaps not.  However, that was a secondary measure and the primary legislation is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  I wonder whether it was <i>ultra vires<\/i>to take that requirement out afterwards by ministerial order, as it was a primary Act being changed?<\/p><p>Are the inspectors in workplaces all HSA staff?

Its conclusion highlighted widespread improper relationships between the beef industry and Government.  A shocking set of scandals was uncovered and virtually nothing happened.  No one was held to account and public trust was totally eroded.  If we fast-forward to today, for months journalists have reported that workers are frightened to speak out about their horrendous working conditions without anonymity for fear of retribution.  We have known since before May that this situation was likely to occur due to national and global trends and the unique setting in these workplaces that put them at greater risk of clusters of Covid-19.  It is physically impossible for staff to be 2 m apart in many plants.<\/p> <p>Not one improvement or prohibition notice has been issued in the light of inspections.  The meat industry is still worth billions of euros and yet the budget set aside for inspections in comparison to this is a pittance.  Of the 15,338 meat plant workers, 8,896 are migrant workers.  The non-EU workers are bound to their employers by their work permits.  Some 90% of workers get no sick pay so they are of course more likely to turn up for work if they have symptoms of Covid-19.  There has not been a ban on subcontracting in this sector.  <\/p> <p> The Minister for Health has said that he personally thinks that factories with clusters should close.  The T&aacute;naiste has said that the power exists under the public health legislation for the HSE to order businesses to close and yet this did not happen.<\/p> <p> Our Government has closed down entire counties and hundreds of businesses but somehow lacks the power to close plants with confirmed clusters.  That these plans have since voluntarily closed is irrelevant at this point.<\/p> <p> History has shown us that this industry has very considerable political clout and that the Government has turned a blind eye to the industry&rsquo;s scandalous failings in the past.  Objectively, it is completely unreasonable to ask other businesses where there have been no outbreaks to close while allowing the main source of these clusters to remain open.  It speaks volumes about the powerful interests that control the sector and raises questions about some of their political connections today.

We believe the lockdown was completely unjustified and that the constituency is being punished for the inaction of the national outbreak control team and the Government in getting to grips with the problem in meat factories.  That is the outline of this.<\/p>  <p>  I have two questions.  My first is for Mr. Healy.  There is huge concern among farmers.  Farmers and workers have been treated very badly by the meat factories.  I have been very consistent in saying that and I say it again today.  They have been very badly treated.  The price of beef has slightly improved and not before time.  I want assurances that this crisis will not be used as an excuse to cut the price of beef for beef and suckler farmers.  They cannot take any more hits and I want assurances on that from Mr. Healy.  What is Meat Industry Ireland doing to ensure that this does not happen because we need to protect our producers and workers?<\/p>  <p>  My second question is on the 24 hour testing time, which I welcome.  Does MII agree with the Government's approach that the duration of the testing should be four weeks?  I suspect it should be much  longer than four weeks because we saw 828 cases of Covid in meat factories in May and we now have well over 1,400.  I want to know what MII's views are on the duration of testing.  I also want a response to my query on farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Is the fact that an employer cannot contact the HSA directly if there is a Covid case in a plant a barrier and an obstacle ?  It is very clear that we have not got to grips with this problem and other people, constituents and regions are suffering as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300044#YY00600","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597294200,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Our work and focus continues to be around protocols and dealing with the new testing regime.

Across the European economy, there has been some reopening of economies and some recovery in food service which has helped.  Where it goes from here I do not know, but every effort is made to find the best markets delivering the best return.  The price is stronger than it was at this time last year.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific question about the four weeks' duration of testing, I understand from the Government's announcements thus far that it is proposing serial testing similar to what has been done in other areas.<\/p> <p>It is proposed that testing be carried out weekly for four weeks in order to root out the problem, if there is one.  I cannot offer advice on that.  I would like to think that, across the wide range of plants out there, this testing will not find much.  Many plants have had few or no cases.  As our chairman said in his opening statement, during the two months up to early August there were only five individual cases among our primary meat-processing members.

The first or primary function of the Health and Safety Authority under the Act is the prevention of personal injury which, as I have said, includes disease.<\/p>  <p>  As the authority's representatives have said, and as we now understand, the regulations do not impose a duty on employers to notify anyone of an outbreak of disease or infection within the place of employment.  There is such a duty in respect of any other type of personal injury.  I believe I am correct in saying that, at the moment, if an employee tells management that he or she has tested positive for Covid, that it appears he or she has had it for a number of days or even a week, and that he or she has been interacting with other staff within the place of work, the employer has no duty to notify the Health and Safety Authority of that.<\/p>  <p>  I have three questions.  Is the Health and Safety Authority satisfied that the regulations as set out and the factual situation are in harmony with the Act and the HSA's duties thereunder?

We are reviewing the matter as we speak within the authority and we will bring forward a discussion paper in due course for the Department and our board.<br\/><br\/>I feel we have the required level of connection with public health.  I go back to the point, which is really important, that an individual might have Covid and tell his employer, but it is not necessarily the case that he got it in the workplace.  He could have got it out playing sport or out socialising.  He could have been on leave or whatever else.  It is a difficult one because, in effect, the reporting relates to the work activity and that is the challenge we have.

Meat plants are dominated by a small number of big players.  I would argue that the reputation of meat plants is pretty much in tatters.  Are meat plants on a self-destructive pathway?

Unfortunately, we now have one plant that has had an outbreak.  Not all the information is known about that, but the plant had gone through the entire period of the pandemic, since the middle of March, without a single case.  We continue to work on that.

They described how toilet doors were locked open, which meant that women and particularly young women who may be menstruating were forced to use toilets with open doors.  They would have been forced to tend to their intimate hygiene practically in the open.

Mr. Healy said that Covid-19 travels through communities into the industrial settings rather than <i>vice versa<\/i>, which to a degree is true.  However, we have heard of workers who are living within their own community.  They frequently live in overcrowded conditions and lack the necessary space and privacy we all deserve as human beings.  There has been talk of hotbeds where one staff member gets up and another person gets into their bed.  I was talking about the balance of power there.  These workers are further disadvantaged because they are here in Ireland under the work permit regime.  Some 80% of the workers are not born in Ireland; they are foreign workers who have been brought in.  They are tied to their employers and their employment.  Wage deductions are made for accommodation.  It reminds me of the indentured servitude we hear about in the Middle East where migrant workers are abused like this.  Mr. Healy said he does not believe agency work is that big a factor.  It is called precarious employment.  I think it is bogus self-employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300047#BBB01000","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1597295400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>The Deputy might want to conclude to allow the witness to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300048#CCC00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1597295400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Healy to respond to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020081300048#CCC00300","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1597295400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify that 20% of the workforce rather than 80% of the workforce are on work permits.

There is a requirement that the employer would work with a permit holder to source accommodation.  The workers are not committed to using that, but many of them will use it in the first instance.  I believe that accommodation is also checked to verify that piece of the permit legislation is being done and that the employer is helping them sourcing accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that the hot-bedding, as was referred to, should not be tolerated.

In response to Deputy Cairns's comments on shutting down meet plants, Mr. Carroll asked \"is that where we want to be in our economy\" and whether we should shut down after \"five, six, or seven or so positive cases\".  I must put it to him that, the day after it was announced that we would not move to phase 4, the acting Chief Medical Officer cited 12 cases of infection in the hospitality sector over the previous week, which were partly used to justify not moving to phase 4 and opening up many rural pubs.  The difference strikes me.  We have heard about 30 announced inspections and how many meat plants have not even been inspected.  There is a major contrast between how the hospitality sector has been treated and how the meat industry has been treated in terms of inspections and the manpower allocated to said inspections.<\/p> <p>Can Mr. Carroll tell me what magic touch the meat industry has in Ireland in that it is treated so differently from any other sector?

We had no cases for a period of two months, and in the recent case, it had no cases for five months.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard here repeatedly that the problem of compliance does not exist - in other words, everybody is completely compliant with the terms of the engagement with the HSE as regards the protocols.

I refer to conditions for workers, perhaps outside the workplace, such as accommodation and transport to work.  Were and are they aware of different arrangements?  How did workers travel to work?
