My department through Enterprise Ireland has allocated &euro;235 million to 72 projects and 270 partners which are working together in collaborative, disruptive, industrial research projects, with strong commercialisation potential. A new Call for projects is currently open and will close on 10 February 2022. If successful, the innovations emerging from the DTIF will offer Irish companies a route to compete in and potentially disrupt global markets, leading to increased employment, increased exports and which potentially could lead to companies that meet the definition of a unicorn start-up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000057#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000057#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[6936\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000057#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the details of the funding commitment to supporting decarbonisation of the SME sector; the status of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>My Department has recently been awarded funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Fund to grant aid projects to accelerate decarbonisation of the enterprise sector.

That is not to mention the thousands of other businesses they have helped with additional supports such as training and mentoring programmes, the Trading Online Voucher scheme, LEAN for Micro, Green for Micro and the Start Your Own Business programme. <\/p>  <p>  Housed within the 31 Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices are at the very heart of business development and entrepreneurship in towns and communities right across the country.  This is shown by the figures reported, with 85% of Local Enterprise Office client company employment based outside of Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  In 2021 Ireland&rsquo;s small business community faced the perfect storm with a global pandemic, Brexit and international supply chain issues.  With compassion, expertise, and enthusiasm the Local Enterprise staff have worked tirelessly with small business owners to see what was possible, how things could work differently and find solutions to the issues facing businesses. This has included diversification of their products or services, pivoting to online trading, sourcing new suppliers or paths to market, and exploring foreign markets.<\/p>  <p>  While challenges remain in 2022, there is resilience in the Irish business community and a renewed optimism for the future growth of our small and micro businesses. Therefore we anticipate, that with the right measures in place, employment in the LEO client companies will increase by 3,500. <\/p>  <p>  The additional &euro;2m allocated to the Local Enterprise Offices in Budget 2022 will help in achieving this goal and allow the Local Enterprise Offices to continue to provide focused guidance in the areas of sustainability and greening their businesses and also digitalisation and e-commerce.<\/p>  <p>  The Green for Micro programme, launched in March 2021, will receive additional funding this year.  This scheme enables businesses to take those first steps on becoming more sustainable. Businesses now know this is not just about protecting the environment and achieving cost savings but that their partners and customers are demanding sustainable business practices. <\/p>  <p>  In the past two years more than 17,000 Irish businesses have been approved for the Trading Online Voucher, which has enabled them to open their virtual doors to the world.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2022 we will work with small businesses to begin or continue their journey of digitalisation.  Similar to the Green for Micro scheme, a new digitalisation programme will help businesses take those first steps and see how the process can benefit their business. Exporting and selling into new markets has never been easier for small businesses and we plan to assist more businesses to grow, scale and reach export stage in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's small businesses can compete with the best in the world, and through the Local Enterprise Offices, we will give them the tools to help them achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000058#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Policy","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000058#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[6803\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000058#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of the Mid-East Regional Enterprise Plan.","asker":"1583","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>Regional enterprise development and sustainable local job creation is a key policy priority of mine and this Government.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout 2021, my Department has overseen the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024.

This is a medium-term employment target to grow employment and crucially to ensure that these jobs are more productive, innovative, resilient and in new areas of opportunity.  <\/p><p>Ireland saw robust increases in employment in the latter part of 2021.  The Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey (LFS) Quarter 3 results published on 25th November show that employment levels are approaching the 2.5 million target set for 2024 in the Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan.The growth in employment follows similar growth in Q2 and is reflective of the success of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help workers and businesses throughout the pandemic, allowing them to return to work relatively quickly as public health restrictions eased and the Government&rsquo;s vaccination programme was rolled out.<\/p><p>Overall employment levels recovered to 2,471,200 as of Q3 2021, exceeding pre-pandemic levels for the first time. Employment increased in all 14 economic sectors between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021. This reflects the high level of Government supports for more exposed sectors, but also the strong performance of sectors that have been largely insulated from the pandemic. <\/p><p>The recent wave of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 has seen widespread global disruption across economies and societies, including in Ireland. While the monthly unemployment rate was 5.3 percent in January 2022, the COVID-adjusted unemployment rate stood at 7.8% in January 2022, up from 7.5%, in December 2021, and 6.9% in November 2021, but down significantly from 21.7% in December 2020. As the economy re-opens, it is anticipated that numbers in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the COVID adjusted unemployment rate will begin to fall.<\/p><p>The extension of key supports for businesses and employees as the economy reopens provides a bridge to facilitate a continuing and wider economic recovery over the early part of this year. While some companies will face challenges as supports are gradually withdrawn in line with the evolution of the COVID-19 situation, employment growth, robust economic growth, and strong exchequer figures point to a resilient economy, which bodes well for the medium-term trajectory, and indicates the value of the economic supports during the pandemic. <\/p><p>The Plan is about the sustainable rebuilding and renewal of our economy, across four pillars: Helping people back into work with supports, intense activation and accelerated reskilling and upskilling opportunities, through Pathways to Work 2021-2025;  Re-building sustainable enterprises by future-proofing enterprise to be more resilient, innovative, and productive;  A balanced and inclusive recovery through strategic investment in infrastructure and reforms that enhance our long-term capacity for sustainable growth, balanced regional development and by improving living standards; and Ensuring sustainable public finances.<\/p><p>Progress on the wide range of deliverables and workstreams across the four pillars towards this overall ambition is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment and related sub-groups and Senior Official Groups and progress towards the various targets will continue to be monitored carefully.  Employment performance and quality will be a core part of this process. A progress report will be advanced in the coming period which will outline the progress the Plan has made in transitioning Ireland&rsquo;s economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000059#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000059#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[6806\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000059#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he has received the Company Law Reform Group report on the splitting of assets.","asker":"1568","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>The Company Law Review Group (CLRG) is a statutory advisory body charged with advising the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on matters pertaining to company law.

The global natural gas price spiked in December, and has been volatile since, due to a combination of international geopolitical factors, lower-than-usual reserves, and regional supply chain and weather issues. <\/p>  <p>  I am extremely conscious of the pressure that high and volatile electricity costs can put on a business, particularly small enterprises, those with tight margins and those particularly dependent on certain fuels.Energy bills can be an inflexible component of the cost base of a business in the short-term; and in certain energy intensive sectors, these are a key element of competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  Energy costs are volatile historically. Ireland is particularly dependent on natural gas for electricity generation, heating and industry, and therefore recent international price spikes are a cause for concern for the Government and a threat to competitiveness. However, these increases are unlikely to last indefinitely as the market responds. Recent global price volatility for fuels is yet another reminder that our society and our businesses should increasingly be looking to reduce our exposure to fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European Union regulatory regime in which electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas. The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on general energy regulatory matters to CRU for timely direct reply.<\/p>  <p>  To deliver price competitiveness over the medium-term, Government is determined to deliver a diversified energy system, with significant support for energy efficiency and renewables, alongside independent regulation that protects consumers and delivers efficient, competitive energy retail and wholesale markets. <\/p>  <p>  There are a range of incentives and advice available to business to help them use energy efficiently, diversify their fuel use and switch to renewable energy sources. Small businesses can currently receive an energy audit voucher from SEAI to get professional advice on how to increase efficiency and reduce their costs. Other financial supports include incentives for electric vehicles, the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat, grants for microgeneration, the EXCEED programme, as well as GreenStart and GreenPlus programmes available from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.

Of the 246 investments won in 2020, more than half went to regional locations.  Similarly in 2021, of the 249 investments secured by the IDA, over half (133) were for locations outside Dublin.  The IDA is doing everything it can to encourage investors to locate in regional areas. This includes actively marketing potential investment sites outside of our main cities and working to develop recognised industry clusters that will attract overseas investors to regional locations. <\/p>  <p>  A key strategic investment priority in the NDP is investing in regional growth and resilience.  My Department has approved over &euro;126 million in funding to 79 enterprise strengthening projects in every region over a series of competitive calls since 2017.  In addition to the &euro;5 million allocation for regional enterprise funding in Budget 2022, my officials are in the process of exploring new significant sources of funding to drive implementation of the nine new Regional Enterprise Plans.

The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy. However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.<\/p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review.<\/p>  <p>  Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment, and  Ireland was one of the few countries which has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  My Department has issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 at the end of January 2022, which is now stabilising.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.  <\/p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other non-standard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises the impact delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has developed a plan of action to reduce processing times built up over the pandemic. My Department has approved a trebling of staff in the employment permits section in order to deal with the increase in applications.  <\/p>  <p>  As the plan to deal with this issue is implemented and begins to take effect, we expect to see improvements shortly, with the backlog considerably reduced by the end of Q1 and substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.  My Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.

Morally we need to make sure the world is vaccinated. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, International Trade is a competence of the EU under the Treaties and in exercising that competence, the European Commission engages fully with the Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committees and Working Parties\/Groups.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the EU, we are very strong advocates of what is called compulsory licensing, which allows governments to license the production of vaccines on a generic basis, including without consent of the pharmaceutical companies. It could be very useful for countries which have vaccine-making capacity, to be allowed to license the production of those vaccines in the plants in their countries, irrespective of whether those companies give agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The EU has been genuinely flexible and seeking to find a solution to make it easier for governments to allow third parties to manufacture COVID-19 pharmaceutical products.  A TRIPS waiver, by itself, will not result in any new vaccine plants being built or made operational.  <\/p>  <p>  We have an open mind on the alternative suggestion of a TRIPS waiver. We have always said that if we receive a WTO proposal in writing, we will look at it. That has not happened yet.  <\/p>  <p>  Discussions are ongoing in the WTO to find a common understanding among Members on how the WTO can contribute to an effective response to any pandemic, not just the current one.  <\/p>  <p>  The challenges have changed since the waiver proposal was first put forward over a year ago, with fair distribution of vaccines, diversifying production across the regions, and vaccine hesitancy among populations now cited as being among the main obstacles to getting the world vaccinated.  The focus is also shifting from vaccines production to administering vaccinations and how strengthening health systems and their preparedness is pivotal in the achievement of the 70% vaccination target by mid-2022.<\/p>  <p>  What is needed is capacity, know-how, qualified scientists and technicians, capital, and experienced medicine and safety regulators. All those things are needed to get the vaccine from the lab into people's arms. We need a global solution that is comprehensive, intelligent, workable and that does not disincentivise innovation.<\/p>  <p>  The WHO recently stated that it sees a very positive outlook for supply of vaccines for 2022, that this is predicated on the continuation of dose sharing and manufacturers honouring deals brokered under COVAX, and that unequal distribution, rather than supply, could compromise global access to vaccines.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has committed to donate up to 5 million COVID-19 vaccines.  To date, a total of 2.9 million have been accepted as donations and of these over 1.3m have been delivered to countries including Uganda, Nigeria, Indonesia and Ghana. In addition, Ireland has committed &euro;13.5 million in financing to COVAX facility to facilitate the purchase of vaccines by low and lower middle-income countries and to cover the ancillary costs associated with vaccine donations.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has been the leading exporter of vaccines; out of a total of 3.5 billion doses produced, the EU has exported over 1.7 billion doses to 165 countries.  Team Europe has contributed &euro;3 billion in financial support to the COVAX programme and is on target to donate 700 million doses by mid-2022.  It is also investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government is a strong supporter of vaccine equity and has pledged to do all it can to ensure that there is universal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.  Furthermore, it will continue to work with those countries who have yet to build the infrastructure needed to rollout a vaccine programme.  The Government will do this through aid programmes that help with refrigeration, distribution, and administration, and all these elements are necessary for the rollout of successful vaccination programmes around the world.  This includes supporting the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000061#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Policy","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000061#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[6805\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000061#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will report on the Dublin Regional Enterprise Plan.","asker":"1568","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>Regional enterprise development and sustainable local job creation is a key policy priority of mine and this Government.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout 2021, my Department has overseen the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024.

The system is designed to supplement Ireland's skills and labour supply over the short to medium term by allowing enterprises to recruit nationals from outside the EEA, where such skills or expertise cannot be sourced from within the EEA at that time.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. <\/p><p>A key to the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s overarching policy strategies is human capital, primarily through cultivating an indigenous pool of talent and labour. The employment permits system plays a supporting role in the delivery of these strategies by supplementing the labour and skills base where gaps are identified.  <\/p><p>The system is vacancy led and managed through the operation of the occupation lists: the critical skills list in respect of skills that are in critical shortage in the labour market and the ineligible occupations lists for which a ready source of labour is available from within Ireland and the EEA. <\/p><p>The lists are reviewed twice a year to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements, guided by available research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), and the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS. Cognisance is also taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and contextual factors such as Brexit and more recently COVID 19 and their impact on the labour market.  <\/p><p>The Department works with other Government Departments via the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group to promote an integrated approach to address labour and skills shortages in the longer term. Where shortages are clearly evidenced, the employment permit system is flexible enough to address them in real time.<\/p><p>As part of this review process, the Department also invites submissions from industry representatives and stakeholders. The submission process is an opportunity for stakeholders to provide additional information and potentially different perspectives on the nature and extent of skill shortages.  Stakeholder submissions are a vital source of information, helping inform the Department&rsquo;s final assessment of the status of occupations. <\/p><p>The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the labour market and economy was a significant consideration in the outcome of the reviews conducted since the onset of the pandemic.  However, changes were made during 2021 to extend eligibility for an employment permit to those sectors most impacted by the pandemic, addressing the more immediate skills and labour shortages across key economic sectors including the Health, Agri\/Food and Hospitality sectors.<\/p><p>In order to address some inflexibilities in the system, my Department is currently drafting a new Employment Permits Bill to increase the agility and responsiveness of the system, to modernise it and to ensure that it is capable of adapting to rapid changes in the needs of the labour market of the future and to fluctuation in demand contingent on the economic cycle.<\/p><p>Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the medium term, but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce, with an emphasis on the process of lifelong learning, and on maximising the potential of EEA nationals to fill our skills deficits. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000061#WRF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Digital Strategy","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000061#WRF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[6804\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000061#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the role his Department will play in Harnessing Digital - The Digital Ireland Framework.","asker":"1583","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>Last week the Government launched the new National Digital Strategy called Harnessing Digital - The Digital Ireland Framework.<\/p><p>The Strategy sets out a high-level framework to support our ambition for Ireland to be a digital leader, at the heart of European and global digital developments.<\/p><p>Implementation of the National Digital Strategy, and relevant EU and regulatory issues, will be overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and supported by official led sub-groups namely, the Digital Issues Senior Officials&rsquo;

There are a number of factors at play in the market including energy prices which remain well above January 2021 levels. Increased global demand particularly from the big grain-producing countries, controls of fertiliser exports from large fertiliser producing countries, increased transport costs and EU-imposed tariffs and duties on certain Third Country imports are all impacting prices here for our farmers.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been following the rising fertiliser price issue closely for the past number of months. In October 2021, I tasked Teagasc to lay out a credible roadmap to assist farmers in the short-term, as well as offering a long-term solution in the move to reduce dependency on chemical fertiliser. I launched the Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc Ballyhaise on the 26th January.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a strategy that can ease the price pressure on farmers. It is a strategy that will be good for the environment and good for the pocket. <\/p>  <p>  I have raised the issue a number of times at European level too. At the November Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I again raised the increasing challenge faced by farmers due to the rising costs of inputs. I called on the EU Commission to seriously consider all options to ease the pressure on farmers at this time, including the question of whether the imposition of anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports continues to be appropriate and for this matter to be examined as a priority.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the November meeting, I wrote to the EU Commissioner Wojciechowski requesting that the Commissions assessment of the ongoing appropriateness of anti-dumping duties on fertilisers is completed as a matter of priority. The EU Commission responded, on 26th January, to say that they are still collecting information to establish the relevant facts.  <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, Teagasc will continue to work with farmers through the Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser campaign to help farmers to adapt to the current fertiliser market and support them to make informed decisions on what is best for them and their farms. <\/p>  <p>  Teagasc has put together a comprehensive information pack for farmers and their advisors - through a compendium of 20 factsheets - to optimise the use of plant nutrients and to help farmers address the challenge of maintaining their farm outputs in the face of rising fertiliser costs and reduced availability.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a new &euro;1 million initiative by my Department will support the planting of multi-species swards in order to reduce dependence on fertilisers. <\/p>  <p>  A pilot Soil Sampling Programme has also been introduced, which will provide farmers with comprehensive details of the soil health and soil condition of their farm. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, Ireland is a relatively small market in respect of fertiliser sales and their usage compared to many of our EU neighbours.  As a result, Irish fertiliser companies are price-takers that are dependent on global fertiliser supply and demand.  It is to be hoped that we may see a levelling off at least of some of these contributing rising price factors this year.  This is not to diminish the pressures being faced by out farmers today, however. <\/p>  <p>  The initiatives I have introduced should support farmers reduce their dependence on fertiliser.  I assure this House that both me and my Department will continue to closely monitor the situation. We will continue to examine all options to ease the burden on farmers in the short and long term. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000062#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000062#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[6879\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000062#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the significance of data monitoring, reporting and verification in order that the reduction of farm-related emissions are reflected in national figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue of data measuring, reporting and verification (MRV). While ultimately this a matter for the EPA and my Government colleague Minister Ryan in terms of the reporting of the inventory, I am happy to provide my views. <\/p>  <p>  Measurement, Reporting and Verification is something that is going to take on increased significance in the context of achieving our climate targets over this decade. Agriculture and Land based emissions are broken down into two inventory categories, the agriculture inventory and the Land use, land use change and forestry inventory, more commonly referred to as LULUCF. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the agriculture inventory, the main sources of information that impact on the inventory are derived from the Central Statistics Office. Data sources include dairy cow numbers, suckler cow numbers, and sheep numbers. The fertiliser sales statistics also play a key role in determining total emissions. <\/p>  <p>  The LULUCF inventory is more complicated from a Measurement Reporting and Verification perspective. It is important that the protection of carbon pools and the increased removal and storage of atmospheric carbon brought about through the activities of our farmers is recognised in the National Inventory Reporting accounting system. <\/p>  <p>  In recent months significant funding allocations through my Department will allow for the better understanding of farm derived emissions. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I highlight the recent establishment of the National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory (NASCO) for the measurement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a range of different soil and farm types. The outputs from this project will place Ireland at the forefront of EU carbon sequestration research. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the Soil Carbon Observatory I have also recently launched the Pilot Soil Sampling and Analysis Programme which will provide a baseline assessment of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The knowledge gained from these activities will place Ireland at the forefront of research in carbon farming while also allowing for the refinement of our reporting to the National Inventory further emphasising the sustainability of the agricultural sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000062#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[6880\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000062#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the research priorities of both his Department and agencies under its remit to assist farmers in reducing emissions on their farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>The reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture and the central role farmers can play in this, while protecting farm family incomes, is a key priority for the Government. The Food Vision 2030 strategy, which aims to facilitate a sustainable and competitive agri-food system that is climate resilient and neutral, putting research and innovation at its core and I am glad to have the opportunity today to mention just a few of these investments. <\/p>  <p>  At the outset, it is important to say that my Department provides funding for &ldquo;public good&rdquo; research through national and international competitive funding mechanisms. In addition, much of the grant-in-aid allocation to Teagasc, such as the &euro;147m provided in 2021, is directed towards research and farmer advisory activities related to climate-smart and sustainable agriculture.<\/p>  <p>  The strong commitment of my Department to research in the area of climate change is demonstrated by last year&rsquo;s national call under the Department&rsquo;s thematic research strand. This provided funding of over &euro;12 million to 10 projects in climate and environment related research, accounting for 60% of the overall spend in this call. This will build on previous research in developing the necessary tools, technologies, and practices to reduce and mitigate GHG emissions from ruminant livestock, sequester carbon and improve the health of agroecosystems.<\/p>  <p>  The Food Vision 2030 Strategy highlights some specific areas for enhanced research, including novel feed additives for reducing methane emissions, grass and multi-species swards that require lower levels of nitrogen inputs, grass biorefining for increased nitrogen efficiency and lowering emissions, and animal genetics that enable the breeding of livestock with lower emissions. <\/p>  <p>  I am following through on these recommendations in the various funding instruments my Department operate and this will build on previous commitments made. For example, the &lsquo;Meth-abate&rsquo; project which has screened a range of potential feed additives and is testing their effects on reducing emissions. Or the &lsquo;GreenBreed&rsquo; project which has developed an index to rank dairy bulls on expected carbon output, which can then be combined with the Economic Breeding Index (EBI) to breed animals that are more economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. <\/p>  <p>  The Food Vision 2030 Strategy also points to the need for Irish research to build partnerships and collaboration internationally. This is an area that my Department has been active in through a dedicated International Outreach Strand. In 2021 for example, my Department committed up to &euro;2.5m through European initiatives to research calls in the areas of GHG emission reduction and soil Carbon sequestration. We have also been longstanding members of the Global Research Alliance for Agricultural Greenhouse Gasses and more recently, have partnered on the United States-United Arab Emirates led initiative, the &lsquo;Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate&rsquo;, which will lead to an increased investment in climate related research. Our involvement in these international research efforts enable the exchange of scientific expertise and exploit synergies and efficiencies in areas such as experimentation and research infrastructures. I believe this is critically important for addressing shared global challenges, such as Climate Change, and I intend to build on these going forward.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I believe it is also important to point to the role that knowledge transfer and extension services have in translating the outputs of all these research efforts into practical applications on farms. If research outputs are not adopted by the end-user, it is a waste of resources. Developing a dynamic knowledge exchange environment is a core ambition in the Food Vision 2030 Strategy and initiatives such as the SignPost Farms programme, or the proposed Knowledge Transfer Programme in our CAP Strategic Plan, can play a significant role in ensuring farmers have access to the latest research outputs. <\/p>  <p>  Sustainability in its all its guises - economic, environmental and societal - are key to protecting and enhancing our sector over the next decade. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000062#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Missions","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000062#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[7071\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000062#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the destinations for official trade missions planned by his Department for 2022.","asker":"1593","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>The Department continues to support the ambition of the Irish agri-food sector to grow both the value and volume of our exports to international markets.

My Department is providing up to &euro;1.9m in research funding for three projects  investigating the sustainable management of soil and ensure it can sustainably perform its multiple functions, including soil sequestration (&lsquo;SQUARE&rsquo;);  how carbon sequestration on agricultural land could provide mitigation options while maintaining agricultural production (&lsquo;Agri-SOC&rsquo;); and understanding Carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes (&lsquo;Farm-Carbon&rsquo;) from the contribution of hedgerows and non-forest woodland.<\/p>  <p>  One of the central themes of my Departments 2021 national competitive research Call was Climate, with the objective to support climate-smart research to improve, integrate and develop novel systems which support carbon sequestration. From this Call, my Department recently awarded research funding of up to &euro;1.8m for two projects exploring new measures to enhance carbon sinks and displace fossil fuel emissions. The first of these, LAB-MACC, will quantify mitigation associated with a range of new measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance land carbon sinks, and displace fossil fuel emissions, potentially enabling farmers to receive credit for emissions reduction. The second, &lsquo;REWET&rsquo;, will investigate how developing actions to restore the water table on drained carbon-rich soils can enhance carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. <\/p>  <p>  In connection with the ongoing investment into the establishment of a National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory, my Department is co-funding a project with the EPA which aims to support the mapping of Irish Peatlands to refine the assessment of land-use change and greenhouse gas removals from a range of different soil and farm types. This builds on my Department&rsquo;s involvement with the EU LIFE IP Peatlands and People project which has seen a co-funding commitment of &euro;750,000 in support of research into GHGs and carbon sequestration from grassland farming in peatland. <\/p>  <p>  These recent examples of my Departments commitment to climate research will build on other significant projects.

Technical negotiations with importing countries, including inward visits and inspection by their competent authorities, are typically a lengthy and multifaceted process, often taking several years before bilateral agreements are concluded and trade can commence.  <\/p>  <p>  During the pandemic, some notable successes were achieved, including opening Mexico for Irish pig meat in May 2020 and Japan for Irish beef burgers in March 2021. In April and June 2021, my Department secured changes to our poultry meat certification conditions with Singapore and the United Arab Emirates respectively to maintain access and minimise trade disruption resulting from an outbreak of avian influenza.  <\/p>  <p>  There has also been significant progress in opening markets for Irish lamb producers. In September 2021, I signed a sheep meat protocol with China and the US announcement in December 2021 that its ban on EU sheep meat exports has been lifted removed a major impediment to accessing the American market.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials are working closely with their counterparts and our embassies in Beijing and Washington so that, once the necessary technical measures are agreed and put in place, Ireland can soon export lamb to the world&rsquo;s largest economies.  <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately while it is the role of my Department is to open up international markets, it is up to the industry - with the support of the Department and Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing expertise - to capitalise on those opportunities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000064#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000064#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[7074\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000064#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his proposals to support primary producers via the Brexit Adjustment Reserve.","asker":"1513","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>The Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) aims to provide financial support to the Member States, regions and sectors most affected by Brexit to deal with the adverse economic, social, territorial and, where appropriate, environmental consequences.

The Strategy is honest and upfront about the challenges ahead. Crucially, it proposes solutions and charts a pathway to sustainability in all its dimensions &ndash; environmental, economic and social. One of the stand-out aspects of the Strategy is its adoption of a food systems approach, taking a more holistic view of agri-food by ensuring an interconnectedness between it and the areas of health &amp;amp; nutrition and the environment. <\/p><p>Food Vision aims for Ireland to be a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems. Food Vision 2030 sets out 22 goals under four high-level missions that the sector must achieve if it is to fulfil this ambition:- A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector- Viable and Resilient Primary Producers, with Enhanced Wellbeing- Food that is Safe, Nutritious and Appealing, Trusted and Valued at Home and Abroad- An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Sector, Driven by Technology and Talent.<\/p><p>There are seven Goals in Mission 1 &ldquo;A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-food Sector&rdquo;,  which aim to deliver a climate-neutral food system by 2050, with verifiable progress achieved by 2030, encompassing emissions reductions, carbon sequestration, improvements in air quality, restoration and enhancement of biodiversity, improvements in water quality, development of diverse forests, enhanced seafood sustainability, exploring the bioeconomy and strengthening Origin Green. <\/p><p>Food Vision recognises that environmental targets are set and updated by legislation. It outlines the goals and actions which will provide a strategic framework for achieving those legislative targets.  Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2021, the most ambitious ever produced, was launched last November. The commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector are challenging but I know the sector is committed to the challenge. Delivering real results will require collaboration, cooperation, and a sense of shared responsibility between citizens, industry and the State to deliver our environmental ambitions.<\/p><p>The success of Food Vision will depend on effective implementation and oversight and I chaired the first meeting of the Food Vision High-Level Implementation Committee in November.  In line with one of the outcomes of that first implementation meeting, I recently announced the establishment of a Food Vision Dairy Group, whose first task will be to &ldquo;produce a detailed plan by Q2 2022 to manage the sustainable environmental footprint of the dairy sector&rdquo;.  Given the importance of providing certainty for the sector, I have tasked the Group to provide an initial report to me by end March setting out how emissions associated with the dairy sector can be stabilised, and then reduced, with a final plan to be submitted by the end of quarter two.<\/p><p>A key priority for the Food Vision Dairy Group is ensuring that we continue to provide a platform of sustainability for our farmers and our sector, economically, environmentally and socially. The new Group is chaired by Professor Gerry Boyle and includes representatives from the farming organisations, the dairy industry, my Department and relevant agencies, and they met for the first time earlier this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000065#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Promotion","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000065#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[6986\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000065#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress made by his Department on market development over the past 18 months in particular overcoming the challenges of new barriers to existing markets; his views on whether this work will form part of the solution to the current crisis in pig farming; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>Gaining new market access and enhancing access to existing markets for Irish pigmeat exports is integral to my Department&rsquo;s strategic approach to the development of the agri-food sector generally.<\/p>  <p>  Ministerial led trade missions to priority markets, as well as technical meetings and inward visits and inspections, are a key part of our market development and market access strategy, in cooperation with Bord Bia and our embassy network.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the past two years, Bord Bia has developed a successful model of virtual trade missions, at a time when travel was not possible, keeping Ireland and its quality, sustainable, safe food offering, current, relevant and visible and in line with our Food Vision 2030 strategy.<\/p>  <p>  During the pandemic, my Department has had some notable successes in securing new and enhanced market access, including opening Mexico for Irish pigmeat in May 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me, given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context.

Food Vision 2030, the new stakeholder-led strategy for the agri-food sector, also highlights the challenge of generational renewal and proposes a number of actions, including maintaining the strong level of current support, the promotion of land mobility &amp;amp; succession planning and increased education &amp;amp; promotion of the diversity of careers in the agri-food sector. This reflects the need to ensure a vibrant agricultural sector equipped with skilled and innovative young farmers to respond to societal demands for quality food and environmental public goods. We all agree that facilitating generational renewal is critical to ensure a bright future for the agri-food sector.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there are a range of measures both in the existing CAP and at national level that support younger farmers and facilitate generational renewal. Under the current CAP, the Young Farmers Scheme with payments of &euro;110m benefitting over 8,000 farmers each year, and the National Reserve with &euro;35 million allocated since 2015, provide financial support to young farmers during the crucial early years of setting up a farm enterprise.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, young farmers can avail of a 60% grant rate as compared to the standard rate of 40% and over &euro;150m has been paid to over 6,149 farmers to date. Additional support to young farmers is provided under the Collaborative Farming Grant Scheme. These partnership structures are further supported through the availability of a tax credit at national level of &euro;25,000 over five years to assist with the transfer of farms within &ldquo;Succession Farm Partnerships&rdquo;, promoting and supporting the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, strong national taxation measures assist land mobility and facilitate succession and are estimated to be worth some &euro;200 million per annum. Long-Term Leasing Income Tax Relief has been an important driver of land mobility by providing access to land and security of tenure for younger farmers and a route to retirement for older farmers. Almost 11,000 beneficiaries were supported under this measure in 2018 costing &euro;27.2 million.<\/p>  <p>  On access to finance, the recently launched Brexit Impact Loan Scheme provides finance for working capital, investment and refinancing purposes. Offering unsecured loans up to &euro;500,000, this product is particularly suited to young farmers. To date, 99 loans to the value of &euro;10 million have been sanctioned to farmers. The Future Growth Loan Scheme was developed with assisting young farmers among its objectives and has been in great demand, with almost 1,300 loans to the value of &euro;155 million sanctioned to farmers. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Teagasc's education activities continue to focus on equipping young farmers with the necessary knowledge to build successful careers.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's new CAP Strategic Plan was submitted for approval to the European Commission on 31 December 2021 with a view to commencing delivery in 2023. Stakeholder engagement through the CAP Consultative Committee and bilateral meetings with the main representative bodies will continue during this time. Under the CSP proposals, Ireland will implement the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme in the new CAP programme, dedicating some 3% of the direct payments ceiling to help young farmers establish their farming businesses. This allocation of approximately &euro;35m per year will see qualifying young farmers benefit on a per hectare basis which will be more advantageous to young farmers than the current system, which was linked to payment entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed rate will significantly increase from approximately &euro;70\/ha in the current programme to over &euro;170\/ha, with a maximum payment area of 50 hectares and payment on all eligible hectares, even those without corresponding entitlements.

In October 2021, I tasked Teagasc to lay out a credible roadmap to assist farmers in the short-term, as well as offering a long-term solution in the move to reduce dependency on chemical fertiliser. I launched the Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc Ballyhaise on the 26th January.  This is a strategy that can ease the price pressure on farmers. It is good for the environment and good for the pocket. <\/p>  <p>  I have raised the issue a number of times at European level too. At the November Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I again raised the increasing challenge faced by farmers due to the rising costs of inputs. I called on the EU Commission to seriously consider all options to ease the pressure on farmers at this time, including the question of whether the imposition of anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports continues to be appropriate and for this matter to be examined as a priority.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the November meeting, I wrote to the EU Commissioner Wojciechowski requesting that the Commissions assessment of the ongoing appropriateness of anti-dumping duties on fertilisers is completed as a matter of priority. The EU Commission responded, on 26th January, to say that they are still collecting information to establish the relevant facts.  <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, Teagasc will continue to work with farmers through the Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser campaign to help farmers to adapt to the current fertiliser market and support them to make informed decisions on what is best for them and their farms. <\/p>  <p>   Teagasc has put together a comprehensive information pack for farmers and their advisors - through a compendium of 20 factsheets - to optimise the use of plant nutrients and to help farmers address the challenge of maintaining their farm outputs in the face of rising fertiliser costs and reduced availability.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a new &euro;1 million initiative by my Department will support the planting of multi-species swards in order to reduce dependence on fertilisers. <\/p>  <p>  A pilot Soil Sampling Programme has also been introduced, which will provide farmers with comprehensive details of the soil health and soil condition of their farm. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, Ireland is a relatively small market in respect of fertiliser sales and their usage compared to many of our EU neighbours.  As a result, Irish fertiliser companies are price-takers that are dependent on global fertiliser supply and demand.  It is to be hoped that we may see a levelling off at least of some of these contributing rising price factors this year.  This is not to diminish the pressures being faced by out farmers today, however. <\/p>  <p>  The initiatives I have introduced should support farmers reduce their dependence on fertiliser.  I assure this House that both me and my Department will continue to closely monitor the situation. We will continue to examine all options to ease the burden on farmers in the short and long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000066#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horticulture Sector","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000066#WRL02400"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[7076\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000066#WRL02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress made ascertaining the level of horticultural peat stock available to growers; and if his Department has commissioned experts to provide free advice to those wishing to achieve regulatory compliance for extraction of horticultural peat on sub-30-hectare bogs for supply to the domestic horticulture industry.","asker":"1613","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>On 17th January, my Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), and Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Housing) published a working paper that sets out a series of actions to support the horticultural growers who are dependent on peat as a growing medium. <\/p><p>The commissioning of an independent expert to work with all peat suppliers to ascertain the level of horticultural peat stocks available to growers is one of the key actions in that working paper. <\/p><p>A second key action that I announced was the commissioning of experts to provide guidance on planning to assist those wishing to achieve regulatory compliance for the extraction of peat to ensure the medium term access to peat for horticulture growers.

Both sectors also saw an increase in the value of exports.<\/p>  <p>  For beef, the total annual slaughter figure at the end of 2021 was 1.66 million head which represents a 5% decrease on 2020 levels of 1.75 million head.  This was in line with the projection of tightening supplies at the start of year. The average 2021 R3 Steer price of 407.95c\/kg was 12.5% above the 2020 average price of 362.71c\/kg.<\/p>  <p>  CSO data to the end of November 2021 shows an increase in value of beef exports by 5.7% (compared to the same period in 2020) to &euro;2.1 billion in spite of a reduction in volume of 11.7% in the same period. This growth was underpinned by sustained strong demand in the UK and the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  Teagasc forecast that EU beef supply will decline in 2022 and that UK supply will remain unchanged.  The outlook for Irish beef exports to EU27 and the UK remains generally positive for 2022 according to Bord Bia. Global market demand seems set to remain good as global supplies look to be tight as result of pressure on output from both North and South America.<\/p>  <p>  For sheep, total slaughtering for 2021 was 5% down on 2020 at 2,720,467 head.  The average 2021 price of 664.49c\/kg was 28% above the 2020 average price of 519.27c\/kg. Tighter global and EU supplies of sheepmeat, combined with firm demand, resulted in a positive market for Irish sheep\u00admeat during 2021. According to CSO data, the value of sheepmeat exports increased strongly for the second consecutive year, rising by 7.4% (compared to the same period in 2020)  in the period up to the end of November to reach &euro;347 million. This was despite a drop of 9.8% in export volumes over the same period. <\/p>  <p>  The reduced availability of imported sheepmeat on the EU market, due to a reduction in UK production, had a positive impact on the demand and opportunities for Irish sheepmeat. Tighter global supplies of sheep\u00admeat and the redistribution of global supplies have helped drive higher export values for Irish exporters and these trends seem set to continue in 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  For the pig sector, 2021 saw an increase in throughput levels on 2020 of 3%, with the total pigs slaughtered for the year, coming in at just over 3.6 million head (3,615,320).  Over the past five year period there has been growth of 11.5% in production, equalling 374,138 pigs. According to data supplied by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as of November 2021 YTD there has been an increase of 4.8% in exports over 2020 in value terms (+&euro;38.8m) and an increase of 5.7% in volume, coming in at an estimated &euro;845.7 million and 264,869 tonnes respectively.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the average price for 2021 is 8.7% lower than 2020. While prices were at a historical high coming into 2020, the average 2021 price is marginally lower than that of the 5-year average price of 157.51 &euro;\/100kg.

The Plan sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to create the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile and by supporting people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy. The Plan commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework and architecture to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment through opportunities to reskill and upskill.  Accelerating the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling opportunities and increased activation will be pursued through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. <\/p><p>SMEs account for over two thirds of total employment, and as such a strong focus on indigenous SMEs is critical to a jobs-led recovery. The Economic Recovery Plan sets out a two-pronged recovery approach; a focus on domestic SMEs, whilst leveraging and reinforcing the enormous strength and resilience of the Foreign Direct Investment sector in Ireland and its indispensable contribution to job creation and communities across the country. Under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund, &euro;115 million is being invested in projects to strengthen regional enterprise in all regions and the IDA Ireland will continue to roll-out its regional property programme under its new Strategy, specifically targeting 400 investments to advance regional development.<\/p><p>The Deputy is also aware of the ambition contained in our new National Development Plan, launched at the start of October 2021, which provides substantial investment in the resilience and dynamism of our enterprises, addressing immediate challenges like the &lsquo;tail&rsquo; impacts of Brexit and COVID-19, while also preparing enterprises for the longer-term, including climate change and digitalisation. <\/p><p>The twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes will profoundly alter the economy. Embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and will support significant job creation.  Substantial capital investment under the revised National Development Plan and Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) under the European Recovery and Resilience Facility, with &euro;915 million in first tranche of funding, will be key enablers of balanced regional development, and supporting the digital and green transition.<\/p><p>The enterprise programmes of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will continue to strengthen growth and employment potential with a particular focus on balanced regional development and smart specialisation, building competitive and innovative regions and enterprises. This includes funding to back collaborative actions at regional and local level, driven by the Regional Enterprise Plans, aided through the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, the Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme, and leveraging European Regional Development Funding and other strategic investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000067#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000067#WRM04100"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[7332\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000067#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which Ireland continues to remain an attractive location for foreign direct investment in both the manufacturing and services sectors; the countries inside or outside the European Union with which Ireland is in direct competition in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>Ireland will continue to remain an attractive location for FDI in both the manufacturing and services sectors. <\/p>  <p>  During 2021 IDA Ireland won 249 FDI investments, 104 of which were new name investments.

The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy. However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.<\/p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review.<\/p>  <p>  Each review take accounts of research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SOLAS) and the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), a public consultation process, input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment, and  Ireland was one of the few countries which has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  My Department has issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 at the end of January 2022, which is now stabilising.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.  <\/p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other non-standard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises the impact delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has developed a plan of action to reduce processing times built up over the pandemic. My Department has approved a trebling of staff in the employment permits section in order to deal with the increase in applications. <\/p>  <p>  As the plan to deal with this issue is implemented and begins to take effect, we expect to see improvements shortly, with the backlog considerably reduced by the end of Q1 and substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.  My Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.  This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.<\/p>  <p>  The Department provides regular updates on its website in relation to processing times and engages directly with key stakeholders including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies, as required.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants can keep track of Employment Permit applications current processing dates at enterprise.gov.ie\/en\/What-We-Do\/Workplace-and-Skills\/Employment-Permits\/Current-Application-Processing-Dates<\/p>  <p>  The Management Board of my Department is overseeing the implementation of the plan of action and its impact on the backlog and waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  The administration and processing of Visas is a matter for the Department of Justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000067#WRM04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":550,"content":"<p>Question No. 202 answered with Question No. 201.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Minimum Wage","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000067#WRM04900"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[7362\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000067#WRM05000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will increase the minimum wage in view of the severe pressures on low-income workers at present due to rising costs of living; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":553,"content":"<p>I am aware of the pressures people are feeling as the cost of living increases. I know that many costs have increased sharply and that those on lower incomes are being disproportionately affected. <\/p>  <p>  Relevant Government Departments have been tasked with developing proposals for a package to help families with the cost of living and my Government plans to finalise this package shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the minimum wage, since its establishment in 2015, the Low Pay Commission has been responsible for making annual recommendations to Government on the appropriate rate of the National Minimum Wage. <\/p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, the national minimum wage has increased from &euro;8.65 per hour to &euro;10.50 per hour between 2016 and 2022, a 21.4% increase. This compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the 6 years to December 2021. The Minimum Wage has increased substantially in real terms over recent years. <\/p>  <p>  The share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission. The share of workers on the minimum wage or less as a percentage of the total labour force has reduced from 9.3% in Q4, 2016 to 6.8% in Q4, 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission is made up of an equal number of employer representatives, employee representatives, and independent members which helps to provide a balanced view when determining an appropriate rate for the National Minimum Wage. In addition, the establishing legislation requires the Low Pay Commission to give consideration to a range of issues when arriving at a recommendation for the appropriate National Minimum Wage rate. These issues include the cost of living, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.<\/p>  <p>  When considering increases in the National Minimum Wage during a period of inflation Government must be is conscious of the need to avoid second round effects or a wage-price spiral. <\/p>  <p>  That being said, I have been clear in my commitment to improving pay and terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay. <\/p>  <p>  In 2021, I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine and make recommendations on the best approach to achieving the programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission commissioned and received a background technical research report on the concept of a living wage.

In doing so, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are also facing rising costs. We need to make sure that we proceed in a way that does not adversely affect inflation or cause jobs to be lost, either in terms of the numbers of people employed, or the numbers of hours worked.

These arrangements were subsequently enhanced in response to the public health situation, namely the extension of the enhanced rates of subsidy for a further two months (across December 2021 and January 2022) and the reopening of the scheme for certain businesses as announced on 9 and 21 December 2021 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  From 1 February 2022, for most businesses including those in the childcare sector, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware on 21 January 2022, I announced that businesses availing of EWSS that were directly impacted by the public health regulations of last December, will continue to receive the enhanced rates of subsidy for the month of February and the graduated step-down in subsidy rates will be delayed by one month with such firms continuing to receive support under the scheme until 31 May 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of EWSS there has been regular and, where necessary, detailed engagement between my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D\/CEDIY). Analysis undertaken by D\/CEDIY informed the approach taken with regard to the childcare sector. Childcare business will continue to benefit from the EWSS exemption until end April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As announced by my colleague, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman, it is intended to put in place a transition fund between May and August 2022, which early learning and childcare providers can access. From September 2022, a major new funding stream will be introduced, to support providers in meeting their operating costs in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, I am satisfied that a coherent approach has been taken as regards the exit strategy for EWSS and the introduction of the new funding stream for the childcare sector. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as has been the case to date, the Government will continue to monitor developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[7304\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of help-to-buy scheme claims that have been rejected since its inception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":665,"content":"<p>The Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is an incentive for first-time property purchasers to help with the deposit needed to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment as a home.

The support was available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to COVID restrictions as set out in the relevant legislation.  A total of 25,600 unique premises have claimed payments under the scheme amounting to &euro;724 million.<\/p><p>In addition, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS) was a further support for businesses impacted by COVID-19.

The TWSS has been replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is provided for in section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, as amended. <\/p><p>The key eligibility criteria for the TWSS were that the business was suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic, the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 1 April 2020, at the latest.<\/p><p>As regards eligibility for the EWSS, an employer must be able to demonstrate that its business has experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.  Where an eligible employer makes a payment of wages, within prescribed limits, to a qualifying employee during the scheme, the employer can claim an EWSS subsidy for that employee. <\/p><p>As I have said previously, the primary purpose of the COVID wage subsidy schemes is to ensure, as much as possible, that employers keep employees in employment, thereby maintaining the employer\/employee relationship, so that normal operations can quickly restart once the restrictions are lifted, rather than making them redundant and eligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). These emergency support schemes were developed to deal with a situation where businesses were restricted from trading due to public health guidelines and not because of any economic or other trading conditions. It was considered that the best metric to determine the impact of the public health restrictions was a decline in turnover. <\/p><p>The legislation enacted by the Oireachtas places the administration of the subsidy schemes under the care and management of Revenue, which includes ensuring that this very significant investment of public funds is properly allocated to eligible employers and businesses in line with the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy schemes, as provided for in legislation, do not include any conditions related to the payment by a company of a dividend or dividends to its shareholders. Thus, there is no impediment to employers paying dividends to its shareholders and this is a business decision for an employer to take based on its financial circumstances.  The payment of bonuses to management and owners by any employer who has received wage subsidy supports is similarly not precluded by legislation.<\/p><p>Consequently, to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s specific regarding the efforts that have been made to recover the State support from companies who paid dividends and bonuses, the fact that the legislation does not prohibit this, it would not seem reasonable or indeed practicable to retrospectively seek to recoup subsidy payments where companies complied with the legislative requirements in place in relation to the supports. <\/p><p>However, as I have said previously, if businesses who availed of the wage subsidy schemes subsequently had a strong financial year and ultimately considered that the State support was not required by them, I would strongly encourage them to consider their position. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the overwhelming majority of companies that have participated in the wage subsidy schemes did so because they genuinely believed they would need support at that point based on the effect of the pandemic on their business. The experience I have had is that employers participating in the scheme are doing so in good faith. <\/p><p>I would also note that the schemes are characterised by a high degree of compliance by beneficiary firms. I am advised that a number of employers have returned the TWSS or EWSS payments to Revenue either because they voluntarily withdrew from either scheme, found they were ineligible or their business performance was better than they expected when they entered the schemes.  In that regard, based on the latest available information to Revenue, 860 employers have refunded &euro;10.9 million in TWSS payments.  In addition, 16 employers advised Revenue they were voluntarily removing themselves from the EWSS, 9 of whom fully withdrew and repaid nearly &euro;21 million and 7 partially withdrew and repaid just over &euro;4.5 million.  A total of 402 employers have repaid in full all subsidies claimed since the EWSS began, totalling approximately &euro;52 million with an additional 3,331 making partial repayments totalling approximately &euro;54 million.<\/p><p>To date, the EWSS has helped almost 52,000 employers to keep over 710,000 employees in employment since the scheme began in September 2020.  It is highly likely that the vast majority of employers who have claimed COVID-19 wage supports have not had the wherewithal to pay dividends or bonuses during the period of the pandemic. <\/p><p>Without the support of EWSS, many businesses would simply not be in existence today and would certainly not be in a position to adapt as responsively as they have to the reopening of all sectors of our economy. The EWSS operates as a highly effective and responsive instrument. <\/p><p>We are now shifting our focus towards the phased exit from the scheme, which is commencing this month for most businesses as they transition to the reduced rates of subsidy. Those businesses that were directly impacted by the most recent public health regulations of last December, will continue to receive the enhanced rates of support for the month of February and commence the transition to the reduced rates of subsidy from 1 March 2022.  The EWSS remains in operation until 30 April 2022 for most eligible businesses and until 31 May 2022 for those eligible businesses who have been directly impacted by public health regulations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inflation Rate","counter":678,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR02600"},{"type":"question","counter":679,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[7136\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he is taking to address and alleviate the rise in inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":680,"content":"<p>Consumer price inflation picked up sharply over the second half of last year and by December was running at 5.7 per cent &ndash; the highest annual rate in more than two decades. While some moderation was evident in January, the annual rate is still 5.0 per cent. Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position. In the euro area, the annual inflation rate reached a record high of 5.1 per cent in January, while inflation rates of 7 and 5.4 per cent were recorded in the US and UK in December.<\/p><p>At the time of <i>Budget 2022<\/i>, my Department forecast headline inflation of 2&frac14; per cent for this year. Due to energy price spikes in the fourth quarter last year, there will be upside to this projection, with inflation of around 4 per cent now more likely. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to ease over the course of the year as some of the temporary drivers of inflation fade, demand eases and supply begins to catch up.  <\/p><p>The Government is very conscious of the cost pressures facing households and accordingly introduced a large range of measures to protect households from the rising cost of living as part of <i>Budget 2022<\/i>. These measures cover a range of costs to people including health costs, income supports, family and child costs, energy costs, and supports for the costs of housing and education. Specifically, the fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week and there were increases in the allocation of Early Learning Care and School-Age Childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise. The Budget package also included a personal income tax package worth &euro;520m and a social welfare package of over &euro;550m. On foot of significant increases in energy prices, the Cabinet further approved an <i>Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment<\/i>of up to &euro;100 to be made this year to an estimated 2.1m domestic electricity account holders. <\/p><p>In addition, the Government is currently considering further measures to help alleviate some of the cost pressures facing households. When considering the policy response it is important to bear in mind that household balance sheets, on aggregate, are in a very strong position, in large part due to the supports provided to households by government throughout the pandemic. In contrast, the government balance sheet is in a less favourable position, with a debt-GNI* ratio of 106 per cent recorded at the end of last year. We must also be very careful not to generate second round effects &ndash; pouring more money into the economy could generate further inflation and be self-defeating. <\/p><p>Furthermore, the era of cheap money is now coming to an end. The higher inflation environment has brought about an earlier than expected change in the monetary policy cycle. The Bank of England increased interest rates again last week and the US Federal Reserve is expected to begin &lsquo;lift-off&rsquo; next month. In the euro area, market participants are now pricing in two interest rate increases this year; these come on top of the ending of the <i>Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme<\/i>next month. The net effect of this monetary policy shift is expected to be a higher cost of sovereign borrowing. In light of these considerations, any further support provided should be temporary and targeted.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR02900"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[7204\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider increasing the &euro;3.20 per day work from home allowance given the rise in the cost of electricity and utility bills; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[7205\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000071#WRR03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider increasing the 30% remote working relief on the cost of electricity bills given the rise in the cost of electricity and utility bills; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":684,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of administrative and legislative provisions under which employers can support employees in working from home.<\/p>  <p>  Where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC.   There is no legal obligation on the employer to make such payment and the payment is at the discretion of the employer. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental. These Benefit-in-Kind exemptions are provided for by way of legislation, in section 118 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion to increase the daily &euro;3.20 allowance, it should be noted that the administration of the tax code is exclusively a matter for Revenue.  Section 101 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has specifically provided that Revenue is independent in the performance of its functions under, or for the purposes of, tax laws.  Consequently, I am precluded from giving any direction or instruction to Revenue in regard to the review of any threshold relating to e-working.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the value of relief allowed under the administrative arrangements is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers.  The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally: at &euro;3.20 per day, up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum may be paid tax free.  In contrast, in the UK, the weekly rate is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum.  However, while Revenue has confirmed that there are currently no plans to increase the &euro;3.20 allowance, it will keep the matter under review.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in the Finance Act 2021, I enhanced and formalised the tax arrangements for working from home in line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working.  Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. <\/p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure will provide some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home and it will support living standards as the economy recovers.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2022 included a significant tax package amounting to a cost of &euro;520 million.    This included a substantial income tax package comprising of an increase of &euro;50 in each of the main tax credits &ndash; personal tax credit, employee tax credit and the earned income credit &ndash; from &euro;1,650 to &euro;1,700.  An increase of &euro;1,500 in the income tax standard rate band for all income earners was also introduced. Furthermore, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC was also increased for 2022 in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 will remain outside the top rates of USC.

Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). The BILS provides low-cost loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses. <\/p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 6.9% year on year to end September 2021.

The VAT Directive obliges each Member State to have a standard rate of VAT and also allows that a Member State may choose to have no more than two reduced rates of VAT, which may be no less than 5%, and which may be applied to certain goods and services:  any of those listed in Annex III of the Directive. Within this framework, Ireland currently applies a standard rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%.<\/p><p>The EU Directive permits derogations from the general rules to allow an individual Member State to continue certain historic tax treatments, such as the application of one of their reduced rates to particular goods and services which are not included in Annex III.  Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive and by way of special derogation from the general rule, maintains several &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; provisions and derogations that allow us to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies for historical reasons. It is on this basis that Ireland applies its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel, gas, oil, and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use. The current 13.5% VAT rate applied to energy products is a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo;, governed by Article 118 of the VAT Directive and standstill provisions from 1991 and cannot be reduced below 12%.<\/p><p>Article 102 of the VAT Directive provides that, after consultation with the EU VAT Committee, a Member State may choose to apply a reduced rate (no less than 5%) to the supply of natural gas, electricity, or district heating on a temporary basis.  The EU Commission recently indicated that this provision could now be used by Member States without the requirement to consult the VAT Committee in advance.<\/p><p>Under its existing provisions, Ireland already applies a reduced VAT rate to a broader range of energy products (including the supply of fuel, gas, oil and electricity services) than would be allowed under Article 102, which is restricted only to supplies of natural gas, electricity, district heating.<\/p><p>Because a Member State may only have a maximum of two reduced rates, if Ireland were to consider introducing a new reduced rate, even on a temporary basis, for the supply of natural gas, electricity and district heating as allowed under Article 102 of the Directive, then it would not be permissible to also continue both of our existing reduced rates of 9% and 13.5%.  This would mean that one of those existing rates would have to be removed and the goods and services covered by those rates would have to move either to one of the other reduced rates or to the standard rate.  However, there is a significant restriction on this, as the services to which the 13.5% reduced rate applies on a historic basis (i.e. the &ldquo;parked&rdquo; services) cannot be moved to a rate below 12%.  Therefore, depending on the reduced rates chosen, this restriction could mean that the services that are currently at the &lsquo;parked  rate&rsquo;, would have to move to the standard rate of 23%.<\/p><p>If Ireland did reduce the rate below 12%, even on a temporary basis, we would not be able to retain the derogation we currently hold that allows us to apply a reduced rate.  This means that the VAT rate on electricity, gas, oil and fuel would increase to 23% when the temporary relief had expired.  <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that traders are not required to identify the VAT yield generated from the supply of specific services on their VAT returns.

In that regard, in 2015 Ireland ratified the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. Since 2017, our unique practices of Uilleann Piping, Hurling and Irish Harping have been recognised by UNESCO and inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. In December 2021, Falconry in Ireland joined 23 other countries as part of a multinational inscription to the UNESCO Representative List. My Department has also developed a National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage where 38 practices have been inscribed. This work by my Department, in close cooperation with the communities concerned and with international partners, strengthens awareness raising and supports the safeguarding of our rich and diverse cultural heritage. More information on the National Inventory and practices can be found here nationalinventoryich.chg.gov.ie\/. <\/p><p><b>Target 12.b - Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism which creates jobs, promotes local culture and products.<\/b><\/p><p>The Government's Tourism Policy Statement has been implemented by way of two Tourism Action Plans, initially from 2016-2018 and latterly from 2019-2021. The implementation of the most recent Action Plan was interrupted by the need to respond to the devastating impact the COVID-19 crisis has wrought on the Irish tourism sector.<\/p><p>However, this Action Plan contained an action providing for the establishment of a working group to review international best practice in sustainable tourism and to propose guiding principles for sustainable tourism development in Ireland. The Sustainable Tourism Working Group completed its work on this action in late 2019 and its report was subsequently published and is available at www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/fff4eb-sustainable-working-group-report\/. The report set out the ambition that &ldquo;Ireland will seek to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices&rdquo; and it also set out accompanying Guiding Principles for Sustainable Tourism Development in Ireland.<\/p><p>Late last year I brought a report to Government, developed by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group, which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices out to 2023. The successful implementation of the actions identified in this interim action plan will establish new research methods, which will increase the level of evidence available, and form a clear narrative for communicating about the sustainability agenda to build a better understanding and awareness among tourism stakeholders and the general public. It will also ensure that sustainability is taken into account in policy development, business planning by the tourism agencies and industry as well as in destination management and promotional activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000073#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":753,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":754,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[7390\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of electric vehicle charging points that are available for use by staff across all carparks provided for use by her Department throughout the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":755,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in general, matters relating to property for my Department are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  <\/p>  <p>  At present, two electric vehicle charging points are provided at the Department's offices in Kildare street, which are shared with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

The Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 targeted rates waivers are separate, standalone schemes and in recognition of the resources available, many businesses that benefited from previous waivers are no longer eligible.  There are no current plans to revisit or extend the scope of the waiver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":762,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01025"},{"type":"question","counter":763,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[7157\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01050","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there is flexibility in the income limits for social housing applications in a situation (details supplied) in which a single parent with three children, full-time frontline worker in the National Ambulance Service all through the pandemic has received a 33% rent increase and is now at risk of homelessness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":764,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":765,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[7184\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if audits and checks have been carried out in relation to housing grants given to a local authority (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":767,"content":"<p>The function of the Local Government Audit Service is to complete the audits of all local authorities annual financial statements, including that of Mayo County Council, using a structured audit methodology in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice and related guidelines.

Local authorities have been advised that design-build rapid delivery approaches should be adopted where appropriate to deliver social housing projects on local authority-owned land. All new dwellings (including prefabricated and modular build units) must comply with the building regulations and building control requirements and for social housing achieve a 60-year durability for all key elements.<\/p>  <p>  To support delivery, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) put in place a framework of design-build contractors in 2017. This framework which expired in February 2021, was available for all local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to use in the interest of accelerated delivery.  While some local authorities have progressed projects using the framework, the scope of works was generally limited to certain development sizes and unit types. On this basis, other local authorities have implemented their own frameworks, while some have tendered on individual projects for design-build contractors, on a case by case basis. Details relating to individual contractors can be obtained from the OGP website at the following link: <\/p>  <p>  irl.eu-supply.com\/ctm\/Supplier\/PublicTenders\/ViewNotice\/188926 or the relevant local authority. The Housing Delivery and Co-ordination Office and my Department are currently working with the local government sector on replacement frameworks which will operate on a regional basis and cater to a variety of development sizes and unit types, including apartments. <\/p>  <p>  For the purpose of tracking social housing delivery, a Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) is published each quarter by my Department. This provides details of the individual social housing build projects, including design-build schemes, in the programme of each local authority. The most recent CSR publication covers the period up to the end of Quarter 3 of 2021, and is available at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/feea9-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q3-2021\/.  Since 2017, 752 units have been delivered under the Programme to Q3 2021, while there are projects in the pipeline that will deliver in excess of 1,370 units out to 2025. <\/p>  <p>  Many of the issues around delivery that non-prefabricated social housing construction projects face, are also faced by design-build projects, such as preparing sites, services\/access to the site, community consultation, planning, etc.  There can, however, be savings in terms of programme and construction time with these advantages growing as more use is made of these frameworks and as contractors gain more experience in implementing these methods. Under this mechanism, acceleration is delivered both by the use of the design-build services of specialist contractors and reduced construction time periods due to considerable off site fabrication. As well as off-site construction providing many benefits in terms of delivery and affordability, the new frameworks will provide sustainable and durable quality housing. <\/p>  <p>  Housing for All commits that the State will increase funding for residential construction related innovation and productivity. It will work with industry to strengthen the residential construction supply chain and to introduce modern methods of construction.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, supported by my Department, will promote a culture of innovation in residential construction. This will be achieved through, inter alia:<\/p>  <p>  - Development of Modern Methods of Construction (MMC).<\/p>  <p>  - Establishment of a Centre of Excellence Demonstration Park for MMC.<\/p>  <p>  - Publication of exemplar case studies of MMC developments.<\/p>  <p>  - Development of design for manufacture guidance for industry so that dwellings are suitable for MMC. <\/p>  <p>  and<\/p>  <p>  - Creation of a Government construction website to promote initiatives in construction.<\/p>  <p>  This work will be underpinned by the development of Key Performance Indicators for MMC and Cost of Construction, which will be reported on quarterly. The public sector will continue to provide exemplar projects to help with the capacity building process through public tenders for innovations such as rapid delivery housing and design and development of low-carbon buildings and will support enterprises to reduce cost of materials in construction. Initiatives such as standardised design to better facilitate MMC at scale and lean construction management education will be rolled out.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with local authorities to maximise delivery and harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units, including through design-build schemes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01700"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[7217\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to difficulties being experienced by homeowners and landowners in rural areas being charged between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000 for water connections to homes and lands by Irish Water, charges which are out of reach for homeowners and farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[7218\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000074#WRU01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will advise on recent increases in charges by Irish Water; if he engages with Irish Water on these charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 277 together.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.

The Expressions of Interest submitted are currently being assessed by the LDA with their priority focus and engagement being on schemes with potential delivery in 2022 and 2023. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000075#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation","counter":813,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000075#WRV00800"},{"type":"question","counter":814,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[7305\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000075#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of Housing First tenancies due to be delivered in each of the years 2022 to 2026; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":815,"content":"<p>Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies.<\/p><p>The first National Implementation Plan for Housing First, published in September 2018, which put the programme on a national footing, was designed to provide this response, by delivering permanent housing solutions and associated supports for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation.

Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.<\/p><p>2.  Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:<\/p><p>-Identification and description of defect,<\/p><p>-Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,<\/p><p>-Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,<\/p><p>-Severity\/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,<\/p><p>-Period of construction affected,<\/p><p>-Type of dwelling affected,<\/p><p>-Location of dwellings affected.<\/p><p>3.  Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.<\/p><p>4.  Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.<\/p><p>-In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.<\/p><p>5.  Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:<\/p><p>-Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,<\/p><p>-Efficient means of carrying out work,<\/p><p>-individual dwellings or whole building approach,<\/p><p>-routine maintenance\/refurbishment or remediation,<\/p><p>-Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.<\/p><p>6.  Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.<\/p><p>7.  Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.<\/p><p>8.  Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.<\/p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the first round of stakeholder consultation commenced in July 2021 with more detailed follow up and additional stakeholder consultations ongoing at present.

It is intended that the draft Plan will be made available shortly and form the basis of discussion at the next SDG National Stakeholder Forum.

While the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications has lead responsibility for promoting and overseeing the coherent implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the whole-of-Government approach to implementation of the SDGs means all Ministers are responsible for implementing the SDGs related to their functions. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Defence, I retain responsibility for implementing the individual SDGs relating to issues under the aegis of the Department of Defence.  My Department works with other stakeholder Departments' to ensure a coordinated whole-of-Government approach to implementation of the Goals, both domestically and internationally is achieved.  A number of the issues that are relevant to the performance of the functions of the Department of Defence are reflected in our Statement of Strategy 2021-2023. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are committed to promoting equality in all aspects of their work.  This is set out in the Defence Forces Equality Policy, which commits to ensuring that the principles of equality are adhered to in all its employment policies, procedures, instructions and regulations.  This ongoing commitment is also exemplified in the Defence Forces Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with such policies and commitments a number of initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female recruitment and participation in the Defence Forces, which include the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment within the general recruitment framework, including a Female Recruitment Standing Committee reporting on initiatives for 2022, with dedicated female recruitment teams proposed.  In addition, a female specific \"Always on\" (constant targeting of the female demographic) campaign commenced in October 2021. <\/p>  <p>  - The Defence Forces actively engage with schools to conduct career talks and regularly attend events aimed at future career choices for schools. <\/p>  <p>  - A Gender, Equality and Diversity Officer has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.  Gender Advisors are available to all Brigades and Services and trained Gender Focal Points are deployed with all overseas units and ships in order to promote a gender perspective in operations. <\/p>  <p>  - A Defence Forces Women's Network was established with the aim of increasing the participation of female personnel at all levels of the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  Over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence 2015, further projects will be progressed to ensure the development and promotion of strategies that continue to support increased female participation in the Defence Forces.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains an ambitious range of commitments concerning Defence that my Department will continue to implement over the lifetime of the Programme including;<\/p>  <p>  - The establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces which published its report on the 9th February.<\/p>  <p>  - Support for the establishment of centres for retired members of the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  - Development of a new Institute for Peace Support and Leadership Training in the Curragh. <\/p>  <p>  - To ensure that all enlisted members of the Defence Forces have the same access to health care as officers currently do. <\/p>  <p>  - Amend the Organisation of Working Time Act, bringing the Defence Forces within the scope of its provisions.<\/p>  <p>  A range of services are provided to veterans based on a process of regular engagement.

This funding is in addition to &euro;300,000 previously secured for both organisations across the period 2020&ndash;2022.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2022, I announced the immediate establishment of a judge-lead Independent Review into dignity and equality issues in the Defence Forces.  The Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Sean Clancy and Secretary General of the Department of Defence, Jacqui McCrum have both welcomed the Review and confirmed their full support and co-operation with this process. <\/p>  <p>  In February 2022,  the Commission on the Defence Forces completed their report.  The Commission have undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference.  Their recommendations will require careful consideration, prior to the preparation of a plan of action for Government consideration.  The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  This work will continue alongside the on-going work of White Paper implementation projects, the High Level Implementation Plan arising from the Public Service Pay Commission Report on the Defence Forces,  the Equipment Development Plan and the Infrastructure Development plan, both five year rolling plans published in 2020, and all the other work being undertaken by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to ensure the Defence Organisation can fulfil all roles as set out by Government. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs is a key strategic partner with the Defence Organisation with whom we will continue to have a close and effective working relationship in the areas of UN Peacekeeping; international security policy; disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control; and sustainable development.

My Department has responsibility for leading implementation of the following:<\/p><p><b>1. National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) (SDG 4.7) <\/b><\/p><p>Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is both an SDG target in itself and acknowledged as a key enabler for achieving all 17 SDGs.  <\/p><p>The Department together with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are currently in the process of developing a second National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) to 2030.<\/p><p>ESD to 2030 will be built on the UNESCO framework for ESD for 2030 and will be built on the five pillars set out therein, i.e. policy alignment, transforming learning environments, capacity building, empowering and mobilising youth and community engagement.  A joint public consultation has been conducted and the results will inform the direction of ESD to 2030 which will also have an accompanying implementation plan for 2022 to 2026.<\/p><p>Under the first ESD strategy 2014 &ndash; 2020, significant work was done integrating ESD themes and principles into the curriculum at all levels, into the assessment and inspection processes and into Initial teacher education and continuing professional development.

Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) (SDG 4.5) <\/b><\/p><p>DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools is the main policy initiative of my Department to address educational disadvantage at school level.  In the 2021\/22 academic year there are 884 schools in the DEIS Programme - 687 Primary and 197 Post Primary, serving over 180,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. The total Department spend on DEIS in 2021 was over &euro;150 million, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). The DEIS programme provides for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports and priority access to Continuing Professional Development. <\/p><p>Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme (DEIS Identification Model) , providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 (&euro;32 million over a full year) which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the DEIS programme to further schools. This means that by 2023 the Department of Education will target over &euro;180 million at addressing educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme, an increase of 20% on the 2021 allocation. This package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The refined DEIS Identification model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index. It is important to note that there is no application process for the DEIS programme and all schools will be considered under the refined DEIS model when it is applied.In advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model, there will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application. <\/p><p><b>3. STEM Education Policy Statement 2017-2026 (SDG 4.5) <\/b><\/p><p>A Review of Literature to Identify a Set of Effective Interventions for Addressing Gender Balance in STEM in Early Years, Primary and Post-Primary Education Settings was published in November 2020. The report sets out what is known about critical barriers to girls&rsquo; participation in STEM education and STEM learning, while also highlighting effective interventions to increase participation of girls in STEM. Development of a set of recommendations to guide national actions in relation to gender balance in STEM have been developed  and will be published shortly. Development of the second STEM Education implementation Plan 2022-2026 is underway to include public consultation and targeted education stakeholder\/partners consultations. The outputs from the consultation process along with the Gender balance in STEM recommendations and STEM and the Arts recommendations that are being developed at present will inform the new implementation plan. The Implementation Plan is expected to be ready for publication by the end of Q2 2022.<\/p><p><b>4. Literacy and Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy (SDG 4.6) <\/b><\/p><p>The Literacy and Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy 2011-2020 has now expired.  Development of a follow on strategy is underway with research commissioned to include the identification of achievements, gaps, best practice and possible areas for action for the new 10 year strategy.  This research is due to be finalised and with the Department of Education in the coming weeks.  This will inform stakeholder engagement and public consultation which will also feed into the development of the new strategy.<\/p><p><b>5. Review of the School Transport Scheme  (SDG 4.a ) <\/b><\/p><p>My Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, with a view to ensuring that it serves students and their families appropriately. The review will build upon the commitments within the Programme for Government as they relate to school transport and includes for an examination of options to reduce car journeys, commitments in respect of climate action and the potential of the School Transport Scheme to support broader government aims of promoting sustainability in transport.  The review is also examining promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school , including assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme which is funded by the Department of Transport and operated by Green-schools in partnership with the National Transport Authority and the local authorities.<\/p><p>Following commencement of this review, the Steering Group presented the Minister with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, the Minister approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures in the current school year for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  <\/p><p>Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway. As part of this phase of the review, the Department is currently conducting an extensive stakeholder engagement process. The Department is inviting stakeholders to share their views and opinions so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. <\/p><p><b><\/b>This work also contributes to SDG 13 - Climate Action and to Ireland's Climate Action Pan.<\/p><p><b>6. Schools Energy retrofit Pathfinder Programme (SDG 4.a )<\/b><\/p><p>My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. <\/p><p>Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.<\/p><p>All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).<\/p><p>In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs and not just applied for the sake of having a renewable tag on a school. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.<\/p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.<\/p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  <\/p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.<\/p><p>This work also contributes to SDG 13 - Climate Action and to Ireland's Climate Action Pan.<\/p><p><b>7.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p>  <p>  Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) play a huge role in helping to ensure the inclusion of pupils with significant care needs in education and in school life.  This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  A core recommendation of the NCSE review concerned a change in the way that SNAs are allocated to mainstream classes in both primary and post primary schools and called for the greater proportion of SNAs in these classes to be allocated on the basis of an educational profile of each school before the commencement of the school year in a similar manner to the allocation of special education teachers (SETs).<\/p>  <p>  The new frontloaded model for allocating SNA posts is intended to ensure that SNA support is available immediately to students upon their arrival, reducing delays in accessing support.<\/p>  <p>  Frontloading SNA support eliminates the need for an individual assessment for each student, ending the link with the requirement for a formal diagnosis to gain access to support, and will reduce the delays in making supports available to schools. <\/p>  <p>  This enables a school to allocate SNA support to a pupils without a formal diagnosed special educational need, but who need support. <\/p>  <p>  It had been planned that the frontloaded model of allocation for SNAs would be rolled out to all schools from the commencement of the 2020\/21 school year.  However, in light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools has been deferred to the beginning of the 2022\/23 school year. <\/p>  <p>  In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021\/22 school year: <\/p>  <p>  - Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021\/22 school year. No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021\/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. <\/p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.<\/p>  <p>  The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie\/for-schools<\/p>  <p>  Where a school is dissatisfied with how their exceptional review has been processed or is dissatisfied with the outcome of their exceptional review they can appeal.

As CE is a working age activation scheme, funding is provided on the basis that participants and supervisors on the schemes are of working age.  As a consequence, funding for CE supervisors (and participants) ceases when the person reaches State Pension age.

My Department has lead and stakeholder responsibility for several targets, focusing on the areas of social protection poverty and inequality and employment activation.<\/p>  <p>  Social transfers have an important role in reducing poverty and inequality. In this area, my Department has lead or stakeholder responsibility for Sustainable Development Goal targets 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 10.1 and 10.4. Budgets 2018 through 2022 have all been progressive, with a strong emphasis on supporting the most vulnerable. Most recently Budget 2022 included:<\/p>  <p>  - across-the-board increases of &euro;5 to all weekly payments, with proportionate increases for qualified adults; <\/p>  <p>  - increases to qualified child dependant payments, with the weekly rate for children aged 12 increasing to &euro;48 and the weekly rate for children up to age 12 to &euro;40; <\/p>  <p>  - an increase of &euro;10 per week to the weekly income threshold for Working Family Payment regardless of family size and <\/p>  <p>  - an increase to the weekly Living Allowance to &euro;22.<\/p>  <p>  Progress in this area will be delivered through implementation of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, for which I chair the steering group, among other Government strategies.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, my Department also has lead or stakeholder responsibility for targets 4.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.b, which focus on training and labour market activation. Last July, my Department published Pathways to Work 2021-2025, Ireland's national employment services strategy, which aims to help people prepare for, secure and sustain employment.   The implementation of this Strategy will make a significant contribution to achieving targets 4.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.b.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also contributes to target 5.4 through supporting carers. Recent Budgets have included: an increase in the number of hours that a carer can work or study every week outside the home and still get Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from 15 hours to 18.5 hours; an increase in the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant to &euro;1,850 per year; an increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 per week for single carers and to &euro;750 per week for carers with a spouse\/partner, and an increase in the disregard when assessing Carer&rsquo;s Allowance Capital\/Savings from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department&rsquo;s provision of the Fuel Allowance supports the delivery of Target 7.1. Since the beginning of April 2018, the Fuel Allowance season has been extended to 28 weeks.  Budget 2022 increased the weekly rate to &euro;33, increased the income threshold from &euro;100 to &euro;120 and reduced the qualification period for people in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance or Supplementary Welfare Allowance from 15 months to 12 months.

Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars: Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:<\/p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  (2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p>  <p>  In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  My Department funds 30 City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) to act as its local agent in the delivery of the national early education and childcare programmes and the implementation of Government policy. The CCCs were assigned by the National Childcare Strategy (2000) as the key local component in the development of a co-ordinated approach to quality childcare and to advance the provision of childcare facilities in their local areas.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the CCCs is to provide support and guidance to local service providers and parents in relation to the various childcare programmes, and support quality in keeping with national frameworks and policy objectives. CCCs are often the first port of call for both parents and childcare providers when trying to access early learning and care and school-age childcare initiatives. CCCs are therefore a key component in the suite of supports made available by my Department to the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education Guidelines on the use of School Buildings Outside of School Hours, see assets.gov.ie\/24484\/ca5b1787db1b47f98de31f57e977dad0.pdf relate to the use of school facilities mainly for outside of school hours but which includes pre-schools. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000079#WRZ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sustainable Development Goals","counter":1019,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000079#WRZ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1020,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[7273\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000079#WRZ03600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the progress made by his Department in respect of its targets and goals set out in Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development under the policy remit of his Department; if these targets and goals will be met by their respective deadlines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1021,"content":"<p>My Department is currently collating the information requested and a reply will issue directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000079#WRZ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence","counter":1022,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000079#WRZ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1023,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[7297\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000079#WRZ03900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"when a refuge centre for victims of domestic abuse will be established in counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1024,"content":"<p>The response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) is a cross Departmental and multi-Agency issue coordinated by the Department of Justice.

The plan is being developed collaboratively between my Department and the Higher Education Authority.<\/p><p>The plan has involved significant consultation with interested stakeholders, including higher education institutions, students, individuals and representatives of priority groups.<\/p><p>This approach of the Plan will be rooted strongly in partnership approaches, across Government, institutions and communities.  It will focus on improving the learning experience and success of learners and seek to enhance support for people who are under-represented in the learner population in higher education.

Work is continuing across the sector to enhance the inclusivity, accessibility and flexibility of FET provision.  Within their annual service planning processes, the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) consider the needs of the most marginalised groups and how these are being addressed within their provision.  In the area of fostering inclusion, there have been two significant developments, namely the development of the <i>Framework for Universal Design for Learning in FET<\/i>and the launch of the new 10 year adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy<i>, Adult Literacy for Life<\/i>.  Both developments are significant and will help to enable every citizen to participate fully in society.<\/p><p>The <i>Mitigating Against Educational Disadvantage Fund (MAEDF)<\/i>aims to provide funding to support educationally disadvantage learners in accessing and participating in community education. The fund was first made available in 2020 with &euro;5.8m granted comprising over 500 community education projects funded through the 16 ETBs. In light of the great successes of the MAEDF in 2020, and in recognition of the continuing challenges in relation to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, a further &euro;6.85 million was granted under this Fund again in 2021, comprising over 1,000 initiatives. The projects funded varied from projects to help support online learning, connect communities and providing social supports to the most disadvantaged <i>eCollege<\/i>has also been expanded, and eCollege courses have been temporarily made available free of charge as additional supports to those impacted by Covid<i>-19.<\/i><\/p><p>c.<b>National Skills Strategy 2025 (SDG 4.4, 4.5)<\/b><\/p><p>- The National Skills Strategy 2016-2025 (NSS) was published in 2016 and makes recommendations in the skills arena for the period to 2025.<\/p><p>- The Strategy sets out a wide range of actions under six key objectives aimed at improving the development, supply and use of skills over the next decade. The objectives are:<\/p><p>1. Education and training providers will place a stronger focus on providing skills development opportunities that are relevant to the needs of learners, society and the economy.<\/p><p>2. Employers will participate actively in the development of skills and make effective use of skills in their organisations to improve productivity and competitiveness.<\/p><p>3. The quality of teaching and learning at all stages of education will be continually enhanced and evaluated.<\/p><p>4. People across Ireland will engage more in lifelong learning.<\/p><p>5. There will be a specific focus on active inclusion to support participation in education and training and the labour market.<\/p><p>6. We will support an increase in the supply of skills to the  labour market.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the NSS in 2016, the changes that were anticipated for the future world of work have accelerated, including those around Industry 4.0, automation and digitisation. The new technologies and new skills associated with these trends bring with them requirements in relation to upskilling and reskilling for those in employment and those seeking employment, as well as requirements in relation to the content of tertiary education.  It is timely to review and revitalise the skills strategy, architecture and overarching approach for Ireland in order to ensure that our skills framework continues to be fit for purpose and to work on the basis of partnership with industry in driving forward the skills agenda and responding to the challenges that face us as our economy reopens and recovers <\/p><p>d.<b>National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (SDG 4.7)<\/b><\/p><p>The National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) 2014-2020 has now expired but significant progress was made over the period, spanning early childhood education to higher education and beyond, and a report is being compiled in this respect.  Achievements included:-<\/p><p>- the introduction of additional undergraduate and postgraduate programmes relevant to sustainable development;<\/p><p>- the integration of sustainable development criteria in initial teacher education programmes;<\/p><p>- increased participation in the Green Campus programme among higher education institutions;<\/p><p>- increased pipeline of research and researchers with expertise on the SDGs and Sustainability achieved, through research funding calls  with a specific focus on these areas.<\/p><p>Building on the success of the existing strategy, the Department, together with the Department of Education are jointly developing a new strategy for ESD to 2030, aligned to the UNESCO Framework for ESD for 2030 and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 4.7. As well as being a target in itself, ESD is also considered a key enabler for achieving all 17 SDGs. A public consultation process to inform ESD to 2030 took place between April - June 2021, in addition to targeted stakeholder consultation in Autumn 2021. The new strategy will aim to extend ESD to the informal and non-formal education sectors, raise awareness, increase youth participation and links with communities.  Development will be overseen by the ESD Advisory Group. It is envisaged that a new strategy and accompanying implementation plan for ESD to 2030 will be published in Spring 2022.<\/p><p>2.<b>Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - Statement of Strategy 2021-2023<\/b><\/p><p>The SDG Implementation Plan calls for a reference in Statements of Strategy where Departments have lead responsibility to implement SDG goals.

This will enable agility and responsiveness over the full period of the strategy and a strong focus on delivery and reform.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits to creating better opportunities through education and research and ensuring that Ireland is a global leader in research and innovation across the arts, humanities, social sciences and STEM. Research and innovation will be fundamental to addressing our economic and social challenges such as climate change, digitalisation and public health and as such the new strategy will be aligned with the SDGs.<\/p><p>4.<b>Climate Action (SDG 13)<\/b><\/p><p>Climate Action features prominently in the Department&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2021-2023. The Department is also contributing actively to the preparation of the new Climate Action Plan. The research and innovation sectors will play an important role, including advancing innovative and technological solutions that will in turn be critical to enable sectors across the economy to meet the ambitious targets set for 2030 and 2050. There will also be a key role for the tertiary education sector to ensure reskilling and upskilling for climate action, including new skills required in the green transition such as retrofitting.<\/p><p>In terms of progress made, Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative (HCI) has provided significant funding for courses that include a focus on the environment, climate change and sustainability. <\/p><p>Under Springboard+ 2021, 310 places were provided on fourteen courses that focus on the environment, climate change and sustainability.

Specifically for drugs offences, FSI conducts laboratory testing and issues scientific reports for cases prosecuted under the Misuse of Drugs Act. This service is provided for Section 15 (possession with intent to supply), Section 17 (cultivation) and Section 3 (simple possession) cases as defined within the Misuse of Drugs Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with forensic Institutes in other jurisdictions, case submissions have increased in FSI over several years. Between 2018 and 2021, case submissions for Drugs and Toxicology increased by 23%. Drug submissions in 2020 were particularly high. This flows from the  focused efforts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na around the country to disrupt the supply and distribution of controlled substances. <\/p>  <p>  To manage this demand, I am advised that FSI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have established an agreed prioritisation system for forensic work and this is represented in a comprehensive Service Level Agreement. This calls on FSI to focus on the most important cases and prioritise resources accordingly. This practice is common across forensic organisations in Europe. Cases are prioritised on the basis of when the Court Date for the drugs offence is scheduled. For urgent cases (for example, where a suspect is in custody) FSI provides a verbal report within 24 hours.<\/p>  <p>  FSI has increased its drug testing capacity over the past 6 months after refurbishment of laboratory spaces and recruitment of additional staff and is systematically reducing its backlog of drugs cases based on agreed prioritisation criteria with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  To support its work the current funding allocated to the FSI increased by &euro;9.6m between 2019 and 2021, representing a very significant 79% increase in its resources.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, FSI plans to transition to a new purpose-built facility at the Backweston Science Campus in the second half of this year. This is a major capital investment, with a project cost of &euro;99.5m.   The new facility will provide best practice standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage, and will enable growth in the capability and capacity of forensic services in Ireland.   The move to the new facility is further supported by the provision of additional current funding of &euro;6.6m in 2022 allocation much of which is focused on assisting the transition process and procuring new equipment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000081#WRBB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":1098,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000081#WRBB02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Disputes","counter":1097,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000081#WRBB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1098,"qnumday":385,"qnumall":"[7316\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000081#WRBB02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address matters raised in correspondence (details supplied); his views on the planned industrial action; the rationale for his refusal to sanction new measures; the reason for instructing the HSE not to attend the Labour Court; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1099,"content":"<p>As you may be aware, the current Public Service Agreement, Building Momentum, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining.

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.<\/p>  <p>  Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.<\/p>  <p>  I remain acutely aware of the need to improve access to orthopaedic patients, particularly for those patients with acute medical needs.  On the 7th February 2022, I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss increased orthopaedic activity at CHI and additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures including Spina Bifida, by year end.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the HSE and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to deliver improved paediatric orthopaedic services. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively.<\/p>  <p>  More specifically, in order to tackle waiting lists for scoliosis, and orthopaedic paediatric surgery more broadly, an additional &euro;5 million has recently been committed to improve access, including through additional theatre and diagnostic capacity to be brought on stream this year.<\/p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland continue to examine new and innovative ways to improve access to orthopaedic services. &ldquo;Cappagh Kids&rdquo; at the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional theatre capacity for non-complex, age appropriate, orthopaedic procedures, freeing up much needed space at central CHI sites for children with complex, multi-disciplinary needs. Additional orthopaedic outpatient sessions are also now held at Cappagh, providing additional capacity to see and assess children on the outpatient waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a new fast-track orthopaedic pathway has been developed as part of outpatient reduction plans. Paediatric Active Clinical Triage has already been introduced for the longest waiters (over 12 months) on the paediatric outpatient list.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.

Information on the IEEA including registering for the assessment, assessment dates, fees and descriptions of the competencies to be assessed are provided within the Intern Application Guide Stage 1 which can be found at hbsrecruitmentservices.ie\/medical-intern-stage-1\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1179,"content":"<p>Question No. 412 answered with Question No. 396.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1181,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[7200\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that there were 641 children and young persons waiting for CAMHS services by the HSE in Cork as of December 2021; his plans to reduce this waiting list; when it is anticipated that this list will be eliminated entirely; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1182,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":1183,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1184,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[7201\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the former health centre in Doohery, County Donegal will be handed over to the community (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1185,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the management of the public healthcare property estate, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1186,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1187,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[7206\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000083#WRDD01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive surgery in Croom Hospital, Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1188,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The guidance takes account of the significant changes to national public health measures in general, whilst also recognising the need for continued vigilance in healthcare settings, including homes due to the increased vulnerability of people receiving care and\/or living in these settings. The guidance continues to recognise the importance of visiting and meaningful social contact for residents. This is a positive further step forward to a return to more normalised access and visiting for people living in nursing homes and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Key changes of note to the guidance are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -  The minimum level of visiting should normally be daily visits by up to 2 people at one time;<\/p>  <p>  -  The introduction of a &ldquo;nominated support person&rdquo;, who should normally have regular and unrestricted access to the resident in the nursing home for whom they are nominated, except if that person is a specific risk to residents (e.g. is subject to self-isolation) or there is specific public health or infection prevention and control advice to limit visitors. This will be in addition to regular visiting; <\/p>  <p>  -  Unless specifically advised by public health, at an early stage of outbreak, the nominated support person should continue to have access for some part of each day. If a resident does not have a nominated support person, visiting should generally not be less than 2 visits per week by one person during an outbreak; <\/p>  <p>  -  Limitations on visiting should be justified by an up-to-date risk assessment and should be reassessed twice each week;<\/p>  <p>  -  There should be no restrictions on movement of residents within the nursing home after going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home, unless a significant exposure risk occurred during the outing;<\/p>  <p>  -  There will no longer be a need for visitors to show immunity through vaccination or previous infection;<\/p>  <p>  -  In line with established guidance, there remains no infection prevention and control requirement to restrict window visits. <\/p>  <p>  This revised visiting guidance is yet another significant step forward in the return to more normalised access and visiting for people living in nursing homes and their families. I expect that all nursing home providers will ensure that they facilitate visiting in line with this new guidance to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  Visitors are reminded of their responsibilities with regard to self-checks for COVID-19 in advance of visits, and infection and prevention control and social interaction with others other than the resident they are visiting whilst in the nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard. Furthermore, I will write to HIQA and all nursing home providers, as I did before, to remind them of their obligations for facilitating visiting in nursing homes, in line with the updated visiting guidance, and the rights of residents to receive visitors.  <\/p>  <p>  COVID-19 is a continuing risk, especially when community transmission is high. It is appropriate that the significant infection prevention and control and public health guidance remains in place for residential care settings. The State continues to provide substantial support to aid the ongoing management of COVID-19 in these settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000084#WREE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1263,"content":"<p>Question No. 440 answered with Question No. 439.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1265,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[7396\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000085#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will establish a nursing home regulator to ensure there is proper oversight of the sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1266,"content":"<p>The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was established under the Health Act 2007. HIQA is the independent Authority established to drive continuous improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care services. The Authority comes under the aegis of the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007 also established the office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services in HIQA.  The functions of the Chief Inspector are to:<\/p>  <p>1.    establish and maintain registers of designated centres (including nursing homes);<\/p>  <p>2.    register and inspect designated centres to assess whether the provider is in compliance with the regulations and standards.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act any person carrying on the business of a residential service within a designated centre (i.e. a nursing home) can only do so if the centre is registered under the Act and the person is its registered provider. As part of the registration and onward process of regulation, the provider must satisfy the Chief Inspector that she or he is fit to provide the service and that the service is in compliance with the Act, the regulations and specified standards. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of regulation in relation to designated centres is to safeguard people who are receiving residential services. Regulation provides assurance to the public that people living in designated centres are receiving services and supports that meet the requirements of National Standards, which are underpinned by regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The Chief Inspector has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards. <\/p>  <p>  The Chief Inspector, in discharging their duties, determines through examination of all information available to them, including site inspections, whether a nursing home meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the &ldquo;COVID-19 Nursing Home Expert Panel: Examination of Measures to 2021&rdquo;, HIQA&rsquo;s paper on &ldquo;The Need for Regulatory Reform&rdquo; and learning from the pandemic, Minster Donnelly and I approved a two-phased approach to examining the legislation with a view to proposing enhancements to the primary and secondary legislation governing nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  Phase 1 will bring forward interim enhancements to the primary legislative framework to enhance governance and oversight of nursing homes. The proposals will, amongst other things, provide new and enhanced enforcement powers for the Chief Inspector; reduce timelines and processes for regulatory actions and introduce a new reporting system for the reporting and publication of key operational data to support national planning in an integrated way and improve the information available.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the reform of the regulatory framework governing nursing homes and approved the inclusion of a Health (Amendment) Bill on its legislative agenda. It is expected that, subject to Government approval, a draft General Scheme will be published in early 2022, with a Bill being developed and published thereafter.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, secondary legislation will be drafted to enhance the current regulations. A bilateral project group comprising representatives from the Department and HIQA, is supporting the legislative process.  <\/p>  <p>  A wider review of the regulatory framework, phase 2, will commence later in 2022. It will take into account a programme of longer-term strategic reform considerations arising from, inter alia, pandemic learnings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000085#WRFF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1267,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000085#WRFF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1268,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[7401\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000085#WRFF00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure the pandemic bonus payment will be paid to persons in receipt of the carer's allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1269,"content":"<p>Firstly I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the efforts of the general public, volunteers and all workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Wednesday 19 January, the Government announced a once-off public holiday will take place on Friday 18 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced COVID-19 recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to recognise their unique role during the pandemic.

I have repeatedly indicated that research and innovation will be needed over the decade in order to bring the sector into compliance with its carbon budget ceiling, a position which is very much consistent with all sectors of the economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000086#WRGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1316,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[7338\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000086#WRGG01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which imports of meat or dairy products have changed in the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1317,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[7339\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000086#WRGG01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which imports of beef, lamb, dairy or pig meat have increased or decreased into Ireland or via the European Union into Ireland over the past five years; the countries from which such imports originated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1318,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458 and 459 together.<\/p><p>Over the period 2016 to 2020 the volume of imports of beef, dairy produce and sheep meat have increased while the volume of pig meat imports has decreased. <\/p><p>The volume of beef imported increased from 29,500 tonnes in 2016 to 30,000tonnes in 2020, an increase of 2%.

I received the Report of the Seafood Task Force in October and it recommends some 16 support schemes at a cost of &euro;423 million.  These recommendations are being urgently examined across Government with regard to available funds, State Aid, eligibility under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve and the Public Spending Code.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of the Task Force recommended schemes relate to the fishing fleet and are designed to mitigate the impact of the TCA and restore the fleet to profitability.  The most significant recommendation for the fleet is of course the recommended decommissioning scheme that would reduce the whitefish fleet by 25%, so that vessels remaining in the fleet would be restored to pre-TCA levels of profitability.  Many of the remaining recommendations are designed to mitigate the impacts on coastal communities of this fleet reduction, through adding value to the reduced quotas available to Ireland, developing alternative sources of raw material supply for our processors and diversifying the coastal economy.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the measures recommended by the Task Force, my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Programme 2014-20 has been operating since 2016, supporting the sustainable development of our seafood sector.  The Programme has been providing a wide range of financial supports to fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises and to enterprises, groups and individuals in coastal communities.  These supports include for capital investment, innovation, professional advisory services and marketing.  Through these measures, the Programme has been fostering the economic development of the seafood industry and coastal communities, building value and growing exports in these enterprises.  The EMFF Programme is now coming to an end and a new Seafood Development Programme 2021-27 is being prepared by my Department, with the aim of its adoption by the European Commission by end 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to addressing the challenges facing our seafood sector following the TCA.

Irish dairy produce reached 147 markets in 2021, with destinations outside of the EU and UK exceeding 50% of all exports for the first time. CSO data shows milk production up to the end of November at 8.03bn litres, a 5.9% increase compared to 2020. The annual average milk price for 2021 is estimated to have risen by 16% to 40.6 cent per litre (vat incl. actual fat and protein).

This growth was underpinned by sustained strong demand in the UK and the EU.  Teagasc forecast that EU beef supply will decline in 2022 and that UK supply will remain unchanged.  The outlook for Irish beef exports to EU27 and the UK remains generally positive for 2022 according to Bord Bia. Global market demand seems set to remain good as global supplies look to be tight as result of pressure on output from both North and South America.<\/p><p>For sheep, total slaughtering for 2021 was 5% down on 2020 at 2,720,467 head.  The average 2021 price of 664.49c\/kg was 28% above the 2020 average price of 519.27c\/kg. Tighter global and EU supplies of sheepmeat, combined with firm demand, resulted in a positive market for Irish sheep\u00admeat during 2021. According to CSO data, the value of sheepmeat exports increased strongly for the second consecutive year, rising by 7.4% (compared to the same period in 2020)  in the period up to the end of November to reach &euro;347 million. This was despite a drop of 9.8% in export volumes over the same period. The reduced availability of imported sheepmeat on the EU market, due to a reduction in UK production, had a positive impact on the demand and opportunities for Irish sheepmeat. Tighter global supplies of sheep\u00admeat and the redistribution of global supplies have helped drive higher export values for Irish exporters and these trends seem set to continue in 2022.  <\/p><p>For the pig sector, 2021 saw an increase in throughput levels on 2020 of 3%, with the total pigs slaughtered for the year, coming in at just over 3.6 million head (3,615,320).  Over the past five year period there has been growth of 11.5% in production, equalling 374,138 pigs. According to data supplied by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as of November 2021 YTD there has been an increase of 4.8% in exports over 2020 in value terms (+&euro;38.8m) and an increase of 5.7% in volume, coming in at an estimated &euro;845.7 million and 264,869 tonnes respectively. However, the average price for 2021 is 8.7% lower than 2020. While prices were at a historical high coming into 2020, the average 2021 price is marginally lower than that of the 5-year average price of 157.51 &euro;\/100kg. This reduction in price has occurred in tandem with an increase in input costs causing serious difficulty for the sector. My officials are continuing to monitor the current market situation and are exploring all potential options available at EU and national level to assist in supporting Irish pig farmers through this significant market disturbance.<\/p><p>Irish poultry meat throughput in 2021 was slightly down on 2020 (-1.1%), coming in 110,426,601 birds slaughtered, of which 90.4% were chickens.<b><\/b>Prices for poultry meat have remained stable and prices at end of December 2021 for poultry meat were &euro;2.18 per kg, a 5c\/kg increase on the same period of 2020. As of November 2021 YTD, there is a decrease in exports of 5.2% on 2020 in value terms and 30.4% in volume coming in at &euro;208.9 million and 84,522 tonnes respectively. 2021 exports were impacted by both Avian Influenza outbreaks and COVID-19 restrictions. The outlook for poultry meats is positive on both EU and global markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000086#WRGG03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":1343,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000086#WRGG03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1344,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[7375\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000086#WRGG04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of electric vehicle charging points that are available for use by staff across all carparks provided for use by his Department throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1345,"content":"<p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has four Electric Vehicle charging points available to staff at its campus in Backweston, Co.

It is intended that the draft Plan will be made available shortly and form the basis of discussion at the next SDG National Stakeholder Forum. This will allow for a final round of input from stakeholders prior to finalisation and publication. <\/p><p>Ireland has adopted a &lsquo;whole-of-Government&rsquo; approach to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with each Minister having responsibility for implementing individual SDG targets related to their functions. My Department has made the following progress in implementing those targets:  <\/p><p><b>Our Rural Future<\/b>, a new 5-year Rural Development Policy, focusing on the sustainable social, economic and environmental development of rural Ireland was published in March 2021.

The policy reflects the Irish Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitating the success of social enterprise in Ireland, as well as underpinning the Government&rsquo;s commitments to equality, human rights and social cohesion. The policy is aligned to the SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth in particular and the targets therein.<\/p><p><b>Our Public Libraries 2022: Inspiring, Connecting and Empowering Communities aligns with SDG 4 Quality Education and specifically to targets:<\/b><\/p><p>4.2. By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education<\/p><p>4.6 By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.<\/p><p>Additionally, the<b>SuperValu TidyTowns competition<\/b>is administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development. The Sustainable Development Goals now form an integral part of the competition and the goals have been aligned to each of the eight competition categories. A specific SDG award is being introduced for 2021. A series of capacity building webinars have taken place for TidyTown Groups in 2021 including one dedicated to the SDGs. The monthly TidyTowns newsletter provides information to circa 1,000 TidyTowns groups on how they can assist in achieving these goals in their community. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000087#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":1362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000087#WRHH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1363,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[7388\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000087#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of electric vehicle charging points that are available for use by staff across all carparks provided for use by her Department throughout the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1364,"content":"<p>There are currently no electric vehicle charging points available at my Department's offices in Dublin and Ballina.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000087#WRHH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"}]
