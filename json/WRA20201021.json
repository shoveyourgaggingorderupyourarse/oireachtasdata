Budget 2021 will help companies deal with Covid-19 and provides for additional supports tailored to those sectors who are most in need.\u00a0 The new CRSS programme will provide closed or effectively closed business a payment based on their turnover up to &euro;5,000 per week. This will make a really big difference and will be paid in addition to the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.\u00a0<\/p><p>In March 2020 the Government introduced\u00a0an emergency amendment to the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 which effectively suspends an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer following certain periods of lay-off or short-time work due to Covid-19.\u00a0 The Government was concerned that the financial impact of significant redundancy claims at this time would have a serious impact on the potential for businesses, and the economy as a whole, to recover which in turn could result in significant insolvency and bankruptcy situations, with further permanent job losses. The decision to extend this emergency measure to 30th November was a difficult one.\u00a0 I know many employees who have been laid off are experiencing great uncertainty.<\/p><p>Apart from the above measure all other existing\u00a0redundancy provisions remain unchanged and in force.

With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100070#WRB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100070#WRB05700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100070#WRB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[31897\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100070#WRB05700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the OPW will provide an update on construction of a bridge over the Dodder linking Bushy Park and Rathfarnham; and if plans have been delayed due to the pandemic.","asker":"1554","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>As\u00a0Minister\u00a0for\u00a0Transport, I have\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for\u00a0policy\u00a0and overall\u00a0funding\u00a0in relation to public\u00a0transport.

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.\u00a0 Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.<\/p>  <p>  Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme. \u00a0Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.<\/p>  <p>  Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment, which will be known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo; (&ldquo;ACTE&rdquo;). The ACTE will provide an immediate cash support to businesses. The amount of the ACTE will be based on an amount equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in the case of new businesses, the average weekly turnover in 2020) up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000. <\/p>  <p>  All eligible businesses can claim the support irrespective of their turnover levels, but the amount of the ACTE cannot exceed the lower of the amount based on 10%\/5% of the relevant weekly turnover or &euro;5,000 per week.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. It is not sufficient that the trade of a business, such as a travel agency, has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, as in the case of a track bookmaker, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.\u00a0 Similarly, a business that does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, but rather provides goods and services in connection with live events and shows held across a range of venues, will also not be eligible under the scheme.\u00a0 A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support live entertainment in 2021, and existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). They may also be eligible to warehouse\u00a0VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC03400"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[31990\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if self-employed workers will be eligible for the warehousing of tax announced in budget 2021.","asker":"1485","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>In my Budget speech, I announced\u00a0that I would provide for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include the 2019 balance and 2020 preliminary tax obligations for self-assessed taxpayers .<\/p>  <p>  I specifically referred to self-employed people who have suffered a significant drop in income and will struggle to pay their 2019 balance and preliminary tax for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The details of the\u00a0expanded debt warehousing provisions will be set out in the\u00a0Finance Bill due to be published later this week.\u00a0 I can confirm that this will include arrangements \u00a0to allow self-assessed taxpayers whose income has been adversely affected by Covid-19 restrictions to defer payment for a period of a year with no interest applying; 3 per cent will apply thereafter and there will be no surcharge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":104,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 44  to 46, inclusive, answered with Question No. 42.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[31778\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the status of the planned changes to the retail export scheme including changes to the spending threshold; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1497","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[31856\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 55 together.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously outlined the rationale for the changes proposed to the VAT Retail Export Scheme. This scheme enables visitors who are resident outside the EU to benefit from VAT relief on goods purchased in Ireland and subsequently taken outside of the EU. If the scheme applies to UK visitors post-Brexit without changes UK visitors will be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses, as purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues. Due to the volume of passenger movements between the UK and Ireland, the volume of refund applications is likely to significantly increase which simultaneously heightens the risk of abuse of the Retail Export Scheme post Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, the measures in the Bill are precautionary and aim both to minimise the potential for abuse of the scheme and to reduce the possibility of diversion in retail consumption from Ireland to the UK, post Brexit.   <\/p>  <p>  The amended legislation proposed in the General Scheme of the Brexit Omnibus Bill 2020 provides for two elements to restrict the scheme. The first is a new requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.  The second is to provide that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in value in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The monetary limit will apply in respect of all third country travellers who apply for a refund under the scheme, post commencement of the relevant sections. <\/p>  <p>  The Ireland\/Northern Ireland Protocol ensures that there will be no VAT Retail Export Scheme between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Any changes to the operation of the scheme will of course be kept under review by Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC04400"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[31789\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to ensure the availability of life insurance for persons in situations in which due to a change in policy by a provider, older persons are unable to secure a new life insurance policy due to their age, such as in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>At the outset, while I have an appreciation of the difficulties individuals may find themselves in as outlined in the Deputy's question neither I, as the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.\u00a0 Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in those policies. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the specific issue that the Deputy refers to, I understand that the credit union in question has recently made some changes to their insurance\u00a0products for members. Ultimately, the provision of such insurance is a commercial matter for the credit union in question as it would be for any other financial service provider.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to life insurance, it is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance, and what terms to apply.\u00a0 These factors can include age, health, family medical history, occupation and lifestyle.\u00a0 In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.\u00a0 Furthermore, my understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and that they will price in accordance with their own past claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  In situations where a person is not satisfied that they are being treated fairly by a financial services provider, including a credit union, it is advisable that that person make a complaint to the provider's internal complaint resolution process.\u00a0 The Consumer Protection Code requires that, if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).\u00a0\u00a0 The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider and can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle\u00a0must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria\u00a0is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:<\/p>  <p>  - be\u00a0wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <\/p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that\u00a0the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; <\/p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; <\/p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the\u00a0medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance I\u00a0acknowledge that the persons who successfully challenged the\u00a0Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC are, on the basis of the Supreme Court decision, entitled to seek access to the Scheme. The Supreme Court decision raised complex issues, including the manner in which the persons concerned can access the Scheme, given that the Regulation which set out the medical eligibility criteria was not found to be invalid and given that the persons concerned were not assessed for a Primary Medical Certificate on the single criterion of being permanently and severely disabled.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the\u00a0Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the\u00a0Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to\u00a0policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will\u00a0seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p>  <p>  My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with\u00a0officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. <\/p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis, without which it is impossible to continue accepting new applicants to the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":120,"content":"<p>Question No. 51 answered with Question No. 42.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC05600"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[31846\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is engaging with banks regarding the issue that mortgage approvals are being delayed in which an applicant&rsquo;s employer is in receipt of the EWSS despite the applicant&rsquo;s wages remaining unaffected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[31906\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100071#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has held further talks with the main lender banks with regard to the provision of loans and mortgages to those in receipt of EWSS or the pandemic unemployment payment (details supplied).","asker":"1626","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 60 together.<\/p>  <p>  I have met with the CEOs of the banks on a number of occasions since the pandemic arose to discuss the measures banks and other regulated lenders can put in place to assist their borrowers who are economically impacted by COVID-19 and also the need to continue to support overall credit and lending in the economy, including new residential mortgage lending.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support employers by helping them to continue trade as they deal with risk arising from COVID-19, and this puts employers in a position to retain key staff and ensure the viability of businesses and firms.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the approach of regulated mortgage lenders on new mortgage lending, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.<\/p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm.

It is working closely with financial services firms and market participants to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for the end of the transition period on 31 December, and that they are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that, while some level of market disruption is inevitable, the financial system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand a hard Brexit and that the most material &lsquo;cliff edge&rsquo; financial stability risks arising from Brexit have been largely mitigated.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department recently worked with the ESRI on an examination of the sectoral overlap of COVID-19 and Brexit shocks, which found that there is limited overlap in the sectors exposed to the different shocks, and limited connection between the sectors exposed to each shock. In this regard, exposures to Brexit in the area of financial services should not be magnified by additional exposure to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed to include in the 2020 Brexit Omnibus Bill a number of measures which will minimise disruption. This includes measures in relation to settlement finality, and to enable UK and Gibraltar insurance undertakings and intermediaries to continue to fulfil contractual obligations to their Irish customers following the end of the transition period.<\/p>  <p>  There are fewer than 3 months left until the end of the transition period.

This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment in venues across the country, building on the Stimulus scheme announced in July.  It will also see support for activities at community level leading to greater work opportunities for artists, crew and venue workers nationwide.  There will be further supports for music, building on the significant demand for support under the July stimulus Music Scheme operated by First Music Contact.  A scheme of capital grants for equipment will also operate in 2021.  Combined with measures announced by the Minister for Finance, this will provide additional supports to a sector severely impacted by COVID-19.  It is my intention to consult with the sector in advance announcing how this funding will be used and allocated.  <\/p><p>Primary support for the arts including dance in Ireland is delivered by the Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003.  The Arts Council received an additional &euro;25 million in funding in 2020 in response to the pandemic, bringing it final 2020 allocation to &euro;105 million. Among the measures delivered as a result of the extra funding are new and additional bursaries and commissions from the Arts Council, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis.  Arts Council funding in 2020 has reached organisations and individuals never before funded by the Council. Arts Council<b><\/b>funding for 2021 is up &euro;50m from its initial 2020 allocation to &euro;130m.  This additional investment will empower the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts organisations come through this crisis and play their part in the national recovery.  It will ensure that events of the highest quality across all art forms can still reach the public in new and blended ways.  This support will protect jobs and it will see thousands of artists enabled to create new work.  This year, the Arts Council is providing support to a wide range of stakeholders impacted by the pandemic.  This increase in funding will allow the Arts Council to broaden its reach further and in particular to reach out to workers in the sector, especially those who would not previously have been beneficiaries of support from the Arts Council.  <\/p><p>Screen Ireland&rsquo;s<b><\/b>funding will increase by &euro;9m to &euro;30.1m in 2021. The audiovisual industry has been one of the success stories of 2020, with on-screen success in the form of <i>Normal People<\/i>, but also its track record in maintaining output in the face of COVID-19.  This record allocation will further support Screen Ireland at this critical time. In addition, the extension of the Section 481 regional uplift for an additional year is an important support and will further assist growth in the industry. <\/p><p>An allocation of &euro;8m is being made to the National Concert Hall to allow for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra from RT&Eacute;.  This will be a significant step towards the objective of enabling the orchestra to be established as a world class orchestra which will, with the NCH, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that will greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public.<\/p><p>Additional capital funding will see progress in the ongoing programme of investment in our capital institutions including at the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland and the Crawford Art Gallery.  <\/p><p>The Decade of Centenaries programme with increased<b><\/b>funding to &euro;5m will allow for the appropriate commemoration of the centenary of events leading to the foundation of the State. <\/p><p>Overall, Budget 2021 comprises &euro;270m in current expenditure and &euro;60.7m in capital for the arts and culture sector.

This approach examines firstly, the 14-day cumulative incidence rate within the region, secondly, the overall level of testing in the region and finally, the testing positivity rate within the region. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) will make a weekly assessment and issue advisory maps of which regions within the EU\/EEA are green, orange or red, or, if data is unavailable, grey. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Recommendation, Member States are required to lift restrictions applying to green regions within seven days of adoption of the Recommendation.

In view of the current epidemiological situation, those arriving from orange and red zones will continue to be required to restrict their movements for fourteen days upon arrival, as will those arriving from grey regions. However, those coming from orange regions may waive the requirement to restrict their movements if they can produce a negative test result of an appropriate pre-departure test.

Demolitions and seizures of Palestinian property and humanitarian aid, including Palestinian homes, continue despite previous commitments from Israeli authorities not to target Palestinian residential structures during the Covid-19 pandemic.

It is important also, however, that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers should also be pursued. Ireland, together with a group of EU Member States, pursue this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium.

On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September\u00a0\"A\" Company came under attack.\u00a0From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was addressed in 1962 and\u00a01965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board\u00a0did not\u00a0award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: <\/p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. <\/p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. <\/p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville,\u00a0a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company was issued. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.\u00a0 This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.\u00a0 This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to enquiries about any additional medals, the award of Distinguished Service Medals (DSM) and Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) are provided for\u00a0in Defence Forces\u00a0Regulations (DFR) A9.\u00a0 This regulation also sets out the criteria for the award of such medals.\u00a0 It is important that in order to maintain the prestige of such medals and indeed all of those provided for in DFR A9, that the criteria outlined is strictly adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of any change to the regulations or to the criteria for the award of DSMs or MMGs is not a straightforward matter with many associated complexities.\u00a0 Robust consideration must be given to any potential unintended consequences arising such as maintaining the integrity of the award of medals system and implications for previous decisions of properly constituted medals boards.\u00a0\u00a0 The availability of documentary evidence\u00a0and official records also presents a challenge in this case.\u00a0 It has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award such medals will be considered.

Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p><p>Schools\u00a0may\u00a0apply\u00a0to the NCSE for additionality where\u00a0they\u00a0can\u00a0demonstrate\u00a0that the current allocation\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0meet\u00a0additional care needs within\u00a0the\u00a0mainstream\u00a0classes in\u00a0the\u00a0school. <\/p><p>Applications\u00a0for\u00a0additionality arising\u00a0from\u00a0significant new or emerging additional care needs, which\u00a0cannot be catered\u00a0within\u00a0existing\u00a0allocations, are dealt with by\u00a0way of\u00a0the\u00a0exceptional review\u00a0process.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. <\/p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. <\/p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100075#WRG04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100075#WRG04200"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[31859\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100075#WRG04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a student (details supplied) in County Kerry will be made eligible for school transport; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation\u00a0managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on\u00a0behalf of the Department.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the\u00a02019\/20 school\u00a0year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.\u00a0Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s \u00a0School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School\/Education Centre as determined by the Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.<\/p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services in the 2020\/2021 school year where such services are in operation. <\/p>  <p>  Children who apply but who are not eligible for school transport are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.<\/p>  <p>  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets using an agreed selection process.

That decision, which was endorsed by the Oireachtas, had indelible consequences for the format of the investigation that was to be conducted, for the mode of engagement with the Commission by third parties who gave evidence, for the rights of those third parties, for the Commission&rsquo;s report, and for its records. <\/p>  <p>  The records of a Commission comprise all the evidence received by, and all documents created by or for, the Commission in the course of its statutory inquiries. The management of these records must therefore be considered in the context of relevant protections and safeguards within the 2004 Act.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The arrangements for preserving the records compiled by a Commission of Investigation in the course of its work are prescribed in Section 43(2) of the 2004 Act. This provides that prior to its dissolution, a Commission must deposit all records with the prescribed Minister. On the expiry of a 30 year period thereafter,\u00a0such records will be transferred to the National Archives and access is regulated in accordance with the National Archives Act, 1986. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Commission of Investigation informed my Department that, during the course of its work, it had created a database of mothers and children who passed through the main Mother and Baby Institutions under investigation. The Commission conveyed to the me the benefit of utilising this database\u00a0but noted the requirement of legislation to provide for this. I concurred with this position, and I have sought Government approval for the urgent drafting of legislation to provide a bespoke solution to this issue. <\/p>  <p>  In my view the development of this database, and\u00a0arrangements for\u00a0appropriate safekeeping and access of this information,\u00a0could be one of the most significant outcomes from the Commission&rsquo;s work. The proposed Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Record, and Another Matter, Bill 2020, provides certainty as to the immediate future of the specific database and associated records. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns expressed by groups and individuals in relation to the proposed legislation and the desire for wider access to information. I proposed to bring forward a number of amendments\u00a0to the published\u00a0Bill to address a number of these matters. I recognise the importance\u00a0for survivors, adopted people and others impacted by birth family separation, of having access to information related to their original identity and family history. I am absolutely committed to addressing the wider matter of providing a new architecture surrounding access to birth information and tracing. Separate legislative proposals will be required and\u00a0this will be advanced as a priority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100077#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100077#WRJ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[31922\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100077#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of adults and children remaining in direct provision centres after their leave to remain has been granted for the most recent date available.","asker":"1468","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>As of the end of September 2020, there were\u00a0709 adults and 311 children who have been grated status, residing in accommodation centres provided by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a specific team in place\u00a0who work in collaboration with DePaul Ireland, the Jesuit Refugee Service, the Peter McVerry Trust, officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the City and County Managers Association collectively to support these residents to access housing options.

The maximum number of subsidised hours available to families increased in September 2020. <\/p><p>The maximum number of hours for an enhanced award, for parents who are working, studying or training, has increased from 40 to 45 hours. For parents who are not working, studying or training, the maximum for a standard award has increased from 15 to 20 hours. <\/p><p>The NCS comprises two types of subsidies:<\/p><p><b>- Universal Subsidy<\/b><\/p><p>- All families with children under age 3 in registered childcare, or children who are over age 3 and have not yet qualified for the free preschool (ECCE) programme, can apply. This subsidy is not means tested, and provides up to &euro;20 per week, or &euro;1,040 per year, off the cost of a registered childcare place.<\/p><p><b>- Income Assessed<\/b><\/p><p>Families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years who are attending registered childcare services\u00a0and who have a reckonable household income (net) of less than &euro;60,000 can apply for an Income Assessed subsidy. Subsidy rates are tailored based on individual circumstances, such as reckonable family income, child&rsquo;s age and educational stage. <\/p><p>The highest subsidy rate is &euro;5.10 per hour for a baby living in a family with a household income of less than &euro;26,000 per year, or &euro;229 per week. The maximum subsidy for a school age child is &euro;3.75 per hour per week.<\/p><p>More information on the NCS is available to parents by contacting the Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday 9am-5pm, or to online www.ncs.gov.ie.<\/p><p><b>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)<\/b><\/p><p>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) is a free universal two year pre-school programme.<\/p><p>ECCE provides children with their first formal experience of early learning prior to commencing primary school.

This initiative which enabled a bulk purchase of approximately 16,500 laptops on behalf of higher education institutions is intended to help address concerns regarding the digital divide in the context of the shift to online and blended models of learning, and the importance of supporting disadvantaged students to adapt to these new models of learning.<\/p>  <p>  The delivery through the National Broadband Plan of high-speed internet connectively nationwide will ultimately provide a solution to current differences in broadband experience for students and learners. In the interim there are initiatives across a number of Government Departments to facilitate connection through community-based broadband hubs and liaison with telecommunication providers on packages, including unlimited data. It is also worth noting that, at the present time HEAnet provides a WiFi solution - Eduroam - designed by and for the higher education community which operates across the education locations nationally. Eduroam allows a student to access WiFi wherever Eduroam is broadcast, enabling a student to seamlessly roam from one Eduroam location to another. <\/p>  <p>  HEAnet is currently working on options to extend the reach of Eduroam beyond the traditional campus locations to areas within the wider community. An extended Eduroam footprint would greatly overcome connectivity challenges and facilitate staff and students in effective teaching and learning activities based at their home location. HEAnet has already made progress in this regard, with Eduroam now available at many teaching hospitals and several public libraries.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently facilitated engagement between HEAnet and relevant Government Departments and Public Sector Bodies to explore the potential for pilot projects trialling the availability to students of Eduroam, via wi-fi hotspots in public infrastructure owned and\/or funded by the State. I anticipate receiving an update from HEAnet on its engagement with these bodies shortly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Multi-Unit Developments","counter":520,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[31924\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide details of the powers of homeowners and management companies under the provisions of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 and related legislation, in relation to management agencies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":522,"content":"<p>The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, was enacted with the primary purposes of reforming the law relating to the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments and facilitating the fair, efficient and effective management of owners' management companies (OMCs).\u00a0 These are companies registered under the Companies Acts, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development and which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of the common areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under\u00a0section 43 of the Property Services\u00a0(Regulation) Act 2011, a person providing a property service, such as a managing agent, must enter into a letter of engagement with a client such as an OMC.\u00a0 The letter of engagement outlines the service to be provided by the managing agent and must be signed, where the managing agent is a company, by two directors of the managing agent and two directors of the OMC.\u00a0 Section 17 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, provides that, as part of the annual report of the OMC, details of contracts entered into by the company must be given to members and the OMC must hold a meeting at least once a year to consider the report.\u00a0 It is, of course, open to any member of the company to raise any concerns they may have regarding any contract with the OMC or at the annual meeting.<\/p>  <p>  One further aspect to note is that section 32\u00a0of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, places restrictions on OMCs entering into long term contracts with providers of goods and services.\u00a0 An OMC is not permitted to enter into contracts for a period in excess of 3 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[31785\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she expects to take Committee Stage of the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 as agreed following the PMB motion of 29 July 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to enacting the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 as soon as possible.

The introduction of statements of truth has necessitated the consideration of drafting of a number of further amendments to the Bill which has slightly delayed my initial intention of taking Committee Stage before the end of October.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, a Memorandum for Government seeking approval of these amendments is currently being prepared with a view to\u00a0progressing to\u00a0Committee Stage in the second half of November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[31793\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100079#WRL03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of barristers by both junior and senior counsel who were on the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s barrister panels in each of the years 2014 to 2019 inclusive; the criteria by which barristers are selected to be allocated cases or briefs by the Legal Aid Board; the number of individual barristers by both junior and senior counsel that actually received instructions or briefs from the Legal Aid Board in each of the years 2014 to 2019 inclusive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>The Legal Aid Board provides legal advice and aid under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996-2017.\u00a0The Board delivers these services through directly employed solicitors in its network of law centres around the country and through private solicitors from its private practitioner panels.<\/p><p>Section 3(3) of the Act provides that the Board shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions.<\/p><p>However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have\u00a0had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board, and I am informed that the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;) provides that the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) may establish and maintain a panel of barristers (&ldquo;the panel&rdquo;) who are willing to provide legal aid and advice on such terms as the Board may, with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, determine.\u00a0 Subject to the provisions of the Act, any eligible barrister who is prepared to comply with such terms and conditions is entitled to have his or her name entered on the said Panel.<\/p><p>There are currently 1,070 junior counsel and 84 senior counsel on the panel.\u00a0 As this is a rolling panel which can be updated many times each year it is difficult to give a figure per year.\u00a0 The Board&rsquo;s immediately available historical data shows that in 2015 there were 45 senior counsel on the panel and there were 765 junior counsel on the panel. <\/p><p>The Board authorises the retention of counsel on a case by case basis.

It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical.
