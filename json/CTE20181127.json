The Supplementary Estimate will bring the 2018 net Estimate for the Vote to &euro;424.214 million.  The gross Supplementary Estimate is &euro;22 million which comprises costs of &euro;18 million associated with the papal visit this year and an estimated additional spend of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions.<\/p> <p>  The Government agreed to facilitate a visit by Pope Francis to the World Meeting of Families during August.  It was a large and complex event.  The OPW, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach, devised the papal visit management plan with the World Meeting of Families, adopting a whole-of-government approach to ensure the health, safety and welfare of participants and visitors.  In implementing the plan the OPW did outstanding work to facilitate the event.  It facilitated the safety of all involved, while at the same time showcasing, nationally and internationally, the attractiveness of Ireland as a country and its ability to host such an event.  Like any event of this magnitude, there are associated costs involved which, in this case, amount to &euro;18 million.  As the event had not been finalised when the 2018 Estimates were published this time last year, the OPW Vote contained no allocation in the 2018 Estimate for the visit.<\/p> <p>  The OPW also expended an additional sum of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions.  They include work on Leinster House and the rationalisation programme for the Department of Justice and Equality which was committed to in 2019 but advanced by the OPW to 2018.  In order to reduce the required Supplementary Estimate, I have sought to allocate &euro;2 million in additional appropriations-in-aid received by the OPW against this request, thereby reducing the requirement to &euro;20 million.  It is worth noting that the OPW expects to provide &euro;25.749 million for the Exchequer for appropriations-in-aid in 2018.  The vast bulk of this income is from the effective promotion of Ireland's heritage sites and efficient management of visitor demands and events at managed facilities of the OPW, including Dublin Castle, Kilkenny Castle and Castletown House.<\/p> <p>  The request for the Supplementary Estimate feeds from efficient and effective work undertaken by the OPW on behalf of the Government.  I am happy to recommend it for consideration and approval by the committee and answer questions members may have about the additional requirement.  If some of the questions are technical, my officials will be able to provide assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112700002#B00300","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1543327200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We have received the more detailed figures yesterday or today and are delving into them.

It was a huge logistical exercise, involving dozens of contractors, all procured under frameworks and in accordance with the rules and regulations.  We also deployed much of our direct labour force.  We had set-ups in ten areas, not just the Phoenix Park, although the one there was by far the biggest.  We also had set-ups at Dublin Airport, &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, the Dublin Castle State Apartments, along the papal city route, at St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral, the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People, Knock airport, Knock, Knock Shrine, as well as the three media centre set-ups.  It was an enormous logistical exercise and from a management perspective we were delighted with the outcome and how it went.  There were no incidents or accidents.  It should be said, with reference to the previous papal mass in 1979 and the one this year, that health and safety represent a far more prevalent requirement now than it might have been in 1979.  It required many onerous but necessary actions by us.<\/p> <p>  I will not go through the process of how we got to it as the committee is interested in the cost.  The cost of which we are absolutely sure, in other words, what has already been paid, is &euro;16.5 million.  There is a further expense of approximately &euro;800,000, of which the biggest element is the cost of meeting the condition of Dublin City Council which allowed us to take down the Phoenix Park gates.  We took down most but not all of the park gates for health and safety reasons and to allow people in and out.  The condition was that we would refurbish them and put them back up.  In fact, they were taken down in 1979 and put back up again.  They were taken down again in 2018.  They are the old historical metal gates in the park which have huge heritage value.<\/p><p>The cost of refurbishing them has not yet been quantified.

Many of them are small businesses.  In fact, as with the walled garden and the organic vegetables, it is fantastic.  I was merely surprised that none of them seemed to have been involved in being preferred caterers, other than being asked to be open.  Clearly, when staff and members of the Garda were working in the final days of the preparation, they had more business.  I am really concerned.  My understanding is that Actavo is part of Mr. Denis O'Brien's commercial interests and he is either the managing director or chairperson of that company.<\/p><p>There are many small cafes in the park and I am not aware that they are part of bigger conglomerates.  I merely wonder what role, if any, did such businesses in the food sector, which could involve people from Kilkenny, Carlow or anywhere around Ireland, play in the papal mass.  Everything seemed to be stamped \"Actavo\".  The company seemed to dominate everything in what was a world conference.  Normally, one would expect local providers.  I am aware the Pope's visit was not confirmed until late.  I want to be fair but I would like to know about that.<\/p><p> There were Ed Sheeran concerts in the park earlier in the year which, I am told, were fabulously successful but I am not aware that a ha'penny of any of the money made on them went back into the park.  I accept there is an estimate here for the railings.  For those who might not know the park, the railings are historically important and practically must be remade by expert craftspeople over a long period.  I understand that.  In the case of the Bloom festival, for example, there was considerable traffic congestion all around the park for days and residents were basically locked in their homes.  Can the OPW confirm whether anything went back into the park from the Bloom receipts and the Ed Sheeran concerts?<\/p><p> Much work needs to be done in the park.  I commend the OPW on the work it has commenced on the Magazine Fort, in reinstating what is a bit of a ruin and a wreck, and which will eventually be a world-class attraction for Dublin.  I am aware, from acquaintances who are working on that project, that it will take years because there is an insufficient supply of funding.  Significant events are being run in the park, they are packed out but yet the park itself, and for that matter, the OPW, seem to be getting nothing back.  Did any money from the Bloom festival or from the super-successful, fantastic Ed Sheeran concerts go towards park infrastructure?  I ask because local residents agreed to put up with a lot of disruption on the understanding there would be a dividend for both the park and the OPW for all of the infrastructure it looks after well around the country.  I put it to the OPW that there needs to be a return from these important public events and I would like an account of it.<\/p><p> All I can say is whoever organised the Pope's visit - it was not the OPW, as it was a taker of orders based on a Government decision - scared most older people in Ireland into thinking that they could not do a two-mile walk up the main avenue.  Those in charge of health and safety went overboard.  People in wheelchairs were not allowed on the main avenue.  Buses, which could have picked up many participants, were not allowed on the main avenue.  Did the church group, which was organising it, call the shots on that?  There needs to be a re-evaluation.<\/p><p> During the first papal visit to Ireland years ago, there were none of these holding pens and gates.  For many, these destroyed the visit because where a family booked four tickets, they got one ticket for one gate, a ticket for another gate and a further ticket for yet another gate.  The park walls, as I am sure the OPW officials will be aware, are nine miles long.  Can the officials imagine a case where a person's mother gets a ticket for one gate, the person's ticket is for a gate two miles away, her husband's ticket is for a gate two miles away from there and the person's granny's ticket is for a gate a further two miles away.  Whoever designed that system, it was mental.  Many elderly people, people in wheelchairs and people with weaker health, who were among those who were keenest to see the Pope in person, were told they were putting themselves at threat.<\/p><p> The third aspect I want to ask about is the big bill for medical aid.<\/p><p>Is that in addition to what the Irish Red Cross and the Civil Defence were doing?

As I mentioned, over 1 million people were reportedly in the Phoenix Park in 1979.  I have heard doubts and questions about that figure because there were no counters involved.  We had counters at this year's event.  For control reasons, we knew exactly how many people were coming in through the gates.  No such facilities were used in 1979.  I do not know whether 1 million people were there.  Anyway, let us say that there were.  It was expected that over 500,000 people would show up at this year's event.  Corralling is a necessary control mechanism for a crowd of that size.  As it turned out, a crowd of that size did not show up.  We had to plan on the basis of the best guess prior to the event, which was that there would be more than 500,000 people in attendance.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the effect on the park of three big events that were held there this year - the Ed Sheeran concerts, the Bloom festival, which is in its tenth or 11th year, and the papal visit, which thankfully does not happen very often.  We hosted a multiplicity of things as well as those events.  We host up to 300 events in the Phoenix Park every year, including charity runs.  Approximately 10 million people visit the park every year.  Over 10 million people of all shapes and sizes come in through the gates to do all sorts of things.  I refer, for example, to commuters and those who visit various facilities in the park, including Dublin Zoo and Farmleigh.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for her kind comments about the Phoenix Park.  We are very proud of how good a facility it is.  Deputies might not be aware that it recently won a gold medal at the world urban parks conference in Melbourne.  We are very proud of that as well.  We think we present the Phoenix Park to an exceptionally high standard.  That has been verified by an international benchmark.  I am not saying I could not do even better things with the Phoenix Park if I had an open chequebook.
