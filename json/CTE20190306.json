I thank her for coming before the committee.<\/p> <p>  The proposed format is that the committee deal with the Vote on a programme by programme basis.  The Minister will give an overview of the Revised Estimate, outlining pressures likely to impact on her Department's expenditure in 2019.

As a result, my Department will spend &euro;1.478 billion in current expenditure and &euro;32 million in capital expenditure during 2019.  Approximately half of the Vote is targeted towards public services that protect children and provide for their welfare.  Another significant portion is provided to continue our journey to build an accessible, affordable and high quality early learning and care system.<\/p> <p>  In addition to these areas, my Department&rsquo;s Revised Estimate for 2019 contains a provision of almost &euro;63.6 million for youth services.  These resources will fund youth services throughout the country, including services for those at risk of disadvantage, and help to address some of the remaining challenges faced by LGBTI+ young people.  The allocation for youth services represents an increase in funding of &euro;3.4 million, or just under 6%, on the allocation for 2018.<\/p><p>Other key items of expenditure include &euro;26 million to meet the costs of the Irish Youth Justice Service, including the operational costs of the Oberstown Children Detention Campus; &euro;19 million to meet the operational costs of my Department; &euro;9.5 million for prevention and early intervention programmes which now include the area-based childhood programme and the prevention, partnership and family support programme; &euro;7 million for the intervention programme for children and young people; &euro;5 million for the Adoption Authority of Ireland; &euro;4 million for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes; and just under &euro;3 million for the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The prevention and early intervention programmes are now fully funded by my Department following the completion of the welcome contributions made by Atlantic Philanthropies in previous years.<br\/><br\/>The select committee will be aware that the single biggest item of expenditure in my Department&rsquo;s Vote is the budget of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  I am pleased to confirm that Tusla will receive additional funding of &euro;31 million in 2019, which will bring its overall allocation to &euro;785 million, which represents an increase of 4% on the allocation for 2018.  When Tusla was transferred out of the HSE in 2014 to become a statutory agency in its own right, its budget allocation was &euro;609 million.  In the five years since its establishment funding has been increased by 29% to its 2019 level of &euro;785 million.  In addition, I am making a further &euro;3 million available to it from my Department during 2019 to fund specific developments in the provision of support for family resource centres and to deal with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  This level of investment underlines my commitment to ensuring Tusla is properly resourced to meet its mission statement in protecting and supporting the most vulnerable children, young people and families.  With this level of investment, there is a strong onus on it to deliver on its ambitious business plan for 2019.  I will work closely with the new chairperson of Tusla, the interim CEO and his management team to achieve the outcomes we all want to see from this year&rsquo;s investment. <br\/><br\/>On early learning and care services, the international evidence is clear that investment in children during their early years results in long-term gains for them, their families, the economy and society in general.  I am particularly proud of the increased resources being made available in 2019 for childcare services which we now call early learning and care services.  I am on record as acknowledging that the radical transformation we want to see in the sector cannot be achieved in one, two or even three budgets.  I have always said it will take time to correct decades of under-investment.  As members of the committee will recall, I received additional funding in 2018 for childcare services by way of a Supplementary Estimate which brought funding levels to more than &euro;500 million for the first time.  The additional &euro;59 million to be provided in 2019 brings funding for early learning and care services to just under &euro;575 million.  Children, parents and providers are all set to benefit.  <br\/><br\/>The increased resources will allow me to continue to meet the growing demand for universal and targeted supports and enable me to widen the thresholds under the new affordable childcare scheme that I will introduce later this year.  Under the scheme&rsquo;s original policy proposals, income-based subsidies would have been available to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;47,500.  This threshold will now increase by 26% to cover all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;60,000.  The scheme&rsquo;s lower income thresholds have also been adjusted, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000, whereas the previous proposed threshold stood at &euro;22,700.  The increased thresholds will mean that thousands of more families will benefit from the scheme once it is launched at the end of the year and see the cost of early leaning and care services tangibly reduce, resulting in a real impact.  <br\/><br\/>I am planning the phased regulation of school-age childcare services and have set side an additional &euro;450,000 for the Tusla early years inspectorate to enable it to begin to register services with effect from 18 February.  This will enable school-age childcare services to access the affordable childcare scheme, help to support children&rsquo;s safety and well-being and assist in the provision of new school-age childcare places, thus improving parental choice and supporting female labour market activation.  Our investment in early learning and care services will help to lay the ground for the exciting opportunities presented by the recently published First 5, A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families<b>. <\/b><i><\/i>First 5 will provide every child with a good, strong and equal start and represents a whole-of-government approach, with the objective of streamlining and improving parenting supports provided by a range of Departments and State agencies.<br\/><br\/>I am pursuing some important legislation as a matter of priority.  I recently announced my intention to table some important amendments to the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 which was passed on Second Stage in the Seanad some time ago.  We are also finalising the text of a Bill to amend the Children Act 2001 that will form the basis for major reform of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system.  I know that the select committee shares my ambition to have these important Bills enacted as soon as possible.  <br\/><br\/>The significant increase in resources in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2019 brings great opportunities for the targeted development and improvement of services.  I will work closely with Tusla, the early learning and care sector, my Department and all stakeholders across the wide range of services provided to achieve the best possible outcomes and value for money we can achieve.  We have made good progress in recent years and I am determined to press ahead with the agenda I have set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#A00400","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement.

The additional increase of 4%, giving a total net increase of 8%, is welcome.  My question relates to the sanctioning by Tusla of privately provided services for families such as occupational or speech and language therapy.  My understanding is Tusla has put in place a new central procurement process for the provision of these services and that it is managed in Dublin.  Will the Minister clarify whether the timeline in the provision of these services and being paid for them is short?  I have heard of one case and I am trying to determine whether it is systematic where services have been provided for a family but Tusla is returning to court to seek a determination on whether the services should continue.  Not only are there legal costs involved, there is also a delay in making payments for the supply of services such as occupational and speech and language therapy.  There is the issue of whether the tendering and procurement process has become overly centralised, leading to people and families living in the regions - I refer to Cork in this instance - being affected by a new structure that has resulted in services not being provided for children.  On the subhead, the issue concerns the cost of procurement and the provision of services, the delay in paying the service providers and the fact that Tusla is seeking a court direction on a case by case basis on the continuity of services such as occupational and speech and language therapy.  Is the case to which I refer systematic?  What are the consequences for service provision for individual children?<\/p><p>I seek an insight from the Minister in respect of the legal costs that accrue to Tusla for family services and the family support programme, whether services are being provided in a timely fashion, whether payment to those providing the services is processed efficiently, whether the added legal layer is eating into the Department's overall budget and the necessity of seeking court direction in certain cases as that aspect is confusing to me.

If Tusla is now seeking court directions, I question the efficacy of its doing so in respect of interventions for individual families because that places a massive onus on the taxpayer in terms of the legal costs inherent in that process.  It is particularly questionable if it has already been determined from professional advice that the child should benefit from very specific services.

Her first questions pertained to the capital programme.  In 2019, the capital provision of &euro;17.19 million will be focused on completing the roll-out of the national childcare information system; the roll-out of the first phase of Tusla's ICT strategy; and commencing refurbishments of some front-line service facilities and staff accommodation at a number of locations around the country, several of which I have visited.  That will be really welcome in those contexts.  There is also a programme for some minor capital works.  That is the answer to the first question.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question, I will address the &euro;1.5 million allocated to the family resource centre programme first.  I am working very closely with Tusla to identify the best way to increase the resources of the existing family resource centres with those moneys.  I met with Tusla representatives recently to look at its preparations for that and its recommendations on how to do that.  Tusla has done a couple of things in that regard.  Tusla representatives have visited the existing family resource centres to gather evidence of their needs.  Some of those resourcing needs arise from increases in costs just to stand still, such as rent etc.  Tusla has also gathered information on the increased costs that would be incurred in developing certain aspects of the family resource centres' work, again according to the evidence of need based on its experience. <\/p> <p>  Tusla is keen to see the most effective therapeutic supports provided through the family resource centres, as am I.  Those are the categories we are examining at present.  Tusla will shortly report to me again with an analysis of the costs according to those categories or the resources that are required.  We will look across the board, again according to the evidence of need and then will make decisions, hopefully prior to Easter, on what can be offered to the family resource centres.  It will not take the form of &euro;10,000 or &euro;50,000 for each one.  Our intervention will be based on scale and size as well as their needs.  In regard to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services, we are trying to ensure that we are responding appropriately to the Istanbul Convention.  One aspect of funding for Tusla has to do with services for children who witness or are impacted by domestic or sexual violence.  As the Deputy identified, we are also examining the potential for increasing places or services and the resources this would require.  We will analyse the needs of the regions, meet representatives of Tusla and then make decisions on how to use the &euro;1.5 million as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#D02300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

I come from a very good space with family resource centres and compliment the investment in them.  Are we seeking to enhance the services provided in family resource centres or expand the centres or are we will invest in staff within them?  Some centres have only one or two staff members, whereas technically they need three.

It is particularly because of having listened to them that I have focused investment on existing family resource centres as distinct from adding new ones, as we did last year.  The representative bodies and individual family resource centres identified that they there was potentially a need for a full staff member or the equivalent of half a staff member here and there.  I was informed that to develop services, centres would like to increase provision for a wider number of children and families.  That is why Tusla has gone through a very careful process of meeting those involved in individual family resource centres to see what each centre considers to be necessary in order, first, to stand still having rgard to the fact that costs have increased and, second, to meet the additional cost of developing services.  We could discuss whether they should move from having one full-time worker to three or from one to one and a half and if that would be a development cost or something required to stand still.  That is the granular analysis taking place of family resource centres to determine their individual needs, as distinct from me saying we want to provide money in order that every centre will have the same number of staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#E00600","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Is it being done on a region by region basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#E00700","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>It is being done by meeting those iinvolved in individual family resource centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#E00800","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>That is fine.

It has been raised with me in recent months that when community childcare service providers are looking for their subventions, they have to give details of the target commitment for each child set by his or her parents.  Throughout the course of the year it may fluctuate.  The number of hours a parent originally thought his or her child would spend in the childcare facility might decrease.  As a result, the facility's budget decreases.  As the service provider tries to react to all of these situations, there can be knock-on effects in the planning of services for the year.  Have solutions been explored by the Minister or the Department?  Perhaps there might be a buffer zone to mitigate the fluctuations.  A parent may commit to his or her child being in a particular facility for a particular period, but circumstances may change.  If parents finish work early, for example, that can have a knock-on effect in the form of fluctuations in the subvention budget.  I am not disputing and agree that there is a need to achieve value for money and for transparency and accountability, but we do not want to put community facilities in such a bind that the amount of administrative and forecasting work they have to do renders them unable to do their jobs when there are fluctuations.

I know that there are a number of queries and concerns about a particular aspect of the childcare scheme - the need for community service providers under the community childcare subvention scheme to identify the attendance levels of children throughout the year.  When they identify whether children are attending for one day, two days or three days, etc., the data are monitored to determine whether they are accurate as time passes.  As people know, childcare service providers under the scheme are paid according to the amount of time children spend with the service provider.  Is that the area about which the Deputy is speaking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#F00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Yes.  I should mention in the interests of transparency that I am a director in a community childcare service.  My decision to raise this matter is in no way linked with that role.  I am bringing it up as a general broader issue for the purposes of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#F00300","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I appreciate that and thank the Deputy.  I know that many childcare service providers and public representatives have concerns in that context.  The process for the scheme which is one of the most popular involves determining attendance levels and, therefore, the amount per child to be paid in fees to each provider.  A snapshot window has been used to identify a period of time of approximately four weeks.  The provider is asked to look at each child's attendance during that period.  This enables trends to be determined and recorded on the Pobal system.  Eventually, Tusla may come along to see whether things are being done as effectively and accurately as possible.  A number of instances of non-compliance have emerged during Tusla's work.  In other words, there was a difference between the attendance figure identified by the service and included in the system and the number Tusla saw when its staff went to the service.  That is what is going on and the response - it is still ongoing - is that my Department and, in particular, Pobal offer to work with the provider to look at the reasons for it.  For example, it could have to do with sustainability issues.  If it does, there is a programme and resource in place in the Department to deal with it.  It works with providers individually and does not necessarily offer money initially.  It may offer advice to enable providers to work more accurately.  Resources are ultimately made available if needed.<\/p> <p>  I think the Deputy's question was pointing to what would happen as we moved to the affordable childcare scheme.  We are on target for families to sign up their children to the scheme in October 2019, with payments set to begin in November.  There will be another process to determine what the payment per provider will be, in accordance with the attendance and time requirements of each child availing of the services of that provider.  After initial agreement is reached on what the parent requires, there will be a more general ongoing periodic report from the provider to Pobal setting out the child's attendance, as the provider sees it.  I think and hope the process will be relatively straightforward.  The ongoing monitoring can almost be described as a form of self-compliance, but I think it is more accurately attuned to the requirements of children, families and providers.  We acknowledge that there has been a challenge and a difficulty in that regard, but supports are provided under the current system.  A new system will be put in place as part of the affordable childcare scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the recruitment of social workers.  Tusla has its own centrally managed internal recruitment process, known as Tusla Recruit.  There are links with regional managers in recruitment.  The process is being strengthened through regional developments and special campaigns are being used.  They are visiting campuses where young people and mature students are completing their work and recruiting in that way.  Tusla communicates regularly with students and partners through the application process.  Obviously, they must ultimately also be registered through CORU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#F00400","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#F00500","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The Deputy also asked about the recruitment of social workers.

The AIM programme and the examination of the evidence there has helped to influence the SNA review in the Department of Education and Skills.  There are three elements to this, the first of which is looking at the ways in which the model itself operates in the ECCE programme, from level 1 to level 8.  There is a cultural level and it is there for everyone, how to be inclusive in a diverse context, the learning for the children up to the provision of additional supports if one wants to reduce the child, staff ratio because of the complexity of the needs of the child in that particular setting.  That is a model, approach and process to supporting children with additional or special needs that is influencing and is there as a possible resource for what goes on then when the child moves into the primary school setting.<\/p> <p>  The second element, which relates to the question from the Chairman, is the transition from the ECCE programme into primary education.  That is also being examined because it is really important.  As we continue to ensure that AIM reaches more children and more settings and we increase the resources for the model my expectation, as a former educator, is that there should be less need over time if we succeed in terms of prevention and early intervention.  The child should be more able for learning as he or she moves into primary and on to secondary level.  That is not to say that if the child still needs it, that the support should not be there.

There was a pilot trial of an after-school care service in County Cork, which a former Chairman of this committee and now Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Jim Daly, discussed here a couple of years ago.  Does the Department have any knowledge of that?  It involved the use of a primary school building after school hours to reduce costs to parents and to provide an environment in which a child could do homework, relax and be supported by teachers or suitably vetted third parties.  These are the sorts of schemes that are invaluable to working parents up and down the country.  My question relates to the fact that I would like to see the State get involved in pushing patrons in particular on schemes like this given that push-back that has been experienced, believe it or not.  My view is that we must do as much as we can in the Oireachtas to support parents getting back into the workplace through work activation schemes, in particular young mothers, which would include the State funding and otherwise supporting those nurturing environments.  It is something I ask the Minister to consider.  There was a trial run somewhere in County Cork and I am interested to hear if the Minister is aware of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2019030600002#K01000","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1551889800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>We are not sure about the Cork project but we can see if we can get any information for the Chairman.

The Minister has proposed to increase the threshold by 26% to &euro;60,000 income per household for targeted supports to be provided for those not in receipt of social welfare, which is very welcome.  The entire programme has, regrettably, taken a little longer than anticipated but it will be a tremendous success in providing supports to low and middle-income families who are not being supported through the social welfare system and are therefore not in receipt of other childcare-related supports.  I do not want to diminish the importance of it, but &euro;60,000 is very low.  I understand that the Department only has so much money and that the State only has so much money, but the knock-on effect of the threshold being &euro;60,000 is that it is lower than the &euro;70,000 household income of a couple where both earn the average industrial wage of &euro;35,000.  As such, the benchmark is &euro;70,000 and &euro;60,000 is, I must admit, a bit disappointing.  What is the projected increase in expenditure for the Department if the threshold were &euro;70,000?

Members will be aware that health systems across the world are faced with the challenge of delivering safe and effective care within the context of limited budgets.  This is certainly the case in Ireland, with our growing and ageing population.  This challenge is compounded by spiralling medicine costs and the ever-increasing demand for access to new, high-tech and innovative medicines.  It is clear that unless addressed, the current system of medicines development will continue to heap financial pressure on a strained health system and will put pressure on Governments to reimburse medicines at any cost.  It will also continue to deny patients access to essential medicines.<\/p> <p>  Members will be familiar with examples of problems of access to orphan drugs such as Orkambi, Spinraza and Pembro, which are now almost household names.  The greatest economic challenges arise, however, when high price tags are attached to drugs that are used to treat more common diseases.  Hepatitis C treatment drugs were introduced to Ireland in 2014 with a list price of &euro;80,000 for a 12-week course.  At that time, an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 patients were in need of treatment, which carried an estimated budget impact of &euro;4 billion.  Fortunately the monopoly was broken and with the arrival of a number of similar drugs, the price was significantly lowered.  I draw the committee's attention to our written statement in which we had mentioned a price of &euro;46,000 per treatment course.  I have since been informed that this figure was much higher and was, in fact, &euro;80,000 in 2014.<\/p> <p>  The difficulties we currently face will appear minimal when new cancer treatments come onto the Irish market.  CAR T-cell therapies, for example, will appear with a price tag of $475,000.<\/p> <p>  I must make it clear that while we are aware that much great work is being done to maximise efficiencies and to create opportunities within the current system, we believe that ultimately the drugs development model is in need of radical reform.  The fundamental problem with the current model is that a patent holder is permitted to demand as high a price as the market will bear for the duration of the associated 20 year monopoly.  We believe that inherently within the current system lies a power imbalance whereby the interests of the pharmaceutical industry take precedence over the interests of the public.  This is a case of the tail wagging the proverbial dog.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Robbie Lawlor will continue this presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019030600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran Harkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Harkin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019030600002#J00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>While the pharmaceutical industry might claim that high prices are essential to encourage innovation, a recent report from the World Health Organization, WHO, concluded that concerns that lower cancer medicine prices might impair future research and development would seem to be misplaced.  Evidence suggests first that prices of cancer medicines bear little or no relationship to research development costs.  Second, financial returns on cancer medicines are high.<\/p><p>Third, the potential impact on revenue due to lower prices could be offset by higher volume, especially when the marginal cost of production is low.  Fourth, governments and the non-profit-making sector have made substantial contributions to the research and development of medicines through direct funding and other incentives.<\/p><p> There are other problems with the current research and development model.  There is a lack of financial transparency to justify the high prices the industry places on drugs, with industry citing \"commercial sensitivity\".  Research and development is directed towards projects which are likely to maximise shareholder profit as opposed to public health gain, hence a plethora of \"me too\" drugs of limited therapeutic advantage and an absence of research into new antibiotics to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance.  There is silo-based research, with companies working on similar research projects but with no communication between them, which may lead to duplication of research and missed opportunities for shared learning.  There is high expenditure on marketing and we know from research that double the amount is spent on marketing of drugs compared to what pharma puts into the research and development of new drugs.  There are also high senior management salary costs.  For example, the CEO of Biogen, the pharmaceutical company that makes Spinraza, received &euro;12 million in pay, shares and other compensation in 2017, even though we cannot reimburse Spinraza due to the high cost of the drug.  A huge proportion of investment in research and development, estimated at 30%, is funded globally from public sources but without public return.  In this respect, the public is paying twice for a drug, as seen with sofosbuvir, the hepatitis C cure, to which Mr. Harkin referred earlier.<\/p><p> Access to Medicines Ireland recognises the efforts of the Government to try to contend with the high cost of drugs.  It has introduced reference pricing and generic substitution, negotiated deals at a national level with the IPHA and entered the BeNeLuxA pact at an EU level, all of which are welcome developments in the effort to ensure and improve access.  This has delivered savings and promises to deliver more.  In truth, though, these measures can only be considered as doing the best we can within a very broken system.  The high cost of drugs is caused by a systematic problem and our policy efforts to date are constrained by that very system.  Together with international organisations such as the UN, the World Health Organization and various campaign groups, we believe there are specific measures that can be taken at an Irish, European and global level.  With regard to transparency, we should support the upcoming Italian resolution on transparency at the World Health Assembly.  We should press for transparency at an EU level and we should attach conditions to public funding of research and development to require increased transparency for any drugs developed as a result.  For price control, we should press for conditions to be attached to research and development grants, both at national and EU level, to ensure there is a price control down the line.  We should consider the use of flexibilities in international patent law, such as compulsory licensing for certain drugs.  In this case, we should potentially push for Spinraza in Ireland.  In February, the UK Parliament discussed the possibility of a compulsory licensing in respect of Orkambi, which has put pressure on the manufacturer, Vertex, prior to forward negotiations this month.  Within recent weeks, the Swiss Government has been petitioned to issue compulsory licensing for a Roche cancer drug, pertuzumab.<\/p><p> In the long term, the use of market exclusivity as an incentive to develop new medicines must be set aside as this disempowers governments seeking to determine a fair price.  Alternative incentives for research and development should include upfront government funding in the form of grants and prizes.  All medicines developed as a result would be patent-free and manufactured generically at affordable prices.  Such models have led to successful research and development by public-private partnerships, such as DNDi - the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative.  Ideally, an EU grouping or an global organisation such as the WHO research and development observatory needs to be established as suggested by the UN High Level Panel on Access to Medicines.  I will now hand over to Dr. Conlan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019030600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robbie Lawlor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>We believe a better system is possible but will only be delivered by parliaments recognising the problem and working together to find a solution.  Governments need to work collectively in order to successfully negotiate with global industry.  At the conclusion of the Netherlands Presidency of the European Council in 2017, Health Ministers discussed and made recommendations around the problems associated with monopoly markets and the abuse of the orphan drugs system.  The recently established BeNeLuxA and Valletta political groups are a good step on the way to increasing intergovernmental co-operation and this needs ongoing support and commitment. In Britain, Canada and the Netherlands, parliamentary health committees have worked to advance the case for an improved system.  The Italian Government proposed a resolution to the World Health Assembly this year seeking to improve transparency of pricing, research and development and production costs, including public sources of funding.<br\/><br\/>We believe the current research and development model is unsustainable and has the potential to bankrupt healthcare systems and to create a small and powerful oligopoly of hugely profitable drug companies, whose primary interest is on shareholder profits rather than public health.  We would like to quote Professor Mariana Mazzucato in her editorial in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>, where she stated, &quot;The first important step to reaching a better deal is for governments to realise that they have the power to actively shape and create markets, and not just remain on the sidelines fixing broken ones, especially in the area of health that is heavily subsidised by the public&quot;.  This resonates with recommendation No. 10 of this committee's report on evaluating orphan drugs in February 2018, which states:<\/p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the State and the HSE has some role in innovation, in collaboration with university structure.

According to the opening statement, the current research and development model is unsuitable and has the potential to bankrupt to healthcare system while failing to advance public health.  It is very hard to disagree with that.  Our questions are to try and scope out the potential for moving away from where we are.  I fully appreciate that nobody has any sympathy for politicians, and we probably do not deserve much, but we end up stuck in the middle.  Most of us are not medical professionals, although some are, and we get stuck between the funding, the families and the pharmaceutical industry.  That is not a very comfortable place for us to be.  My experience is that the current system is entirely set up to encourage that.  One finds oneself in a situation where one wants to do right by the families, while the pharmaceutical companies say they must make a profit or else they will leave.  I do not know how they balance that with what they say about caring about everyone.  Whatever solutions we may have, we can agree that the current system is not working.  It is not delivering for families and it can put politicians in an unpleasant situation sometimes, not that people will have much sympathy for us.<\/p> <p>  On public money, has Access to Medicines Ireland an idea as to how much money the Irish Government spends in research and development on medicines?

I agree with the views expressed that what is happening at present, whereby seriously ill people who know a particular drug is available and has beneficial effects are deprived of it unless they pay a ransom for the drug, is totally unworkable and morally wrong.  The pharmaceutical sector must be regulated in some fashion and the best place to do so is at a European level.  As I have said many times in the past, I do not think any one country can deal with this matter themselves.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the tremendous work done by the pharmaceutical sector.  It does very important and beneficial work in research and development as otherwise, we would not have the drugs at all.  That said, there comes a time when the patient should not become the victim.  Patients are being told that if they have enough money, they can have a drug now or it will be tested on them first as part of a trial but when it proves to be effective. the price will be increased.  This is morally wrong and cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p> <p>  We, at this committee, have discussed the system many times.  I believe that some means must be found at European level and it is not going to work at a national level because no one country, not even the more powerful ones, are prepared to do so.  At present there are drugs that are not reimbursed in the UK, for example, because they are too expensive but they are effective.  It is so sad to see patients being held to ransom when effective remedies are readily available and at the same time, governments are being told to pay up or they will not get the drugs.  I do not know how we can resolve the matter but we must do so through the European Union.  We must use the power of the numbers in the European Single Market to impress upon the pharmaceutical sector that fair is fair.  We must tell it that while we are prepared to go a certain distance, that we know the sector has invested and are taking into account the cost of the investment in research and development, they must be fair to patients.  We must tell the sector we now think it is time that it ensures, having developed its facilities, that patients at least get an even break and we do not have the stark and sad situation whereby only the very wealthy can afford to live.  I am not asking for a response to what I have said as I have said all of this many times before.  We must go back to our colleagues in the European Union in an effort to encourage them to deal with what is happening, and deal with it throughout the European Union, from which we will all benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019030600002#N01000","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>We need to show a good example for the benefit of our colleagues in Europe and shine a light on what is happening in Ireland and at EU level.

One is that they discovered they were funding research but just at the point when it might become commercially available, it was being handed up and the industry was taking it for a song.  They discovered that if they invested just a little more and went one step further in the research to package it to be more commercially viable, then they would get much more value for money.

There are 500 million people in the European Union and they are the answer.  They are a powerful market that has a huge influence.  Their pocket books are important as they can influence policy across the board in a way that nobody else can.  Five million people may have a say in these issues but 500 million people would have a bigger say and we must be realistic.  As I have many times before, we are members of the European Union but we do not always get the full benefits that we are entitled to from our membership of the European Union in terms of access to medicines, which has been deemed to be a fringe issue and is not seen to be a core issue for every citizen in the Union.  The fact of the matter is that it is a core issue.

This area does not have much commercial attractiveness for drug companies because if a company develops a new antibiotic, it must use it sparingly and be very selective regarding where it is used.  The last thing a company wants is sales representatives knocking on every GP's surgery door advising them what to use and for what.  Once a company develops the drug, it must hold it close to its chest so nobody is interested in it.  I do not think any new antibiotics have been developed in the past 15 years, although I may be corrected.  Many drug companies have simply declared that they are not even researching new antibiotics, so this is an area that is open.  The WHO and the UN have an intergovernmental forum looking at how to develop new antibiotics and, when they are developed, how to distribute them.  Clearly, there is no conflict because there is no conflict of interest between the interests of pharmaceutical companies and public health.<\/p> <p>  Pharmaceutical companies' responsibility is to their shareholders.  They do not have a remit when it comes to public health.  Any CEO who goes out of his or her way to jeopardise profit in the service of public health will be fired fairly soon.  Obviously, to be effective as companies, companies need to be seen to have products that are useful and contribute to public health, but companies' remit is not public health.  Their remit is making money.  I am sure all of us around the table know that this is the case.  This ties into the fact that when companies set the price of a drug, the price bears no relationship to how much it costs to bring it to market.  Even if we did know how much it cost to bring a drug to market, companies would still say that they are going to charge &euro;100,000, &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000.  It is like playing poker.  It is a case of thinking someone has money or that someone is desperate enough and will pay.  That is how price is determined at the moment.  As long as we have a model that allows the manufacturer of a drug to charge what it likes, we will pay more than we can afford.

We are being played off against each other when it comes to drug pricing.  Deputy Brassil mentioned Spinraza, which I believe has gone through the BeNeLuxA agreement.  We are given a price and then told it is not the real price, because the list price and the actual price are different.  We are told information is commercially sensitive, etc.  Transparency is clearly a big issue here.  We seem to spend so much time dancing around and protecting pharmaceutical companies' confidentiality when people are suffering daily due to lack of access to drugs, as I am sure the medics are aware.<\/p><p> I am very supportive of centralising assessment through the EU.  We are a body of people with essentially the same rules, so I cannot understand why each country is running this through its national equivalent of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  That is the way we have to move.<\/p><p> When a company proposes a drug, it already knows its market.  It already knows how many people have human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, hepatitis, or a rare condition such as cystic fibrosis.  I am a pharmacist, but I think we should be very conscious that the responsibility of pharmaceutical companies is to their shareholders and not to public health.  As legislators, that is where our concern arises.  Over the last few years in this committee, I have seen that drugs can be available to those who get a good PR company, tell a good story and promote the right victims.  We end up in a situation which I am sure is very concerning to our witnesses as medics, where those who shout the loudest often get the most.  It is a huge injustice.  Suppose that two children have debilitating physical illnesses.  A drug comes out to treat one disease but not the other.  By the power of the pharmaceutical industry, the child for whom the drug has been developed might get &euro;500,000 a year in drug treatment.  The child for whom no drug has been developed gets nothing.  That is a huge inequality, and as a medical professional and a legislator, I find it very difficult.  That injustice is probably why our witnesses are here today.<\/p><p> In regard to how we move forward on this, a lot of people speak about ring-fencing budgets.  The witnesses can tell me if I am wrong, but I always find that if funding is ring-fenced it is a target rather than a bill.  Let us suppose that an arbitrary figure of &euro;100 is to be given to biosimilars or to orphan drugs.  We always end up at &euro;11.  I am concerned about ring-fencing, because if the money is gone in March companies will ramp up their production of drugs to come onto the market in January.  The drug released in June will never see the light of day and the patients will suffer.  I am concerned about the ring-fencing model.<\/p><p> The opening statement referenced generic substitution and reference pricing.  I have lived through that phase as a pharmacist.  Biosimilars promise similar opportunities to those promised by generic drugs 15 years ago.  I understand that legislation was brought in to allow pharmacists to generically substitute.  There is huge pushback against biosimilar substitution from the usual suspects.  Perhaps one of the doctors could give their opinion on this, or any data that might be available.  Are there any costings of the savings we would make if we substituted the top ten rare disease drugs or high-tech drugs with biosimilars?  Every time we provide a branded high-tech product while a biosimilar sits on the shelf, somebody is not getting a treatment as a result.<\/p><p> I am aware that these are used all the time in the Netherlands.  I met with a pharmacist in the Netherlands the other night.  We seem to be behind the curve here.  Is there a reason for this delay?  Is it cynical to think that the position of big pharma in Ireland might have something to do with our slow progress in this regard?<\/p><p> Returning to the issue of the market, there is definitely a move in the pharmaceutical industry to pick the illnesses affecting a massive population, such as cholesterol, and not the very rare conditions.  Firms pick a proper market.  They do the sums and note there are, say, 3,000 children or adults with a certain condition.  They multiply the numbers, determine their top price and cut off 40% to find the lowest point they can go to.  To some extent this is all a game, but the game is costing lives and leaving people without medication.  It is high time we stood up to these companies.  They want to sell drugs and we want to buy drugs, but we are in a position where we have limited and finite resources.<\/p><p> I am quite interested in the issue of access to medication in the developing world where it affects vaccination, HIV control and hepatitis C eradication.  I recently saw data saying that in Ireland and Europe, when we are exposed to fake news or incorrect information on vaccination, many people are able to look at the information, realise it is not as it seems and make their own informed decision.  This reflects our belief in our public health system.  I have seen evidence that in developing countries people may use the Internet as their only source of medical information.  They may not have the benefit of an education system that develops critical thought and a public health system in which patients believe the GP and meet the hospital doctor.  They may not hear about things on the news.  Someone whose only source of news with regard to vaccinations, hepatitis C or HIV is social media can be a really good target for people trying to affect global vaccination rates, whatever their reason for doing so.  If the witnesses have any information on that sort of bias, the challenges it poses to the developing world and how we protect those people I would be interested to hear it.  Funding public vaccination programmes is absolutely pointless if herd immunity is not reached.  It is a complete waste of time.<\/p><p> Dr. Harkin's comments on antibiotic resistance were very interesting.  I had never even considered it before.  There is no money in antibiotics.  There is no money in developing a drug that doctors do not want or whose usage they want to restrict.  I would be interested to hear any more information Dr. Harkin may have on that.  Perhaps he could send it to me after the committee meeting.  I am quite concerned about this.  We can have all the vaccinations and HIV eradication programmes in the world, but if a super-resistant bug appears that is the end of us all anyway.  There is no point in the rest.  Perhaps Dr. Harkin could elaborate on that.<\/p><p> I read one of the documents on antibiotic resistance.  There is now a movement called One Health that combines a view of antibiotic use's effects on the human population, the animal population and the environment.  If I take an antibiotic and excrete a certain amount of it, it enters the water supply.  Farmers put antibiotic bulk powder into pig and chicken feed.  That is totally unrestricted.  The Government does not charge any value added tax, VAT, on it either, but that is another day's work.  Overuse of antibiotics in the animal world and the veterinary field combined with restrictions in the human world affect the environment, which is what we are all talking about right now.  If Dr. Harkin has any research on that or a view he would like to share, I think it would be of value. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019030600002#O01400","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>To address the first two points the Deputy raised, we have done a lot of research into the cost-effectiveness of certain drugs.

We know, thankfully, that because of generic drugs, the uptake of HIV medication has increased in use from around 9% or 10% of the affected world population, when the price was $10,000, to 53% of the affected population today.  That is brilliant and is thanks to generic drugs.  Some 47% of the population still do not have access to HIV treatment.

The real question is why we put more value on my life rather than on the lives of all of my friends in Uganda.  That is the current system.  I am delighted Deputy O'Connell brought up the issue of the developing and lower and middle-income world.  There can be far-reaching effects in respect of generic drugs and we need to understand that.  Regarding education, there was initially a slow uptake of antiretroviral therapy.  Many people at the time were uneducated and thought they could be healed by the power of God or that HIV was actually invented by the CIA in America.  There were many conspiracy theories and they can become rife in countries with a lower standard of education.<\/p> <p>  Thanks, however, to Irish Aid, which pumped a great deal of money into community representation and education programs, we have seen increased uptake of antiretrovirals.  This model works and it needs to be used for vaccinations.  In addition, there is also the issue of not reducing the cost of vaccinations by $5.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res has done many reports on this topic.  A small reduction in the cost can lead to a great increase in the uptake of vaccinations by the vast majority of people who want them.  My perspective is that we should think of Ireland and what we can do at EU-level but let us not forget those whose voices are not being heard on the global stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019030600002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robbie Lawlor"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I will go to our second round of speakers soon.  From what I can gather from the contributions so far, the tension is between the pharmaceutical industry, a commercial entity driven by profit and responsible to shareholders, and health services with limited budgets, responsible to the populations and patients they serve.  That is where the negotiations start.  The EU Council has stated it is within the competency of each member state to decide what drugs are approved and what price is paid.  Are we being exploited by pharmaceutical companies playing one country off against another?  We have seen representations made in the D&aacute;il from groups stating that a certain drug is available in ten or 20 other European countries and asking why it is not available in Ireland.  Moral pressure is being applied to Governments and politicians.  We are all also subject to lobbying from big pharma companies concerning making orphan drugs available for rare and ultra-rare diseases.<\/p> <p>  We have presentations on that issue in the AV room here.  The most recent was on Spinraza but there have been others for many other drugs.  Moral pressure, therefore, is applied to Government and politicians but the same moral pressure does not seem to be applied to the pharmaceutical industry.  It should clearly also have a moral and ethical responsibility if it has produced an effective drug.  To withhold such a drug on the basis of exorbitant cost does entail a moral and ethical responsibility.  The spotlight, however, is not shone on the company.  Many representative groups do not go to the headquarters of pharmaceutical companies and make a presentation there.  They come here instead and put moral pressure on the Government and politicians to pay.  There should be a rebalancing of those responsibilities.  The witnesses might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I know the IPHA would contend it regularly negotiates prices with the Government.  There was an expectation that the resultant cost reduction, I think it was in 2016, would be redeployed to the approval of new drugs as they came on the market.  The IPHA would also contend that Ireland is way below the European average in approving new drugs.  Of 153 drugs referred to by the IPHA, Ireland has approved 49.  That may have increased in the past few months.  There is an expectation from the pharmaceutical industry that savings generated from using generic drugs or negotiating cost price reductions should be ploughed back into new drugs.  The IPHA would contend that is not happening.  The witnesses might also comment on that.<\/p> <p>  There are, therefore, two issues.  One concerns existing drugs and how costs can be reduced.  We are all familiar with people who go to Spain or Portugal and buy certain drugs across the counter for a fraction of the cost here.  There is obviously variation in cost.  Why is Ireland not using its power as a member of European Union to get other European states to negotiate a common price?  Why should a drug in Spain cost a fraction of what it costs here?  Finally, there is also the issue of the new orphan and cancer drugs, drugs for hepatitis C for example, that come on the market all of the time.  How can a small country like Ireland negotiate a price with a global pharmaceutical company?  Surely, as Deputy Durkan said, we should be using our power within Europe to secure a common price for all countries.  I ask the witnesses to comment on all of those points. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019030600002#Q00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I would like to comment on the first point.  I work with many patient organisation groups to put the moral spotlight on the pharmaceutical industry.  We have a real problem, not only in Ireland but globally, of patient groups being pitted against each other.  It may be that a case is made for not paying for prophylaxis for HIV patients because that will lead to the withdrawal of cancer drugs from babies.  That is what we see represented in the media.  We are pitted against each other, although we are all just trying to get the best healthcare for ourselves.  We all have that moral and human right.  Anger may also be directed towards politicians, as we know, and against the NCPE process.<\/p> <p>  A major part of our work as a civil society organisation is to communicate with the public to redirect that anger to something productive.<\/p><p>That is not to ask why is the HSE not paying for these highly overpriced drugs but to ask the fundamental question as to why we allow the drugs to be so expensive in the first place.  If we can get society to ask that fundamental question, we can redirect our effort elsewhere.

I am joined by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, and assistant secretaries Ms Maria Graham, Ms Mary Hurley and Mr. Paul Lemass.<\/p> <p>  As I have stated on many occasions, supporting families and individuals who are experiencing homelessness remains a crucial priority for the Government and for myself as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We all know, of course, that the key to addressing homelessness is the accelerated delivery of social, affordable and private housing and the reform of our rental system.  Although more than 5,100 adults exited homelessness into independent tenancies in 2018, we are all agreed that the number of families and individuals living in emergency accommodation remains unacceptable.  That is why I and my Department continue to focus on preventing as many families and individuals as possible from entering emergency accommodation and are relentlessly focused on exiting as many families and individuals from emergency accommodation as quickly as possible.  There was a decrease in the number of people in emergency accommodation last December, which was understood at the time to be partly due to seasonal reasons.  However, it was followed by an increase in January.  That said, there are some positive movements when it comes to families in emergency accommodation.  For two months now, more families have been exited into tenancies than have entered emergency accommodation.  I recently approved the appointment of 15 outreach officers who will work with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  The recruitment of these officers will further support families and individuals to exit emergency accommodation into independent tenancies.  <\/p> <p>  In tandem with the delivery of permanent social housing, we are working to deliver a range of initiatives and emergency accommodation to support individuals and families experiencing homelessness.  This includes the development of a range of family hub facilities.  By the end of 2018, there were 26 family hubs operating nationally, comprising 22 in Dublin and one each in Kildare, Cork, Limerick and Louth.  In terms of rough sleepers, an additional 300 permanent emergency beds were delivered during 2018 which have meant that there is now spare capacity and shelter for anyone who wishes to avail of it.<\/p> <p>  Separately, my Department has been working intensively with the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality, and Employment Affairs and Social Protection on a range of inter-agency actions in order to ensure the correct supports are in place for rough sleepers and homeless individuals.  This includes appropriate health supports, such as the wraparound supports required for the Housing First programme which offers longer-term solutions for our vulnerable rough sleepers.<\/p> <p>  On social housing delivery, it should be noted that significant progress was made in 2018 in terms of supporting new households.  Some 27,103 households had their housing need met; 8,422 new homes were brought into the active social housing stock through build, acquisitions, voids and leasing programmes, representing an increase of 7% or 553 new homes on what was planned for the year; 4,251 new build homes were delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies, representing 96% achievement of the new build target with nearly 2,000 more homes built compared with the previous year; and the number of new social housing homes built in 2018 was eight times greater than the number built in 2015.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2018, Rebuilding Ireland had delivered over 72,049 housing supports across all delivery streams.  We committed to supporting 137,000 households into appropriate accommodation under build, acquisition and leasing programmes over the six-year period of the plan and, by the end of the third year, we have achieved more than 50% of our target.  The Government is on track to deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland targets and funding is in place to secure this delivery.  Indeed, by the end of 2019, we estimate that Rebuilding Ireland will have supported 100,000 households.<\/p> <p>  The build pipeline now in place is expanding, as evidenced in the quarter 4 construction status report for 2018 that has just been published.  The number of schemes and homes now delivered or in the pipeline is 19,134, including nearly 5,000 homes on site and under construction and a further 2,569 homes at the final pre-construction stage.  The delivery of our social housing build targets under Rebuilding Ireland is currently on track.<\/p> <p>  We have also seen positive news from the Central Statistics Office in the past month regarding the number of new homes built last year.  There was a 25% increase on 2017, with more than 18,000 new homes being built.  In addition, more than 2,500 homes were brought out of long-term vacancy and almost 800 dwellings in unfinished housing developments were completed, meaning the number of new homes available for use increased by almost 21,500 last year.  This does not include the 3,742 bed spaces completed in the student sector in 2018.<\/p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is substantially increasing the supply of new homes and we need to drive new builds higher again this year.  We also know that this increase in supply is contributing to the moderation in the growth in house prices.<\/p> <p>  As Minister, I have frequently stated that we need to address issues of housing affordability, particularly in Dublin and certain other main urban centres.  On affordable purchase, I have commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  I expect the associated regulations and guidance to issue to local authorities shortly.<\/p> <p>  I approved funding of &euro;43 million under the serviced sites fund in December.  This will enable the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes on local authority lands in Dublin and Cork, as well as more than 700 social housing homes.  I envisage that the infrastructure works on approved projects will begin shortly, with the delivery of affordable homes from 2020 onwards.  I will issue a second call for proposals under the fund shortly.  A total of &euro;310 million is available under the fund out to 2021.<\/p> <p>  Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other urban centres are also currently facing significant affordability challenges, I am committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit cost rental sector in Ireland.  Progress is being made in terms of advancing the Enniskerry Road and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate pilot projects.<\/p> <p>  Tackling vacancy remains a key objective in 2019.  In terms of furthering our ambition to maximise the utilisation of vacant housing stock, my Department is now providing funding for a vacant homes office in each of the 31 local authorities.  By the end of 2018, all 31 local authorities had appointed a vacant homes officer and submitted their vacant homes action plans.  These vacant homes officers create a central point of contact for owners of vacant homes and provide them with information including the funding options that are available to assist in bringing vacant homes back into productive use.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the rental sector, I recently published the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 with a view to it being passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in the current term.  The Bill provides a number of key measures and reforms designed to enhance enforcement powers for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, provide greater security of tenure for tenants and further underpin the operation of the rent pressure zone arrangements, along with some further targeted priority measures.  My Department is working closely with the RTB to ensure that adequate resources are provided to tackle any capacity constraints. <\/p> <p>  In addition, the committee recently undertook a review of the proposals I announced to address the short-term tourism-related letting of properties through amendments to planning legislation.  As the committee is aware, I propose to regulate short-term letting through the existing exempted development regime by facilitating unlimited home-sharing and the letting of a person&rsquo;s entire home for a maximum period of 90 days per year without the need for planning permission.  In addition, if a person wishes to let a second property that is not his or her principal private residence, he or she may only do so if planning permission is obtained.  This will be underpinned by complementary amendments to primary planning legislation.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for its consideration of the proposals at a meeting held with my officials in January and the subsequent observations provided early in February, which are being examined.  I look forward to further engagement with the committee as these important legislative proposals are advanced.  As I have stated previously, the Government will continue to be strategic and proactive in putting in place plans that learn from the near decade-long banking and construction and housing supply collapse that is at the root of our housing issues.<\/p><p> We published Project Ireland 2040 just over a year ago as the overarching policy and planning framework for investment in and development of our country.  Project Ireland 2040 loudly signalled the Government's intention, and reflected a public mood, to shift away from \"business as usual\" sprawl-based development patterns and adopt more compact, sustainable and community centred development approaches.  In simple terms, our cities and our towns must grow upwards, not just outwards, if we are to meet the many housing, transport, climate and economic challenges ahead.  Consequently, I have published new statutory guidelines on apartments and building heights that, together with the strategic housing development system operated through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, have kick-started a major increase in housing delivery and interest in apartment development in our key urban centres.<\/p><p> Project Ireland 2040, through the national planning framework and the national development plan is being implemented in order that we plan proactively and prudently for a population increase of 1 million people, together with 600,000 new jobs and more than 550,000 new homes.  It is not just about top-down national planning but also about strengthening the regional and local level planning tiers.  The regional assemblies are at an advanced stage in completing regional spatial and economic strategies for the three regional assembly areas.  The finalisation of these strategies later this year will prompt reviews and updates of individual county and city development plans.  Through this process, Ireland will have one of the most the most up-to-date and nationally and regionally co-ordinated planning processes in the EU.<\/p><p> Vision and ambition is one thing, but people also want and deserve proper oversight and delivery.  This is why the Government has moved to put in place an independent office of the planning regulator to see that the planning process properly implements Project Ireland 2040, as well as a Land Development Agency to make sure the planning process is enabled by strategic land management capabilities to develop in the right places.  These organisations will be critical and will make a key contribution to the delivery of housing and the shaping of our country over the next number of years.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation today and I look forward to working with it throughout 2019.  With regard to the rent Bill I have referenced, following the session we had in recent weeks, I would like, if there is time at the end of this engagement, to talk through in private session some of the proposed amendments that will be tabled on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#C00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>The committee will agree to that if there is time at the end of the meeting.

Will the Minister elaborate on the current status on advancing the Enniskerry Road scheme?  I am blue in the face hearing about Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  What exactly is happening there?  When will we see houses built there?  We have been speaking about this for three years and, from what I can see, nothing is happening.  I went there yesterday to look.  The Minister also might elaborate on the St. Michael's Estate project.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the vacant home officers of the 31 local authorities.  Having spoken to some of the local authorities, I am not convinced they really know their functions.  At some stage in the coming week, will the Minister provide us with a list of the 31 officers?<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  We must be realistic.  I will raise this in the Seanad today.  In the Seanad we are being told we have no business but the Minister can initiate legislation in the Seanad.  That is an option for the Minister.  There seems to be a reluctance on the part of Ministers to initiate legislation in the Seanad.  Perhaps it is an option when we see the schedule in the Seanad.  Will the Minister provide information on a timeline for the legislation on the Land Development Agency?<\/p> <p>  I do not expect the Minister to answer all of these questions now and he may come back to me.  With regard to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, yesterday people woke up to hear on \"Morning Ireland\" about what appears to be a crisis of funding for this initiative.  These are people who are barely over the threshold.  They get up very early in the morning and they work all day.  They want to provide housing for themselves.  Perhaps there was a deficit of information on \"Morning Ireland\" and the Minister can enlighten us.  Will all of the loans be approved?  Can we give hope to people?  It is their last and only hope to provide a home from themselves.  I would have thought the Minister was hot and strong on this particular issue and I am interested to hear what he will say on it.<\/p> <p>  For months, I have been asking about a local authority land inventory.  Will the Minister elaborate on this?  What is the current position with regard to progress on the national affordable housing scheme?<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the Dundrum Central Mental Hospital twice and spoke about the need for a master plan.  Will the Minister tell us about this?  What is happening out in Shanganagh in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area?  For three years, we have been told houses will be built there.  Senator Michael McDowell was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when it was disposed of to the local authority.  We need progress on it.<\/p> <p>  These are a few questions for the Minister to be going on with it.  I appreciate he might not have answers to all of them to hand but in the coming days officials in the Department may be able to give a more detailed response to some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#D00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.

I am waiting for feedback from a couple of key people to finalise this.  Once it is finalised, which I hope I can do this week, I will write to each local authority.  We are there or thereabouts on it.  If not last week it was the week before that I spoke in the D&aacute;il and listed the proposed scheme of priority with regard to someone's connection to the area, someone working in the area or someone whose children are being educated in the area.  These are the various ways in which someone would access the scheme and how they would be weighted accordingly when the scheme is open.  We are doing a final piece on this following what I said in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#D00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The Minister might share it with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#D00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Absolutely, I can do that; it is no problem.<\/p> <p>  The serviced sites fund of &euro;43 million for 1,400 homes was allocated at the end of last year.

In Dublin and Cork, where the money has already been approved, we will see work getting under way this year and completions in 2020.  For the second call I hope to get the regulations finalised this week and issued next week.  I will be out of the country on Government business for St. Patrick's Day and will return for a Brexit Cabinet meeting ahead of the Council summit towards the end of March.  After that, I would like to have a second call so it will probably be the last week of March or the first week of April.<\/p> <p>  With regard to cost rental and what is happening in the various sites the Senator asked about, we are expecting the procurement for St. Michael's Estate to get under way in the first quarter of this year.  I was out with the local community very recently speaking about the plans in more detail.  Dublin City Council, as local authority, will take the lead on this and has set up engagement with the community through a forum.  It is progressing very well.  I continue to tick-tack back and forward with the European Investment Bank on cost rental as a whole and I will come back to this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Shanganagh, we are still working with the local authority and the National Development Finance Agency to compare the various development approaches for the site that have been presented.  A project board is in place and we are getting there or thereabouts.<\/p><p>A valid tender for the Enniskerry Road project has been returned by the three main contractors from a list of six that pre-qualified in the restricted tender process.  That is the stage we are at in respect of the Enniskerry Road project.<\/p><p> We are engaging with the European Investment Bank, EIB, because it is our intention that EIB funding will be made available, certainly in the case of St. Michael's Estate.  The EIB has stated the scheme which has been presented would be valid for an application.  The EIB is engaged in a three-stage research programme in relation to cost rental in Ireland.  We know that there will be more than one scheme.  Our ambition is for cost rental to be as big a part of the rental sector as it is in any other European country, but it cannot be done quickly.  We will have to build up to it over a number of years and it is important for us to get it right as we do.  Research is ongoing.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, has modelled how its cost rental proposals might work.  We are talking about a below market rent of between 15% and 25% in the initial years.  Market rents will continue to increase over a natural horizon, but cost rental rents will not.  Over a time horizon of between ten and 15 years, we are talking about rents that potentially will be as low as 40% below market rents.  When we can get cost rental at scale, we will really start to see significant benefits for a large proportion of people who are renting.  That is what is happening on the cost rental side.<\/p><p> Each of the 31 local authorities has submitted a vacant homes plan.  I can make the plans available to the committee in order that members can look through the ones of relevance to their local authority area.  When I was in the Seanad three weeks ago, I went through exactly what was happening in Senator McFadden's local area.  I set out the interesting work the officer in her area had been doing, for example, in inspecting homes to see how many of them were actually vacant.  The picture that emerges from this work is very different from the high level work.  We know that the CSO number does not really give a true picture of vacancies because it includes homes that are for sale and for rent and holiday homes.  The CSO has been helping the Department to drill down to get a more accurate picture of what is happening in respect of vacancies.  Officers have been appointed in all 31 local authorities and funding for 2019 has been provided for them.  I will provide the information for the committee separately.<\/p><p> The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 has been initiated in the D&aacute;il.  The debate on Second Stage has been concluded.  We hope that having been passed on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, the Bill will be brought to the Seanad in the sitting week ending 19 April.<\/p><p> I understand the committee will soon engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the heads of the proposed Land Development Agency Bill.  We are almost there with it.  We are completing some final technical discussions on it with the Office of the Attorney General.  When we have finalised it, we will be able to bring the Bill before the committee.  Two important aspects of it need to be noted.  First, the LDA is up and running and working on site.  Second, if we want to get a significant capital provision of &euro;1.25 billion for the LDA from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, it needs to be on a statutory footing.<\/p><p> I refer to the inventory of State lands.  Approximately 1,700 ha of local authority and Housing Agency lands have been mapped.  The map is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website.  There are two sets of data - one for publicly owned sites and one for lands committed to social housing.  Local authorities are responsible for updating their land data on a quarterly basis and they are doing so.  The LDA is also looking at the public land bank.  It is assessing what the public land bank might be able to deliver separately from local authority land.  That work is continuing and the Rebuilding Ireland element is available online.<\/p><p> A key site at Dundrum hospital has been identified by the LDA which will be responsible for drawing up a master plan for the site.  We have a dashboard for the eight sites identified by the LDA.  Between 12 and 15 further sites will come into the LDA pipeline during the second phase.

Since the Government took office, the level of homelessness among adults and children has increased by 61%.  At a time when the Government is claiming that more money is being spent on social housing than at any other time in the history of the State, the level of homelessness has increased by 61%.  Since the Minister was appointed to this portfolio, it has increased by 25%.  It has increased by 10% in the past 12 months.  Notwithstanding everything the Minister has just said, on this key indicator, the problem is continuing to get worse.  Is it not time to accept that Rebuilding Ireland, as set out, is failing in dealing with homelessness?  If the Minister does not start to do things differently, for example, by putting some new interventions and investments on the table, the problem will continue to get worse.<\/p> <p>  My second question is related to the cost rental and affordable purchase schemes.  Essentially, the serviced sites fund has been in place since the original &euro;25 million was announced in October 2017.  A year and a half has passed and no new homes have been delivered.  If I understand the Minister correctly, he is saying no affordable homes will be delivered under the scheme next year.  He has referred to 2020.  Will he confirm the position in that respect?  The cost rental scheme has been Government policy since 2014, when the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, introduced the social housing 2020 plan.  It was detailed in Rebuilding Ireland.  I think the pilot scheme was meant to be brought forward at the end of 2016 or in early 2017.  Will the Minister confirm that even though this has been Government policy for five years, no cost rental units will be delivered this year?  The issue of pricing is really important in that context.  If the price is 80% of market rent, whenever we get to see the cost rental scheme, it will not be affordable.  There is no point telling people that it might be affordable for them within five or ten years of being in cost rental housing.  Other European countries find ways to ensure the entry rents for cost rental housing are at genuinely affordable levels.  In Dublin it would have to be somewhere between &euro;700 and &euro;800 a month.  The only way to do this is to extend the loan repayment period.  Will the Minister give us a guarantee that the entry rents on Enniskerry Road, in St. Michael's Estate, Ballymun or the Cork city projects, to mention some examples, will be affordable at that point?  If they are not, they will not address the problem.<\/p> <p>  My final question is related to the overall output of public and private housing.  According to a useful table on page 30 of Rebuilding Ireland which sets out the expected or projected total output of public and private housing, it was expected that just under 14,000 homes would be built in 2016 and just over 18,000 in 2017.  The figures included in the graph for 2018 and 2019 were 22,000 and 25,000, respectively.  The Government is approximately 13,000 homes behind the targets set out in the table.  Does it expect to make up the 31% shortfall in the final three years of the plan, or has it revised its targets downwards?  A 31% shortfall is very significant in the context of the overall level of housing need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#E01100","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Everything we do in housing policy, including every bit of money we spend, is having a very direct impact on the level of homelessness.  We are preventing people from moving into emergency accommodation or helping them to move out of it.  We are putting actual supports in place and supporting the building of more homes that people can live in or rent.  We saw very big increases in the numbers of people entering emergency accommodation in 2016 and 2017.  The Deputy is familiar with the figures for 2018, when we saw an increase that was nowhere near as big as the increases in 2016 and 2017.  This shows that policies are working.  If policies were not working and new homes were not being provided, the increase last year might have followed the trend in 2016 and 2017, when there were quite significant increases in the numbers of people moving into emergency accommodation.  Every time a new person moves into emergency accommodation, it marks a step in the wrong direction.  The fact that the large increases in 2016 and 2017 were not seen in 2018 shows that the underlying measures we have put in place to increase the social housing stock and the housing stock more generally, when taken with other measures such as the introduction of rent pressure zones and the recruitment of more prevention officers, are having a tangible impact.  In more recent times the number of people entering emergency accommodation has been smaller than it might otherwise have been.  In the past two months we have seen something interesting which will represent significant progress if it can be repeated as a trend for the rest of the year.<\/p><p>More families exited emergency accommodation than entered it in Dublin.  If we can continue to have more families leaving than entering, we can start to drive the numbers down.  More importantly, we can know we are succeeding in creating overall sustainable solutions to homelessness for people in emergency accommodation.<\/p><p> We need to keep looking at new measures.  In the course of last year, we had to bring about a Housing First national plan and a dedicated national housing officer, which we have done.  We had to allocate additional funding.  We are doing that and will continue to do that this year, increasing spend on things like hubs.  We also need to look at policy changes and the rent Bill will have a positive impact on the rental sector and prevent people entering emergency accommodation.<\/p><p> At the first housing summit in 2017, I set up an inter-agency group to work between Departments to ensure co-ordination in supporting people in emergency accommodation, whether supports for health or social protection, or supports for families that were not aware of their housing rights and were trapped in emergency accommodation.  That work produced a very good report in June of last year and, since then, we have been working to its recommendations.  The Taoiseach recently brought a memo to Cabinet outlining some of the proposals that are moving forward now in each of those spheres.<\/p><p> We do not rest on this.  We continue to bring new policy interventions where we think they will help.  We continue to increase funding where it will help.  We continue to listen to the experts and our partners in the NGOs.  We are spending taxpayers' money to provide solutions and will continue to work on this until we have helped people out of emergency accommodation.  More than 5,000 people left emergency accommodation last year.  That is huge but it is not enough.  We need to do more.  <\/p><p> The figures for families leaving emergency accommodation in the past two months are important.  Can we continue to drive what we have seen over the past two months for the rest of this year?  Can we continue what happened in 2018 into 2019?  In 2018, there was a significant change in the size of the increase in numbers entering emergency accommodation.  That had been a worrying trend through 2016 and 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#E01200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Before the Minister moves on, can I come back on the homelessness issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#F00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>It is up to the Deputy how he spends his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#F00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I have two quick points.

It is important to note that this is happening and a local authority is doing it.  It does not mean that other local authorities cannot be doing it but, to help them, we set up the serviced sites fund and put additional money into it, following our engagement with Fianna F&aacute;il in advance of the budget for this year.  That is &euro;310 million, as the Deputy knows.  Money has already been allocated in the first round of funding and more will be allocated.  We hope and expect work to commence this year although we will not see completions on local authority land from that fund this year, as it stands.<\/p> <p>  There are two things that are different about what we are now doing with the cost rental scheme.  Cost rental might have been an ambition or an idea but we are now trying to do it at scale.  After we met with Dublin City Council, I identified St. Michael's Estate as a site we could do at scale and deliver in an urban area where there is high demand for housing but it is out of reach for many people.  The other difference is that we are partnering with the European Investment Bank, EIB, so this is a real, long-term scheme.  This is not just a pilot scheme to see if it can work here.  We are asking how to change the rental model in our country using a site where we can do it at scale and using a fund of finance we can afford and which is open to us because of the type of project we are doing.  That makes it different and the key thing is to get it right.  We have dedicated resources in the Department and Dublin City Council for it.  As I said to Senator Boyhan, we are going to see more progress in the first quarter of this year but I also want to allocate more resources to it because of the importance of the project.  We are discussing that at the moment.<\/p> <p>  What is affordable and what is not?  We have looked at different models from the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, as to people on different salary scales, calculating one third of their income and what kind of rent that might allow them to pay.  We are trying to lock that in on each of the affordable sites that we are looking at.  Nothing is final here because we are still progressing things.  It will depend on the number of units, the different facilities that will be provided, who is involved, whether an assisted housing body, AHB, or a number of them and the level of financing from the EIB.  There is no point in doing this if it is not going to actually be affordable.  There is no point in starting this and saying that it is not affordable now but it will be 40% below the market rent in ten years' time.  That is exactly what we are looking at now.  We do not have final figures because the schemes are not yet at that stage.  The NDFA has done a lot of work on this and, from what I have looked at, we are talking about affordable rent for people at particular salary points for individuals and couples, who can apply and the different thresholds that we can put in.<\/p> <p>  I looked at the table and it is not of great quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#F01700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>It is not but it gives approximate figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#F01800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Yes.

I will start my contribution by making a point that has not yet been made.  The number of people living in emergency accommodation is greater than at any time in the history of the State.  In his presentation the Minister mentioned that the number had reduced in December, that the reduction had been expected because of seasonal factors and that it had increased again in January.  According to the latest figures, there are 9,987 persons living in emergency accommodation.  This means that officially there are approximately 10,000 people homeless in the State.  Deputy Eoghan Murphy is the first Minister in the history of the State to be in office when the number of homeless persons is approaching 10,000.  Since he took office, the number has increased by more than 2,000 or 25%.  In my area, the Cork-Kerry region, the number has passed the 500 mark for the first time ever.  All of the information we have available tells us that the main source of homelessness is people exiting the private rental sector.  What action does the Minister intend to take to stem the flow into homelessness from the private rental sector?  The Anti-Evictions Bill is before the committee.  It would ban the sale of a property being used as grounds for eviction, as is the case in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.  It would also ban renovation - so-called reno-victions - being used as grounds for eviction.  Will the Minister support the Bill and get behind it?  Will he admit that it would be the strong radical action needed to stem the flow into homelessness from the private rental sector?  <\/p> <p>  On the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, we learned yesterday that the scheme had been frozen, pending the outcome of negotiations between the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is madness in the midst of the greatest housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State that a scheme such as this would be frozen for any length of time.  We all know the story.  In many circumstances it is people on low incomes and those living in precarious renting conditions who are availing of the scheme.  I have two questions for the Minister in that regard.  Why was the scheme frozen on the quiet, without reference to the committee or the D&aacute;il, and when will it be unfrozen?  I am aware that there are discussions under way, but people want to know that the scheme will come into play soon, rather than in a number of months.  Will the Minister give an indicative date for its reopening?  People are looking for it to happen straightaway.  <\/p> <p>  On the increased use of the HAP scheme, as opposed to new housing provision, the reports tell us that the 2018 figure for active HAP tenancies was 12,215 and that the corresponding figure for new local authority builds was 2,022, giving a ratio of 6:1.  However, new local authority builds include turn-key housing.  I welcome such provision, but, as far as I am concerned, the only way out of the crisis is through increased public housing provision on public land.  The current figure in that regard is less than 2,022.  In Cork, taking city and county areas together, in 2018 the number of active HAP tenancies was 1,130, while the number of new builds, including turn-key housing, was 235, giving the same ratio.  According to research carried out by academics in Maynooth University, over a period of 30 years the cost to the taxpayer of 87,000 HAP tenancies will be &euro;23.8 million more than the cost of providing a similar number of council houses.  Does that policy need to be turned on its head such that the number one priority will be the building of social housing on public land?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#G00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Barry for his questions.  He is right that under my watch as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government the number of people living in emergency housing has increased.  It is my responsibility to put in place every support I can to prevent people from ending up homeless or in emergency accommodation and to try to remove people from such accommodation as quickly as possible but also in a sustainable way.  This involves taking action across a number of areas as we rebuild the housing sector, not in the way it was previously but in a way such that it will not break again.  We also face other challenges such as immigration, people coming home and landlords leaving the private rental sector.   For as long as they continue to leave it people will continue to present to homeless services.  I hope we will be able to keep them from moving into emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  A lot of the work the Deputy is doing could make things more difficult in keeping landlords in the private rental sector and getting more of them into it.  According to the local authorities, over the course of 2018 the number of families in emergency accommodation stabilised.  Thankfully, the increases in 2018 were not as large as in the previous two years.  It was due to the local authorities building more homes, the increases in the numbers of HAP tenancies, the rent pressure zones and the new homes being provided more generally.  Rebuilding Ireland is enabling all of these things to happen, but we still have a huge amount of work to do.  Under section 34 of the new rent Bill we will extend the notice to quit period significantly, strengthen rent pressure zones and provide for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to commence independent inspections to ensure landlords are not abusing RPZs and provide a substantial definition of renovation such that people will know exactly what the case is and there will no longer be so-called reno-victions.  We are hoping to bring forward new actions in the area of social protection to deal with such matters as rent arrears and justice for families trapped in emergency accommodation, including those with complex needs, to enable them to exit emergency accommodation and receive the proper long-term health and care services they need.  We also hope to have additional prevention officers.  As I mentioned, 15 new resource staff have been hired in Dublin.  These are all of the good things that are happening across the area between our partners in the NGOs, the local authorities and my Department.  We are doing everything we can to continue to enable people to exit from emergency accommodation and prevent them from entering it.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's second question about the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, I am genuinely surprised by how the matter was reported yesterday.  The scheme is not closed.<\/p><p>Funding has not run out and I have been very clear on how this has been progressing.  In January I notified that we had reached about 50% drawdown on the find and we remain at about that level.  In February, I notified the D&aacute;il that we would require further tranches to continue the fund and I was in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.  Last week on 26 February, I repeated that statement of 5 February and indicated that local authorities had used up their allocations in certain areas, that ten had received their extra allocations and that discussions for 2019 were are ongoing.  Here we are today just a few days later at the committee, having also discussed it yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  I have put all this in the public domain as has become apparent.<\/p><p> Just to be clear on this, people can still apply for Rebuilding Ireland home loan; funding is still available.  We are almost at our limit but we are not at the limit in terms of the amount approved and what might be drawn down because there is a difference between the two.  It needs to be constantly monitored as the local authorities are doing because they administer the loan in co-operation with the Housing Agency.  That is why I am in early discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While we are only at approximately 50% drawdown, based on the amount that has been approved, we are potentially almost at a drawdown limit if that continues through into the rest of the year.<\/p><p> We have been engaging with the local authorities that have reached their limit.  Some got additional allocations in 2018.  We are watching the rate of drawdown.  Applications to those local authorities can continue.  The reality is that the scheme will need more funding to be made available and that is what I am discussing with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I repeat that the scheme is not closed, funding has not run out and applications can continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#G00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Is the scheme closed in any local authority area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#H00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>No.  Applications can continue to be made.

According to the Minister's figures, 575 loans totalling &euro;107 million have been drawn down.  A further 1,085 loan applications have been approved and those drawdowns have not taken place yet but could take place today or tomorrow.  What is the potential liability?  Does the Minister have an actual figure for the loan amounts for those 1,085 mortgages that have been approved?  Based on the average mortgage granted to date of just about &euro;195,000, potentially that would come to about &euro;217 million.  There is &euro;93 million left in the pot.  By the way people did not apply to this fund for fun because it has been very onerous and it has been managed differently in different local authorities.  If all those loans are drawn down, there would be a shortfall of &euro;124 million based on a &euro;217 million for 1,085 mortgages.<\/p> <p>  Does the Department also have a handle on all those applications to be processed by local authorities on which no decision has been made?  The Minister has said today that the scheme is not frozen.  From that I am taking it that he is still asking people to apply to the scheme.  Will he give a commitment to those 1,085 applicants to whom loan offers have been issued that they will have no difficulty getting finance through this scheme?  Can he give a categorical commitment to those who have made applications and will continue to make applications that they will not have any difficulty?  As Deputy Barry alluded to, some local authorities have started to refuse applications as of this morning.  This is serious.  The Minister needs to get his story correct and provide clarification to the public as to what is happening.  How were the Minister and the Department managing the scheme demand?  If the Department was a business, it would be insolvent.<\/p> <p>  I heard some statement from the Department about duplicate mortgage applications, with up to 20% of the 1,085 having also applied in Fingal, Kildare and Dublin city.  People did not apply for fun.  These are mortgage applications that are quite onerous.  I doubt the figure of 20% of duplications is anywhere near correct.  The Department needs to give a very clear indication that if all those 1,085 mortgage applicants who have been approved under the scheme draw down their mortgages, that money is guaranteed and the funding will be met in respect of any applicant who meets the criteria.<\/p><p>Can the Minister give those guarantees?  It is very important that he does.<\/p><p> I have had numerous emails and telephone calls from people, as I am sure the Department has had.  This confusion should not have arisen and the Minister must take responsibility for that.  Why is it that an internal memo in the Department, dated 31 January, is effectively saying no more approvals should issue for the scheme.  That is what it says very clearly in the memo, which is headed \"Rebuilding Ireland home loan\" and marked for the press office on 31 January.  Is that incorrect?  Basically, we are saying that approvals should issue.

A process is managed between the Housing Agency and the 31 local authorities to make sure the approvals given are drawn down and what the anticipated drawdown is.  It is a constantly moving picture; there is never one point in time at which one can be exactly sure of who is about to go sale agreed, who is about to draw down or what new approvals are to be given by a credit committee.

I want to start with homelessness.  I do not need to refer to the famous quote by the former Minister that nobody would be living in a hotel by June 2017, although we are almost two years on from that.  However, I want to refer to various quotes from the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  In May 2017, he said: &quot;I am considering new policy options and responses to ensure that we can quickly realise the target of no new families presenting as homeless being accommodated in hotels&quot;.  On another date, he said: &quot;...it would seem that the presentation of new families in to emergency accommodation is stabilising.&quot;  He also stated:<\/p><blockquote>The decrease in the number of adults who are homeless is very welcome.  I want to thank our new national director of Housing First for hitting the ground running.<\/blockquote> <p>We are seeing an escalation of homelessness year on year, no matter how the Minister presents it.  What has happened according to the figures he has given us today?  He said 5,100 adults have exited homelessness but homelessness has increased by 526 in the same period.  Some 108 adults per week are being declared homeless, or 15 every day, yet the Minister is saying the homelessness crisis is stabilising.  I do not know how he can make that out.  We are still seeing an increase in the number of families and children on a year to year basis, and because I do not have the figures for how many have exited homelessness, I do not know how many new presentations there are.  However, what the Minister is saying is that 5,626 adults entered homelessness in 2018 - they are his figures, not mine.<\/p><p>Pillar 1 of Rebuilding Ireland deals with homelessness.  Within this, the Minister has 32 of the 38 actions listed as completed and only six as uncompleted.  One of those is rapid build, where only 423 houses have been delivered out of the promised 1,500.  It is time to declare that Rebuilding Ireland is failing in regard to homelessness.  I appreciate and understand the massive effort that everybody is putting into it but it is not working.  Homelessness is not stabilising and, in fact, it is increasing year on year, month on month.<\/p><p>I want to raise several other issues.<\/p><p>I am trying to focus on the tendering process.  How many projects have been stalled, cancelled or just stopped because of on-site issues or issues with the procurement process or the contract?  How many have not, for whatever reason, been completed?  Where does the responsibility for contract approval move from the Department to the local authorities?  It is my understanding that much of this happens because a bond is not in place but a project is allowed to commence before it is in place.  In my constituency, this has led to a number of contracts being terminated and people are now off site.  Is there an issue nationally where a number of projects have been cancelled or stalled because of contractual issues?<\/p><p> I raised short-term letting platforms at my very first committee meeting with the former Minister.  I was very disappointed by the presentation we received on the previous occasion because it only dealt with the planning process.  It did not deal with the regulation required in respect of the short-term letting platforms and, honestly, we need a combination of both if this is going to work.  I have serious questions about the effort and time going to be required from a planning perspective to regulate this sector and how we will ever prove whether a person has been offering short-term lets for less than seven years.  If people have been offering short-term lets for seven years, we are precluded from going after them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#J05200","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":543,"content":"<p>To repeat what I said earlier about homelessness, there are more people in emergency accommodation today than there were a year ago.  It is very difficult for those people who have gone into emergency accommodation in the past year.  In the same period, thousands of people have left emergency accommodation and others were prevented from entering it as a result of the solutions we put in place.  We need to put in place more solutions and I have already outlined some of what we are doing and further improvements we are making to try to make the policy response better.  We are trying to give more tools and resources to partners in the non-governmental organisation sector working with local authorities to help people either by preventing them from entering emergency accommodation or bringing them out of emergency accommodation.  We still have a way to go with the work we are doing.<\/p> <p>  Programmes such as Housing First work.  The latter programme demonstrates a retention rate of 85% when people go into it.  Such people are not falling back into homelessness.  Family hubs work as the average time there is only six months; people spend much longer in hotels.  There is a great retention rate as I do not believe one family has returned to a family hub after leaving for a tenancy.

Where somebody has a medical health need, we put in place a medical health response; where somebody has a rights need, we must ensure to have the right response in terms of meeting that; and where somebody has an issue that could be simply and cheaply addressed if we catch it earlier, we must do it that way rather than allowing those people to find themselves turning up at the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.

We are open to continuing suggestions and that is why there will be more funding this year.  It is why the rent Bill is there and we have hired more prevention officers for the local authorities in Dublin.  It is why we have the inter-agency group and new proposals brought to the Cabinet by the Taoiseach only a couple of a weeks ago.  We have to continue to do more and I am open to all suggestions to help us do it.  The numbers are not yet going in the right direction.  However, as I said earlier, the increase we saw last year was not as huge as it was in the preceding two years.  This lends to what the Dublin local authorities have been saying, which is that the position for families has stabilised.  That is a positive.  It means we might be able to continue what we saw for the past two months, which is more families exiting than entering homelessness.  That is what we want to see and how we will find ourselves getting families out of emergency accommodation and driving down those numbers.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the four-stage approval process.  Right now there are approximately 5,000 houses being built on just under 200 sites.  We have a unit in the Department working with each local authority on any site-specific issues.

The regulation of what is a tourism activity would not fall to my Department so I am using the tools available to me, as Minister, to ensure we can get a significant number of homes back into use, basically not allowing people to \"home share\" a second property in high-demand areas.  We can do that through the planning laws and we believe we can monitor it very effectively, but there will be a point in time, because this is a dynamic part of the economy, where it needs to be regulated as a tourism activity, bearing in mind hotel nights and everything else happening in the economy for tourists.

We would reach the end of the scheme a year early.  The reason I have entered into discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is that given the number of approvals and what we think will be drawn down from the approvals already given, we could be at a point six months hence whereby we are almost at the ceiling in terms of the &euro;200 million tranche.  Those discussions are ongoing.<\/p> <p>  Duplication is allowed because it depends on the local authority to which one is applying.  We keep dynamic control on this.  We can look at a local authority and see the duplicates, depending on what gets approved and what gets drawn down.

That has allowed us over the course of 2018 to say, \"You can approve more in this area because these guys are approving so many, but they are not being drawn down.  You have more flexibility on draw down\".  It is managed in a very dynamic way and that is what gives us the ability to see that it has been more successful than anticipated.

The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation leads on matters such as supply chain issues and certification.  That work is being progressed through that Department.  We have also been in consultation with the CIF and there have been a number of stakeholder engagements to ensure such issues will not interrupt our capacity to build in terms of products and materials.  That said, it is unknown whether there will be delays in the transport of materials and goods because of what might be happening in ports.  We have put in place special provisions in respect of planning and working with the Office of Public Works to ensure there will be no unnecessary delays on our side in a no-deal scenario, but we are dealing with the unknown.<\/p> <p>  When one looks at housing demand in general in Rebuilding Ireland, it is difficult to know what might happen in a no-deal Brexit scenario.  The forecasts from the Department show a slowdown in growth next year.  It will be roughly the same this year but will slow down next year, although it will still be growing.  Does that mean the demand for houses decreases and that house prices and rents dramatically decrease because the economy is not growing as much as people thought it would?  We do not know.  Alternatively, even if that might be happening in the economy, there will be more immigration into the country because of Brexit and, therefore, more demand for housing?  We must keep a close eye on this.  We will have to watch all the different factors and indicators to try to see what is happening.  In the period from 2007 to 2011 there was a very dramatic swing of 103,000 people in and out of the country.  It was huge.

Listening to some of the contributions, one would imagine that the Minister is going around knocking down houses and closing them up rather than building them and providing the most money for housing and the most support for families that I have ever known in my time in public life, which is a long time.  The reason he has had to do this is that the economy collapsed and there was no housing built for years.  He cannot be criticised for investing the greatest level of funding ever provided for Rebuilding Ireland and putting people into homes.  I meet homeless families and I wholly agree we need to do more, however the work which the Minister is doing cannot be denied and it has had some success, such as the 5,100 adults who left homelessness.  I recognise others became homeless, but we must acknowledge the work the Minister is doing.  Some of the statements and queries made here were unfair and unreasonable.  There was a question about whether the Minister knew of any construction projects that he had stopped or that had been stopped.  How can the Minister be expected to know that?  If members know about things which are happening they should inform the Minister and he can deal with it.  When I look at County Louth, I see more and more houses daily.  When I am on the road, I am seeing white vans again after they were absent for many years.  I see delivery trucks laden with construction material and cement trucks day and night, every day.  On my way here this morning, having left home at 6.30 a.m. to get to this meeting on time, there was a massive cement truck which was absolutely laden down with the cement which I was glad to see.  There are many positive and good things happening and I want to acknowledge them.<\/p> <p>  People have expressed concerns to me about Rebuilding Ireland loans.  One family's appointment was cancelled three times.  That is not the Minister's fault, and I am not putting it at his door.  Eventually they were told that there was no funding.  The partner of the person who came to me works in County Dublin.  They were told this week that funds are available in Fingal, although they are not available in Louth.  That creates a problem.  The Minister said that ten local authorities have reached their allocated quota.  Is it reasonable to ask that loans be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis so that no matter where applicants live in the country, if they pass all their assessments, they are given their loan?  If it is the case that some counties have not had the same number of applications and have money available, that money should be allocated to others who have been passed over.  The loan is very important.  It is for those who cannot go onto the housing list because of their income, but whose income is not high enough to get a loan from a building society.  I welcome that the Minister is providing money, and has done so, and has stated that further tranches will be needed and that this is done in a transparent and open way.<\/p> <p>  I have looked at the figures in the HAP update for 2018.  Apart from Cork County Council, the highest number of HAP tenancies are actually in County Louth.  That is amazing, I had not realised the number was so large.  That is significant.  The Minister had a rent pressure zone in Drogheda.  It suggests that rents are far higher for many people.  Has there been any analysis on HAP allocations?  Very good local authority officials are administering it.  Some people complain about the number of HAP tenancies but if they did not exist some people would not have roofs over their heads at all, and they would be homeless.  The reason people are put on HAP tenancies is that they cannot meet the rent at a given time.  Is there analysis?  Some counties have very low figures, although they contain significant urban areas.  Are there significant policy differences around the country?<\/p> <p>  It is important that every Minister appears before the Oireachtas.  They should be, and are, put through their paces on what is or is not happening but we must acknowledge the excellent work that is being done.  The numbers of planning permissions are increasing all the time and the number of new starts are growing.  I spoke to a block layer earlier.  He is paid a &euro;725 retainer weekly to work on a building site and gets &euro;2.20 for every block that he lays.  Is a skills shortage coming?  It is anecdotal, perhaps, but it seems very hard for people to get tradespeople or there are significant delays.  That bring us back to the issue of Brexit.  Have we any indication that a skills shortage coming and how Brexit might affect skills shortages?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#M00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for acknowledging what is happening and the good work the Department is doing with local authorities.  More money has been spent this year on housing than any previous Government spent in a single year.  There were more new homes built last year than have been built in any year in the last decade.  I have had the privilege in my job to meet families who have exited emergency accommodation, whether a hotel, a hub or a hotel hub, into a home.  One can see the benefit of the work that all of us across the Houses are doing to help people out of emergency accommodation, either in supporting Government proposals or in bringing forward their own.  Having been in Donegal, Mayo, Carlow and Kilkenny, in recent weeks I have had the chance to cut ribbons and hand over keys, this re-enforces the importance of what we are doing as a Government.  It also reinforces the importance of a stable Government to be able to do these things.  We have this and it is important that we use it to our advantage to continue the drive.  It also reinforces successes in housing, where we have successes, and continue to seek additional supports where needed to help people particularly in relation to emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  There were several questions about HAP which are all related.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien asked about the number of HAP tenancies last year and the breakdown between HAP and social housing stock.  Some 8,400 homes came through social housing and the rest came through HAP and-or RAS, the RAS number being smaller than that of HAP.  Some of the important things that we see, and this bring us back to Deputy Barry's questions, is that in 2018 and 2017 the same number of houses were supported through HAP.  The increase in supports came through an increase in stock.  We anticipate that this year new HAP tenancies will be less than last year because we will provide 10,000 new homes into the social housing stock.  In 2021, more households will be housed in social housing stock than in HAP-supported tenancies.  We are rebalancing and that is important.<\/p> <p>  A social housing home is a social housing home, whether it is built on local authority land, delivered by a housing body on local authority land or on the housing body's land or on private land, if it is social housing stock.  One in four new builds last year was for social housing.  That will continue again this year at a level of one in four or one in five, which is huge.  I do not have any ideological objection to what we do.  I will use every resource available to increase the stock of social housing.  That is appropriate.  I will not let ideology stand in my way.  That comes back to the Deputy's point.  If we did not have HAP, where would these people go until the homes are built?<\/p><p>That is why we have HAP and why it is such an important resource.

The biggest issue is that he must see there has been a change in circumstances.  There is such demand for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme because there is a new homelessness.  I previously raised this issue with the Minister and I did so with the Department two years ago.  Certain people do not qualify for local authority housing lists.  There has not been a review of the threshold for local authority housing lists in seven years.  I know I constantly bring that up, but it is an unacceptable state of affairs.  We are here today while people are panicking.  More than 500 people have been approved for the scheme but have been left in limbo.  Can the Minister guarantee that those 500 persons who have been approved for a mortgage under the scheme but have not received payment will get their money?  Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that he had to consult with the Central Bank to see if it was comfortable to go beyond the current &euro;200 million fund.  However, he did not make any commitments in that regard, which is of concern.<\/p><p>The Minister addressed affordable housing this in his opening speech.  He stated: <\/p><blockquote>On affordable purchase, I have commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  I expect the associated regulations and guidance to issue to local authorities shortly.<\/blockquote> <p>What is the timescale in that regard?  The lack of affordable housing is a very serious issue that was raised by other members.  Each of the 31 local authorities now has a vacant homes officer.  What is the role of those officers?  I seek clarification for the members of the committee who have many concerns regarding vacant homes.  As the Minister knows, this is a big issue and timescale is the most significant element of it.<\/p><p>The Minister has discussed Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework on many occasions, referencing regional assemblies and the spatial and economic strategies, which are welcome.  However, as I have stated on several occasions, it is very difficult to justify the inclusion of rent pressure zones in the 2040 framework plan when they are not in place in local authority areas such as Carlow and neighbouring counties.  There is no balance.  Not matter how the Minister tries to explain it, there is no balance in one county having rent pressure zones but a neighbouring county not.  County Carlow does not have a rent pressure zone.  This is a massive issue.<\/p><p>The problem has gotten to the stage that I suspect the figures for homelessness are wrong.  Many people are being taken off housing lists.  The Minister stated that he expects demand for HAP to drop.  The reason for that drop is that, for example, the threshold for HAP in my area of Carlow is &euro;27,500 and many people do not qualify for it.  This is why the mortgage schemes are so important.  People are becoming homeless because they do not qualify for the local authority housing list.  They must pay &euro;1,000 rent per month because they do not get HAP as they are not on the housing list.  The result is that they cannot save for a mortgage, which puts them in no-man's land.  These are people who go to work early and do their best, but do not fit in anywhere.  This is where the system is failing.  It is an area we badly need to address.  I acknowledge that I always focus on my area of the country.<\/p><p>On local authorities not meeting targets set by the Department, I was in contact with the Department last week and it was very beneficial.  I wish to compliment the official I dealt with and her team.  I learned a lot from the meeting and the concerns I raised were addressed.  Every local authority is given targets for 2017, 2018 and 2019.  What happens when they do not meet those targets?  For example, I raised with the official the issue of 63 houses that were a target for Carlow County Council two years ago.<\/p><p>We are still trying to sort these issues out.  When the Minister comes to Carlow, it is a bit like Groundhog Day.  We announce these, the Minister comes, turns the sod and then opens them, which is very welcome.  We are getting project after project, but they were in 2017 and 2018 and now they will go to 2019.  Is there a system in place such that the Minister can address this with any local authority?  I am not just referring to Carlow because my colleagues in Carlow are great and I work well with them.  What is the timescale?  When the Department looks for figures and the progress report on each local authority, what timescale is given to local authorities?  Does the Minister say that projects have been on the agenda for three years and ask why they have not been done?  Does he ask why what accountability has been provided for?  We are dealing with people's lives and homes.  One's home is one's castle.  If one cannot get things right with local authorities, that will not work with the public.  The Minister's main route to getting figures is from the 31 local authorities.  Will he address that for me?<\/p><p> Overall, our homeless figures are wrong.  Many people are living at home, sharing, and are not being put on local authority housing lists.  I have a significant problem with homelessness.  What qualifies as homelessness when a person goes to a local authority?  It appears that some local authorities can determine that people are homelessness while others do not.  There is significant confusion.  I have an issue with the housing assistance payment, HAP, but, as the Minister said, it keeps people from being on the streets and we need to address it further.  County Carlow borders counties Laois and Wicklow.  People come to me who cannot find a house in Carlow and have to go to Laois, despite being on the Carlow local authority housing list.  They might only go two miles, not five or ten, but they do not qualify to get HAP and are told to go to another neighbouring county.  When people go to a neighbouring county, they will be told they cannot go on the housing list because they do not have a connection with the county.  Many issues are not being sorted.  Will the Minister and his Department try to make a policy that will balance out every local authority?  These issues are becoming serious and people are becoming homeless through no fault of her own.  We have to look after everybody.  Everybody deserves a home whether or not he or she works but it is harder for people who are trying to get on the housing list and do not qualify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#N02900","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the warm welcome she recently gave me, and for wearing the Rebuilding Ireland jacket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#O00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#O00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":623,"content":"<p>It was great to turn the sod and then come back to see the houses built, with families moving in.

There are a couple of interesting things about the numbers relating to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  Some 70% of people who have been successful in getting approval are earning less than &euro;50,000 and effectively eligible for social housing.  This is a real support for people who are not taking up social housing but are using this loan to get their own home, which is very important.  No one is in limbo here.  As I said earlier, we will honour any approval that has been given.  When one looks at the number of approvals and the expected conversion to drawdowns, we are at between approximately &euro;180 million and &euro;190 million, so we will reach the limit of drawdowns in six months and that is why we will go for early engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about this.  No one is in limbo.  The scheme has supported more than 500 people to date to support to drawdown money and buy their homes.  The help-to-buy initiative has helped get 10,000 people into homes, which is great.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan can do more and the money is there to do more.  As I said, the scheme is not closed and the funding has not run out.<\/p><p>To get a picture of the ratio of approvals to drawdowns, we monitored this and could see when we hit 50% at the end of the first year that the scheme would be more successful than anticipated.  We then commenced discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and these are ongoing.  The Central Bank has to be consulted.  That is not my function but a function of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because it is a mortgage product that occupies an interesting space and is outside part of the Central Bank's macroprudential rules.  The Central Bank would need to be aware of any activity like that on the mortgage market.  It is a tiny percentage of the mortgage market and a small percentage of the first-time buyer mortgage market.  The Central Bank needs to be informed of it, whether there is a change to the policy, which there has not been, or as new funding is approved, an issue that is being discussed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As I said, the reality is that the scheme requires more money to be made available to it because of the activity involved.<\/p><p>With regard to affordability, we have already had workshops and been in touch with key local authorities to approve the first round for the serviced sites fund, the &euro;43 million that I mentioned.  Two or three weeks ago, I announced the regulations coming under the  affordable housing legislation in the D&aacute;il.  Fianna F&aacute;il's housing spokesperson has been reviewing them.  I expect to be able to conclude today following his review and the review of other Deputies who participated in parliamentary questions that day and may come back to me with suggested changes.  The local authorities will decide when they open the scheme, which will be based on when they believe homes will become available.  The regulations will be clear about what they can and cannot do.  The Senator might have missed that, either at the end of March or beginning of April, we will have a second round for the serviced sites fund.  We have already received the economic appraisals from the majority of local authorities about the affordability challenges relating to home-building and home-buying.<\/p><p>Each of the 31 local authorities has provided its vacancy report.  We have vacancy officers in every local authority now, with funding provided to them.  A pilot project was carried out in six local authorities, namely, Cork city, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Limerick, Mayo, Meath and Waterford.  They have surveyed more than 7,000 properties and the number of potentially vacant homes identified in that detailed survey, with people going out to look at a property twice in a period, is just over 400.  We can drill down into the numbers that were first announced.  The numbers were not incorrect but the definition of vacancy was much broader than what we would consider to be a vacant home that could be brought back into use.  That speaks to the vacancy rate in those areas being between 5% and 6%.  This does not mean that we cannot take action.  We are addressing this.  I spoke about the thousands of homes that came out of long-term vacancy last year.  These properties are not the low-hanging fruit that we thought they were.  We have resources in place and we are getting hard data back.  More than 2,000 homes have been recorded on <i>vacanthomes.ie<\/i>, which is run from Mayo, and involves individuals passing a house, thinking it is vacant, and sending a geolocated picture to the Mayo local authority, which then gives it to the relevant local authority elsewhere in the country.  Significant work is being done to address vacancy.  As I said, we will send the vacancy report for each local authority area to the committee so it can view that in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#O00600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":626,"content":"<p>When?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#O00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":627,"content":"<p>As soon as we can.

We are happy to provide that information to anyone.  We have done work on rent pressure zones relating to the current rent Bill.  I cannot say more than that I understand the Senator's point.  The social housing review on income eligibility has been done.  We await that work.  Many things that we are trying to investigate are made more challenging by the housing shortage.  The housing market is still dysfunctional in many areas.  It is difficult to get a proper grasp of what the need might be and what the eligibility criteria should be.  That work is progressing.<\/p> <p>  I thank all those who came to the Custom House for the deep dive relating to targets.  I thought it was helpful for everyone involved.  Local authorities have been given resources, policies and money.  I committed last year that we would have targets for each local authority by each stream of delivery and that we would publish the targets and delivery.  There would be full accountability and transparency.  We can see now who is overperforming, who is underperforming and what we need to do.  When we have encountered significant problems with a local authority and it needs to do more, we step in to help.  We established a taskforce some years ago for Cork city and county.<\/p><p>The task force has shown great results in terms of the increase in housing being provided now for those two local authority areas.  The person who chaired that task force will chair the Galway city and county task force because it needs help.  These are the kinds of things we can do.<\/p><p> The housing unit in the Department tries to troubleshoot particular issues.  While one local authority may resolve successfully a problem it encounters, another local authority might know nothing about the resolution to that problem.  The housing summits help to share that information, as does our housing team which is always doing this work.  Local authorities are responsible to their elected members.  Are the elected members playing ball with the local authority in terms of Part 8 planning applications?  Are they playing ball in helping to progress the right types of housing schemes or the right types of social mix for housing schemes?  All of these issues come into play at local authority level.  Our responsibility is to make sure the local authorities have the policies, resources and money they require, to help address snags where they arise and to provide extra resources where they are needed.  Local authorities are building houses.  They achieved 96% of the target, which is huge.  An extra 2,000 homes were built in 2018 compared with 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#O01000","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":631,"content":"<p>That is good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#P00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":632,"content":"<p>The projection for social housing from before Rebuilding Ireland until now is huge.

I would like to make many points but, given the time available, I will condense them into one central point.  The net effect of the failure of policies to deal with social and affordable housing and spiralling rents and property prices is social cleansing, particularly in Dublin.  The Government's policies, which are reliant on the private sector to resolve this crisis, may have a marginal effect in some areas.  For example, we have heard there has been significant take-up of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme in County Louth.  In areas where property prices are low, one can see how acquisitions, the use of funding from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which is linked to getting a certain amount of affordable housing, and strategic housing developments could work to some extent.<\/p><p>There are many policies, including Part V, but none of them will work or works in the areas where the crisis is most acute or where rents, property prices and site values are highest and rising fastest.<\/p><p> The Minister will not be surprised to learn that I zoned in on that because next Saturday there is a protest in which I am involved, which is one of a series of protests organised by the National Housing and Homeless Coalition.  It is a specifically Dublin-based protest as part of a series of regional protests that we are organising.  We decided to zone in on what is happening in Dublin and the evidence confirms what I am saying.  In all the different areas the crisis affects, average asking rents for all of Dublin rose 82% between 2011 and the end of 2018, while the number of children in emergency accommodation has risen 270% in Dublin from 726 to 2,686.  The number of families in emergency accommodation has increased 278% from 231 to 1,252, while average house prices in Fingal, in the past year alone, have risen 17%, which is an increase of &euro;55,000, and they have risen 17.5%, 15.8%, 13%, 13% in Dublin city, south Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and all areas of Dublin, respectively.  Some 31,196 people are on the housing lists of the four Dublin councils, although that is an artificially low figure because it does not include HAP, RAS or other measures.<\/p><p> If we drill down a little further, the Minister might confirm whether D&uacute;n Laoghaire had one of the lowest approval rates for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  Some 20 out of 99 applications were approved, although I would be interested to know the figures for drawdown.  I had heard that as few as three applications were drawn down but I could be wrong.  Average house prices in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are now &euro;620,000 but the Rebuilding Ireland home loan has a limit of &euro;320,000 and, therefore, it will not work in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is no wonder that there is no drawdown and it is not catching in D&uacute;n Laoghaire because it cannot.  Average house prices in Dublin city are &euro;451,000 and, therefore, it will not work there either and we should forget it.  <\/p><p> On social housing for D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the target between 2018 and 2021, when Rebuilding Ireland expires, is 1,563.  Only six units in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have thus far received Part 8 approval for that period.  Proposed beyond that, rather than already with Part 8 approval, there are 13 in Rockfield Drive and 100 in Ballyogan Court, while there are 208 AHB units.  It is a tiny fraction.  In Shanganagh, although 540 have been approved, we do not know how much of it will be social housing.  We would like it all to be social housing because we will not meet the target otherwise.  Even with the figure of 200 which has been discussed, nothing has happened anyway.  I brought reporters from RT&Eacute; to Shanganagh approximately five years, showed them the site and said there should be public housing on it.  We pushed and pushed, had motions passed - la-la-la - but nothing happened.  If one visits the site again, it looks exactly the same as it did four years ago and nothing has happened.  There is not a prayer of reaching the target in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is linked to the fact that we cannot get the acquisitions there.  Although the Minister is welcome to tell the committee his explanation, I think Shanganagh is delayed because of the affordability that the Government wants, given that it will not build all social housing at Shanganagh.  The Government cannot do the maths in D&uacute;n Laoghaire because the market prices are so high that even the Government's discount on market prices would not bring it anywhere close to affordability.  It just will not work.  We do not know how much LIHAF-related affordable housing we are getting in Cherrywood.  I attended the Hines site and was told that it was costing &euro;400,000 a unit to build.  How will that be affordable?  It will not work.<\/p><p> Against that background, about which I could say more, surely the only answer in places such as that is to build public and affordable housing on public land ourselves at cost price, where we are not in any way dependent on the market.  Instead of that, however, in the past few weeks, DLR Properties, which is a corporate subsidiary of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown - a council controlled by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il - sold Johnny Ronan a site that has the capacity to deliver 380 units.  The Government allowed that to happen.  For what price is Mr. Ronan going to sell them?  What will happen then?  We probably will not get any back under Part V because it will be too expensive for the council to buy.  We will get nothing from it.  On the strategic housing development, the latest project proposed is 270 units in Temple Hill in Blackrock.  How much will they cost?  The council will not be able to afford to buy them back.  None of the measures that the Minister proposes will work in places such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire, other parts of south Dublin, large swathes of Dublin in general or the larger urban centres.  I would like to hear the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#P01200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":638,"content":"<p>The Deputy made a number of valid points about how the challenge of housing is different in Dublin from the rest of the country.  He referred to the failure of policies on social housing and affordability, yet 10,000 more people have been able to buy a home thanks to the help-to-buy scheme, more than 500 people have bought a home thanks to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, while more will get to buy a home through that scheme.  Last year, the bill for social housing was &euro;1.4 billion, which is significant.  I do not know if we have ever produced social housing at that rate versus the size of the economy.  We have also seen that house building has started to put downward pressure on price increases, while RPZs have put downward pressure on rent increases.  That is happening to house prices in some areas of Dublin, where people suspect that house prices are falling, particularly in some of the wealthier areas.  I acknowledge that the Deputy's constituency suffers from that and housing in D&uacute;n Laoghaire can be out of reach because it is so expensive.<\/p> <p>  HAP allows us to do something that we could not do through social housing builds traditionally, namely, create a genuine social mix in buildings, apartment blocks or estates, where social housing was not provided at scale at all, and it is beneficial in that regard.  While it is true that HAP is more challenging in D&uacute;n Laoghaire than in other constituencies, it uses the uplift more than other constituencies, although the uplift is a resource and it is good that is used.  We have also provided additional placefinder support in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to help in that regard.  As the Deputy acknowledged, Rebuilding Ireland is making an important improvement, although he does not believe that it is making enough of an improvement in Dublin.  Dublin has different pressures from other parts of the country but part of the reason we are making the changes that we have made to apartment building was to ensure that more apartments would be built in Dublin, leading to more places and a greater supply of affordable rental properties.  We are examining cost rental in Dublin because of the rental challenges we face in Dublin.  The changes that will occur due to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 will have a very positive impact for people renting in Dublin.  <\/p> <p>  One in two houses bought in Dublin last year cost less than &euro;350,000, although that is still very expensive and different from the rest of the country, where it would have been less than &euro;250,000 outside of Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  There is a different price pressure, therefore, but that is why Dublin was successful in the first round of funding of &euro;43 million for the serviced sites fund.  While Dublin is not being prioritised, the funding is somewhat self-selective and self-prioritising because of those pressures, which is also why a large amount of LIHAF funding is going to Dublin.<\/p><p> I recognise the Deputy's frustrations regarding Shanganagh, but consider Cherrywood, which will be the largest town in Ireland when completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#Q00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":640,"content":"<p>Nothing has been built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#R00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":641,"content":"<p>All of the infrastructure - roads, water infrastructure, playing fields and parks - is there.

Normally, we would have built houses and then wondered about where we would put the roads, Luas stop and schools.  The reverse is happening in Cherrywood.  As it is built, it will rise quickly.  That is exciting and will have a positive impact on the Deputy's constituency.  Where new homes, in particular apartments, have been built in his constituency, they have had a downward pressure on prices in the area.  I know that because I have looked at the information.<\/p> <p>  The number of families in emergency accommodation is higher in Dublin because the pressures are more acute here.  That is why we are investing more resources in Dublin than in other parts of the country.  It is also why the majority of hubs are in Dublin.  We are undertaking these measures in recognition of the fact that Dublin is different from the rest of the country and that some solutions will be more successful more quickly in other parts of the country by virtue of their size or the pressures they face, for example, numbers on the housing list, the number of jobs created, etc.<\/p> <p>  We are not just planning for tomorrow, but for beyond tomorrow.  That is why Project Ireland 2040 is so important.  If we are to ensure that we do not repeat the stark mistakes of the past ten years and two housing crises, one begotten by the other, then we must plan differently.  That means more compact growth, thousands of more apartments and doubling the populations of our other cities, not just Dublin, if we are to avoid the pressures of today in ten or 15 years time after we have come through the current challenge.  That is why the likes of the LDA and Project Ireland 2040 are so important.  They will take State land that was not earmarked for housing and bring at least 40% of that forward for social and affordable housing in places where there might have been no housing at all.  The LDA is already considering eight key sites, comprising approximately 150,000 homes, in strategic high-demand areas.  These are all the things that we are doing under Rebuilding Ireland and Project Ireland 2040 to deal with the pressure points the Deputy outlined in his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#R00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of observations and ask some questions.  I am a glass half full rather than half empty type of person, and I would rather consider what we are doing and where we can improve on that.  I commend the help-to-buy scheme.  The Government got a lot of backlash over it, with claims that it would be an inflationary mechanism.  We have proved that it was not, given the Central Bank limits and rules on purchase prices, first-time buyers, etc.  I commend the Minister, as 10,000 people have homes today who might not have otherwise.<\/p> <p>  Any proposed policy has to be evidence based and the Minister has to show us from where that evidence comes.  That is not always the case with Bills from the Opposition or other parties.  A policy has to go through various legal rounds before reaching the public domain.  The forthcoming rental Bill has had to go through that rigour.<\/p> <p>  Unintended consequences have been discussed.  A number of Bills have been before the committee.  I have agreed with some and disagreed with others.  The latest one is the anti-eviction Bill.  I see that Deputy Barry has returned.  Bills like this create instability and uncertainty in the market.  When we create uncertainty through policies that have not undergone the legal examination that a Government Bill is subjected to, it creates uncertainty for landlords who own one or two properties and are vital for putting roofs over people's heads, causing them to withdraw from the market.  That is why the Houses must be careful with the Bills that we introduce.<\/p> <p>  I may get parochial about the Shanganagh site.  I did not bring cameras there, but anyone who wants to do so can.  That is his or her own choice.  With Councillors John Bailey, Shane O'Brien and Michael Merrigan, I instead brought an actual proposal.  Regardless of whether plan A, B or C is chosen, a proposal with a breakdown of what can be delivered on the site is far more deliverable than bringing a camera there.  My way of coming up with solutions is to make proposals rather than talk about them.  The figures are being finalised in respect of that case.<\/p> <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire faces more complications in terms of the cost of land, but it is achievable.  It might just take us longer.  I would rather build a housing market in our area and across the country that is on solid foundations than one where people want to run before they can walk.  This has to be sustainable and lasting.  We must show continuity and consistency in the construction industry.  We must ensure that the mistakes of the past do not happen again.  I was a member of the local authority from 2004 to 2012.  With the withdrawal of Government delivery of social housing, there was a direct move to Part V and private developments.  That is not the policy in Rebuilding Ireland.  We have moved far from the previous situation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Brexit readiness in the construction industry, I commend the committee on its report.  We engaged with many stakeholders.  Ms Sarah Neary from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government worked with us on it.  She has done a great deal of work on ensuring that materials in the UK and Ireland have the same markings so as to offset possible delays owing to standards in the event of a hard Brexit.  I commend the Department on taking on board the recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The older people policy is a pivotal part of delivery.  In fairness, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has been at the forefront of delivering right-sized housing for people in receipt of social housing.  We now need to move to the private stock.  I thank the Department for taking on board in its own report all of the committee's recommendations and for acknowledging us.<\/p> <p>  Going around in circles talking about HAP gets tiring.  Never have I heard a tangible alternative to it.  At some point, we must call that out.  If someone criticises something, he or she must come up with a solution.  It might not be the solution, but that person has to meet people half way.  It is very easy to be critical all of the time if people do not have to come up with solutions as well.<\/p> <p>  I commend the success of the Rebuilding Ireland loan scheme.  Far more people have availed of it than we envisaged, yet others are trying to turn that into a negative.  I do not get it.  I am not referring to Deputy O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#R00600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":645,"content":"<p>That is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#R00700","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I am always careful not to mention names.  That the loan scheme has been a success should be acknowledged.  We should recognise that there will be a larger demand for it, that the Minister will be seeking further funding and that there will be continuity.  Rather than the negative spin that is a constant when discussing housing, the scheme should be commended.<\/p> <p>  Since the outset of Rebuilding Ireland, the committee has done a significant amount of work.  The Department has taken some of that on board.  Perhaps the criticism stems from the amount of information that we get from it.  That the Department provides so much detail and information opens the Minister up to wider questioning.  I commend the Minister on the amount of information we are being given, including the briefing that was provided to us in private session last week.<\/p> <p>  Regarding delivery, targets are always to be surpassed, not met.  Some are surpassed and some are not.  I welcome that the Minister is examining those that are not and that extra support will be provided in this regard.  The background to all of this is how, in the first year or so, the Government needed to get staffing back in place within the 31 local authorities, get the construction industry back up and running, and give certainty to the financial sector.  We have a skills shortage and are still not half way through Rebuilding Ireland.  I have criticised certain aspects of Rebuilding Ireland, but I must recognise where work has been done and that information has been shared with us.<\/p> <p>  The period in question has seen various protests.  I was in favour of water charges and D&uacute;n Laoghaire had a high compliance rate.  Where infrastructure needs to get up and running on sites, many of the deficits are found in water services.  They have to be paid for somehow.  No one ever links the two.  When we make criticisms about sites sitting around because of water deficits, maybe these people should reconsider the water charges that they wanted to abolish.  Climate change is coming down the road as well.<\/p> <p>  Those were more observations than questions, but the Minister might comment on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#R00800","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for those observations.  I thank her for recognising all the work of the Department.  Transparency fuels accountability.  The Department is probably unique in inviting in committee members to go through the figures in detail so everyone can have the same knowledge of these issues as departmental officials.  We all share the common goal of meeting this challenge head on and resolving it.<\/p> <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan has been a success.  It is another measure that has been successful under Rebuilding Ireland but some people do not want to recognise that.  When people say they would throw out Rebuilding Ireland, I wonder whether they would throw out the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  I do not believe so.  Would they throw out rent pressure zones, the social housing building programme or the 21,000-plus new places available to live last year?  I do not believe so.  Would they throw out HAP?  I do not believe so, even though they criticise it.  Therefore, the Chairman was right to make her points.  It is not to say the work is complete; it is nowhere near it.  We are only half way through but progress has been made quickly.  We are playing catch-up but we are catching up.  We are going to continue to do that as best we can, and with the support of this committee.  We will talk about the rent Bill shortly.  We will have very positive engagement.  It is a real model for how we can get something done in the best interest of everybody.<\/p> <p>  With regard to evidence-based policy formation and the rigour of the rent Bill, the Chairman was dead right to make her point in this regard.  It is important.  The anti-eviction Bill and the anti-eviction measures that have been mooted without any proper investigation have spooked landlords at a time when we are losing landlords and when more people are presenting at emergency accommodation.  One has to see the connection between the two.  There is a law and there is an unintended consequence that people are not bearing in mind when they make pronouncements.  I really wish they would do so.<\/p> <p>  On the Shanganagh proposal, it was shared with me.  The Department began to look at it.  We are making progress but I accept it has been too slow.  There is a multi-stream approach to social housing. If we  just had local authorities building social housing on local authority land and a local authority went bust or something else happened, social housing building would stop.  That is exactly what happened in the past.  Building was essentially outsourced to the private sector through Part V.  That stopped and social housing almost ground to a halt.  We are rebuilding it using a number of streams of delivery.  I refer to build delivery but also to other resources, such as acquisition and leasing, which will protect our ambitions in terms of increasing the stock of social housing.<\/p> <p>  The Brexit report produced by the Oireachtas committee was very welcome.  Well done.  I am thankful for the acknowledgement of Ms Sarah Neary's work in this area.<\/p> <p>  With regard to delivery, we want local authorities to exceed targets.  I want to be battling in regard to additional financial resources each year.  That is the position I was in last year.  I was looking for more money because we were delivering more and we exceeded the targets we had for social housing supports last year.  We will continue to do that this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#S00100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Has Deputy O'Brien a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019030600002#S00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time so my question will be really quick.

The institution can actually recycle that sum as loans are repaid to it.  I had a discussion on this yesterday.  A significant number of applications have already been made even though the scheme has been open for only a few weeks.  We brought about Home Building Finance Ireland because we saw a gap in the market in terms of finance.  It will lend on commercial terms to small builders throughout the country who are building starter homes.  The number of applications looks quite positive.  We want the body to lend, and I have been quite clear that local authorities should make local builders aware of it.  There is a roadshow about to commence with the Construction Industry Federation to get the word out that the bank is open and seeking to do business.  This is good.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Barry's question, all I can say is that the memo is not a housing memo.  I cannot tell the Deputy what is in it because I have not seen the memo.

I am accompanied by the Ministers of State, Deputies Damien English and John Paul Phelan, who will deal with their delegated areas of responsibility.  To assist the committee, we have provided a briefing note on the Department&rsquo;s funding for 2019, as well as other key performance information.<\/p> <p>  Turning first to Vote 34, the Estimate before the committee sets out my Department&rsquo;s budget for this year.  Gross expenditure of almost &euro;4 billion is budgeted for my Department.  This represents an increase of over &euro;600 million or 18% on the provision in 2018.  The gross provision for 2019 is made up of &euro;1.874 billion in current spending and &euro;2.124 billion on the capital side.  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s programmes will benefit in 2019 from resources of some &euro;646 million that will be available from the Local Government Fund. <\/p> <p>  I will turn first to the largest single programme, housing.  This year, in the interests of presenting information in a more user-friendly format, we have expanded the number of subheads from ten in previous years to 25 in 2019.  With the growth in the range of housing measures in the context of Rebuilding Ireland, it was getting increasingly difficult for people to see on the face of the Estimate the specific provisions that were of interest to them.  We have more than doubled the number of housing subheads in the Estimate to cover as far as possible the full range of programmes and we have provided the comparable data for 2018. <\/p> <p>  Turning to the actual financial provisions, more than &euro;2.3 billion is being made available in the Vote for housing programmes this year, an increase of more than &euro;350 million on the 2018 Estimate.  In addition, local authorities will fund a range of housing services to the value of &euro;93 million from local property tax receipts that exceed their LPT funding baseline, bringing the total housing provision to almost &euro;2.4 billion.  This investment will see the housing needs of almost 27,400 households being met this year.  Of these households and housing supports, 10,000 will be new social housing homes delivered through build, acquisition and long-term leasing programmes.  The remaining supports will be delivered through HAP and RAS schemes. <\/p> <p>  A critical focus of 2019 activity is on prevention of, and delivery of services for, homelessness, and an allocation of &euro;146 million, which is up &euro;30 million on 2018, will address the increased demand for emergency homeless services and also assist in supporting homeless households with long-term and sustainable housing solutions.  In 2019, it is envisaged that in excess of 5,000 adults will exit from homelessness into sustainable tenancies through the provision of social housing homes and HAP.  Housing First will continue to be rolled out, targeted at rough sleepers, and funding will also be provided to support the further-roll out of the family hub programme.  Other important housing supports and services that will be funded through the increased resources in the Estimate in 2019 include &euro;13 million in capital funding to support a range of Traveller-specific accommodation schemes, which is up &euro;1 million on last year; &euro;23 million to support the continuation of the mortgage to rent schemes and allow for some 560 households to be supported under the schemes, which is also up &euro;1 million on last year; almost &euro;72 million, up &euro;11 million on 2018, towards supporting the national regeneration programme targeting some of the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities; &euro;25 million will improve up to 3,000 social housing homes through the energy efficiency programme; &euro;57 million, up &euro;4 million on 2018, will be provided for home adaptations to be undertaken, facilitating people with disabilities and older people to continue to live in their own homes; &euro;32 million, up &euro;2 million on last year, is being provided to fund the remediation of a further 460 houses affected by pyrite; &euro;10 million, up &euro;2.8 million on last year, is being provided to meet the operational costs of the Housing Agency and support the agency in its expanded role in the delivery of housing services and supports; and &euro;12.5 million, up &euro;4.6 million on last year, will support the expanded role and functions of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and also accelerate the rental inspections programme by local authorities. <\/p> <p>  Budget 2019 provided for a trebling of the serviced sites fund to &euro;310 million over the period to 2021, meaning that the minimum number of serviced site fund homes that will be facilitated over the lifetime of the fund will be more than 6,000.  The 2019 contribution to this amounts to &euro;89 million.  The Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF, will be supported by an allocation of &euro;41 million in 2019.  This will go towards 30 key public infrastructure projects, such as roads and bridges, which will unlock land for housing development that would otherwise remain stagnant.<\/p><p>The costs of normal domestic water services provided by Irish Water now fall to be met by the Exchequer from the Vote of the Department, rather than through a combination of current funding from the Local Government Fund and a capital contribution from the Minister for Finance, as was previously the case.  In 2019, more than &euro;1.2 billion - &euro;562 million on the current side and &euro;646 million on the capital side -  is included in programme B of the Estimate for meeting Irish Water's costs in respect of domestic water services and providing a capital contribution towards investment.  This includes an increase of &euro;146 million for vital accelerated capital investment in water and wastewater services, as planned for under Project Ireland 2040.  The group water sector continues to be an important element of the water industry in Ireland.  As a reflection of this, a provision of &euro;23 million is made in 2019 for capital spending under the rural water programme, through which funding is provided for group water schemes.  This marks an increase of &euro;3 million on the 2018 Estimate.<\/p><p> Following changes in recent years, principally involving motor tax receipts now going directly to the Exchequer and Irish Water being funded directly through the Department&rsquo;s Vote, the Local Government Fund has returned more fully to its original purpose of funding local authorities, without the circular flows of funds that had built up over the years.  In 2019, income sources into the fund are estimated to be local property tax of &euro;470 million and a payment from the Vote of &euro;185 million.  The latter sum represents an increase of &euro;60 million on 2018.  My Department will make payments estimated at &euro;646 million from the fund in 2019.  Local property tax payments to local authorities of &euro;503 million will account for most of this.  In the local government area, capital investment in fire and emergency services in 2019 will amount to &euro;11.2 million, which represents an increase of nearly &euro;2 million on the 2018 Estimate.  This will allow greater progress on our programme for the construction and upgrading of fire stations, the procurement of fire appliances and other essential specialised equipment and the provision of enhanced communication facilities.<\/p><p> In the planning area, &euro;58 million in capital funding is being provided as the initial tranche of the new &euro;2 billion urban regeneration and development fund, which has been established under Project Ireland 2040.  The aim of this fund is to transform our cities and towns and help to achieve sustainable growth in these areas.  The provision of &euro;58 million for the fund takes account of the fact that among the measures the Government has identified to help to meet the increased costs in 2019 of the national children's hospital is an updated profiling of expenditure under the fund, which has indicated that &euro;139 million of drawdown could be re-profiled from 2019 to 2020 without causing delays to projects. More than &euro;20 million has also been allocated to resource the start-up of the Land Development Agency, LDA, in 2019.  A further &euro;2.4 million is provided to meet the operating costs of the new Office of the Planning Regulator.  Further areas of expenditure set out in the 2019 Estimate include meeting the capital and current costs of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, at &euro;18.5 million, and Met &Eacute;ireann, at &euro;30.4 million.<\/p><p> In 2017, the Government decided to assign to my Department responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority.  A provision of &euro;15.8 million is made in Vote 34 for Ordnance Survey Ireland.  The other two organisations have separate Votes, amounting to &euro;14 million for the Valuation Office and &euro;31 million for the Property Registration Authority.  These bodies are to merge to form Tailte &Eacute;ireann and work is proceeding in my Department on this important project.  I have kept my remarks as brief as possible.  I have focused on some but by no means all spending areas to allow for a full discussion on the programmes and funding of my Department and related organisations this year.  The Ministers of State and I will be happy to deal with matters that members wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019030600002#B00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":675,"content":"<p>We will first take questions about programme A - housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019030600002#C00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to tell us in plain English what the &euro;13 million re-profiling means.

The Deputy will recall that we made the first allocations under the fund last year.  We approved applications worth &euro;100 million under the first tranche of the &euro;2 billion.  There were two streams, A and B.  Stream A involved projects that were basically shovel-ready and ready to go on-site.  We would have assumed from the applications that stream B involved smaller parcels of money because people were being allowed to design projects or put together a case for what would become paid funding for projects in their towns.  We approved &euro;100 million.  Funding worth &euro;100 million was successfully approved.  We worked with the local authorities to look at the numbers for what might be drawn down.  The team in the Department administering the fund engaged with each local authority that was successful in securing funding under streams A and B to see how to get this off the ground and to look at what needs to be done next.  A little more explanation was needed in the case of stream B projects.  Some projects that were not successful under stream A or stream B are now in stream C.  In the course of that engagement, they became aware that not all of the &euro;100 million that had been approved was going to be drawn down.  We think that approximately &euro;58 million will be drawn down in the course of 2019.  That allows for &euro;13 million to be allocated to meet the cost of the children's hospital.  As that money is not being drawn down this year, it will not delay any projects.  An additional &euro;13 million will be provided next year to make sure the fund has all the money that was committed to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019030600002#C00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Was it expected prior to the re-profiling that the projects in streams B and C would have happened, even if they would have taken longer than the projects in stream A?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019030600002#C00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I suppose I can say that there is no delay for any of the projects from a funding point of view.

As some of the projects in stream A are quite substantial, more needs to be done on the preparation side than might have been envisaged.

That is where we are going.  We intend the 2019 increase in moneys to support the &euro;7 million in non-pay costs reflecting the expansion of the RTB's core functions that we have outlined and the forthcoming changes to the rent pressure zones, and to resource the additional powers and functions that will be rolled out for the RTB under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, which the House discussed recently and will be on Committee Stage soon.  The RTB will also be able to initiate complaints and then investigate them.  We are moving towards the annual registration of tenancies.  The RTB continues to develop a new IT system, which will help in acquiring better and more granular data on what is happening in the rental sector ahead of moving towards rent registers and rent transparency.

If I remember correctly, each of the vacant housing officer posts in the 31 local authorities costs approximately &euro;50,000.  Those moneys will be provided through the subhead in question as opposed to through a separate stream.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the funding allocation to Dublin City Council for short-term letting, officials are continuing their engagement on the resource requirements.  The council has an idea as to how it wants to approach this and I have an idea as to how I want to approach it.  Both sides have different demands, but the money is not so much that, if we needed extra, we could not repurpose it from somewhere else.  We are not discussing the &euro;13 million of the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF.

It is not feasible to repay the investment in that period for smaller towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  There are two issues.  First, it does not hit Irish Water's radar because it does not get any return on the investment.  Second, although we need to sustain rural areas and keep our smaller towns and villages alive, there has been a significant decline in population in villages because there is no wastewater treatment capacity.  I could list a number of villages in County Wicklow where there has been no investment in water services for 20 years and there is no capacity to allow them to grow.<\/p> <p>  What influence does the Minister have in how Irish Water directs the money?  Its representatives told us it is approaching the local authorities to get the top three priorities regarding villages.  Can the Minister direct Irish Water to ring-fence a percentage of that capital investment for supporting smaller towns and villages to sustain them and help us with the housing crisis?

We have an overarching policy framework to be met with capital funding that I have to negotiate to get for the body each year or on a multi-annual funded basis, depending on the programme.  It then spends that according to the policies we put in place.  At a strategic level, wastewater is a priority.  As a result between 2019 and 2024, Irish Water will spend approximately &euro;6.1 billion, one third of which will go on wastewater.  However, it is for Irish Water to decide where the wastewater priorities are depending on the assets it has and also engaging with local authorities as to what their priorities are.  I do not direct it in that regard; I direct it at the strategic level about the quantity of money that should be spent in this area and how important it is.<\/p> <p>  Obviously when building houses and communities, we need to ensure the infrastructure is in place.  There must, therefore, be alignment between what I am trying to do as Minister responsible for housing and as Minister responsible for Irish Water.

As we build more homes, the infrastructure is being put in place using joined-up thinking to manage the phasing.<\/p> <p>  I am trying to remember this correctly.  When I last spoke to people in Irish Water on the housing side of the brief, they mentioned a request in the pipeline for 130,000 new connections.

Operating both the NPF and the regional plans from the top level down is causing some problems locally.  As a result of the regional plans and anticipating what will happen down the road, counties such as mine will have to undertake a complete review of their county development plan based on the regional plans.  A number of significant towns have their own local area plans.  One, in particular, has been rolled over twice and it has not had a review of its county development plan for nearly 12 years.  Because the county development plan will have to be reviewed, which will take 18 months, it could be another two and half to three years before that area has a new plan.  Equally, the Wicklow environs and Rathnew plan, which provides for a considerable area of growth, was meant to be implemented this year but will now be kicked down the road for another two years.  Is there no process, especially for the likes of Newtownmountkennedy, which has not had a review for nearly 14 years, or Wicklow and Rathnew, by which they could proceed with their review?  They are told legally they cannot proceed now because that has to run in line with the NPF, the regional plans and the county plans and everything has to be sequenced from the top down.  I could have an argument with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, about the urban plans.  They were going the opposite way.  They were directing policy from the bottom up when it came before us.

My experience of the family courts is twofold.  I ran a project for the Courts Service between 2007 and 2008, reporting on private family law cases.  For the past six years I have been running the Child Care Law Reporting Project which reports on public family law cases.  It is important to emphasise the distinction between private and public family law.  There is a big difference in rights and what is at stake, particularly in the balance of power between the participants.  In public family law cases the State, through the Child and Family Agency, seeks orders to take a child away from his or her family into care for a period that can last for the whole of his or her childhood.  That is a very important and awesome power that the courts have.<\/p> <p>  I am focusing on how public family law cases are dealt with in the courts.  The District Court has jurisdiction to make care, supervision and related orders in respect of children.  I have had an opportunity to read what previous speakers said to the committee about the structure of the courts.  In particular, I fully endorse what Dr. Conor O&rsquo;Mahony of UCC and representatives of the Law Society of Ireland said about the structure of the courts and the urgent need to establish a family court.  Next Monday we will publish a report on childcare hearings in the District Court, based on having attended 35 District Courts throughout the country in all districts.  We found overcrowding, a lack of privacy, lengthy lists and overworked judges in most of the courts attended.<\/p><p>In some of these courts childcare cases were on a mixed list with criminal, civil, private family law and childcare cases.  In most, the childcare cases featured in a general family law list which could be very long, up to 100 cases on a single day, and people can be waiting all day for their case to be heard.<br\/><br\/>The establishment of a family court division of the existing courts, with specialist judges trained in family law and allocated to these courts for a period of two to four years, and with appropriate support facilities to allow for proper management of cases, would address many of the problems in family law.  I would suggest between 12 and 15 dedicated regional centres, where there could be easy access for wheelchairs and buggies, adequate consultation rooms, a comfortable waiting area with a separate room for vulnerable witnesses and children, and basic facilities like drinking water and a vending machine.  It is not beyond our capacity to produce that for the courts and no constitutional amendment is necessary to do this.  Some improvements could be carried out to the existing system and we made certain recommendations in a report published in 2018.  I believe, however, that they would essentially be a sticking plaster.  It is essential to have a new structure of the courts to ensure they can deal adequately with family law.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to alternative dispute resolution.  It is, of course, desirable to keep family disputes out of court as far as possible and alternative dispute resolution offers a useful alternative.  It is important to make a distinction between private family law between two individuals and public family law.  Public family law is not as suitable a vehicle for alternative dispute resolution as is private family law because in public family law the State is on one side and the family on the other, which could be a very vulnerable family.  Many of the people who come before the courts with a childcare case have a lot of problems. They are almost invariably poor, they sometimes suffer from cognitive disabilities or mental health problems and that is not an evenly balanced situation when they are up against the State.  It is very important that their procedural rights are protected and this is done by our courts, including the right to legal representation.  Usually the District Court insists that there is legal representation, which is normally provided by the Legal Aid Board to families who are facing childcare proceedings.  Most of the judges will not hear a case unless people have at least had the opportunity to obtain legal representation.<br\/><br\/>There are areas in child protection where alternative dispute resolution can be appropriate particularly in the following disputes: access when the children are in care; decisions about education of the children or around going on holidays; for psychological and medical assessments of the child; and so on.  People should not have to go back to court to get those kinds of issues dealt with.  It would be much more appropriate and suitable for that to take place in a less stressed environment.<br\/><br\/>On the conduct of proceedings, most of the family law proceedings in the District Court are quite formal because they are often conducted on lists with other cases.  The usual format is followed with the applicant and their lawyers on one side facing the judge with the respondents' lawyers on another.  The witnesses and the parents sit behind them.  This can often be intimidating and confusing for some of the litigants.  A specialist family court with dedicated childcare days should be scope for a greater degree of informality, with parents, lawyers and witnesses sitting around a table with the judge and attempting to resolve the issues.  This format exists in the children&rsquo;s court, which deals with children who are accused of a crime.  It would be a more family friendly environment.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the voice of the child, generally the children do not appear in the family courts.  Mechanisms need to be found whereby their voices are heard.  Some of the previous speakers have drawn attention to the limitations of the existing provisions for hearing the voice of the child.  We would endorse these views.  I also draw attention to a provision in the Child Care Act 1991, which governs child protection proceedings.  This allows for a solicitor to be appointed by the court to represent the child in the proceedings.  This is rarely used, and then usually only when a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is the person who represents the voice of the child.  It is common in other jurisdictions such as Scotland and Germany, for example, for a lawyer to be appointed to represent children who are very young, from as young as two years old in Germany.  I am not saying that we in Ireland have the lawyers who have the necessary skills at this stage but I believe that having a lawyer instructed to represent the voice of the child - who is appropriately trained to received such instruction - should be part of a suite of measures to represent the voice of the child.  Not all of the provision should be based on children having a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, which is currently provided for and about to be provided for in new legislation.<br\/><br\/>On the <i>in camera<\/i>rule, Ireland has two parallel regimes for reporting on family law proceedings.  Following legislation introduced first by the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Michael McDowell, a new law was introduced by the former Minister, Alan Shatter, in 2013.  The first provides for a variety of nominated bodies to attend family law proceedings and to report.  Provided that people are appropriately nominated, and provided of course that the anonymity of all the parties is protected, it is not restrictive as to what reporting can take place.  In 2013 the law was changed to permit members of the media to also attend and report on family law proceedings.  This contains a number of restrictions as to what can be reported.  I believe that the restrictions are listed in such a way that it makes it very difficult for the media to report because the penalties for breaching some of those provisions are very severe: up to a &euro;50,000 fine, three years in jail, or both.  Very few of the media organisations, or none that I am aware of, have the resources to report comprehensively on family law.  There has been relatively little reporting by the media of family law, despite the introduction of that legislation in 2013.<br\/><br\/>Another possibility for getting further information about family law is through published judgments from the Judiciary.  The majority of family law is heard in the District Court.  Given the heavy workload of the Judiciary it is very difficult to see how they could provide written judgments in most family law cases, and no resources exist in the Courts Service to provide for the redaction of the judgments that would have to happen in order to remove all possibly identifying information.  There are a limited number of written judgments on childcare from the District Court published on the Courts Service website.  I am aware that there is a far larger number available but they cannot yet be published because they have not been redacted and the resources are not there for redaction.<br\/><br\/>In my opinion, the only way to ensure balanced and systematic reporting of all family law proceedings is by way of a dedicated reporting body that can attend a representative sample of cases, staying with complex cases through repeated adjournments and publishing the exchanges between the parties&rsquo; lawyers, judges and witnesses, as well as the court&rsquo;s conclusions.  Such a body can and should apply a protocol that ensures the protection of the anonymity of the parties, and filter out any identifying information before it reaches the public domain.  The Child Care Law Reporting Project has a protocol, published on our website, which specifies the kind of information that should never be published to ensure there is no identification.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to the rights of fathers.  This issue arises mainly regarding private family law proceedings.  In public childcare proceedings fathers can be, and sometimes are, named as respondents in the case.  Data collected by the Child Care Law Reporting Project show that the majority of child protection cases involve only one parent, usually the mother, parenting alone, with limited or no involvement of the father.  Where the father is the respondent some judges have made rulings requiring the Child and Family Agency, CFA, to prove that both the father and the mother are unable to safely parent a child before making a care order, and have directed the CFA to support a father in caring for a child, where he is the legal guardian.<\/p><p>We have seen cases where the father is not the legal guardian and the court is not able to make such an order.  In other cases, however, the proceedings have tended to focus on the mother with little involvement from the father.<\/p><p> The issue of legal representation arises here because some fathers may not be able to avail of legal representation if they are above the means threshold, which is limited.  In respect of private family law proceedings, in my 2008 report for the Courts Service I found there was a specific inequity towards certain fathers due to the operation of the civil legal aid scheme.  It is strictly means tested and a situation often arose where a working father earning a modest wage was above the means threshold for legal aid while his wife, if she was a mother, would typically not be working or working part-time, and would fall under the means threshold.  If the relationship broke down, therefore, she would be eligible for legal aid but he would not.  That gives rise to an inequality of arms in legal proceedings and is clearly unfair.  A solution to this would be to remove or significantly increase the means threshold, while asking for a means related contribution from litigants, so a person on an average income could avail of the civil legal aid scheme and contribute according to his or her means.<\/p><p> My colleague, Maria Corbett, and I will be happy to answer any questions the committee may have.   I have left three reports with the clerk, which go into more detail on some points.  In particular, Ms Corbett can address specific issues relating to the impact of Brexit on child protection proceedings.  We are concerned about that matter and, although it is not on the committee's agenda now, we would very much like to draw its attention to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Carol Coulter","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Coulter and call Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Shea of Arc Mediation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#K00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":759,"content":"<p>Somehow this conversation always starts at the wrong end of the pipeline - in the courtroom.

Much of my detailed submission to the committee arises from my 2014 PhD thesis, a three-year empirical study of 1,200 cases in the Circuit Court all over Ireland, which was funded by the Irish Research Council.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel; we need to grab and adapt the most effective solutions from other jurisdictions and adapt them for the Irish landscape.  In the District Court, I found that family law litigants experience two different worlds.  There are still impossibly long lists in the provincial courts.  However, litigants in Dolphin House, by contrast, benefit from a brilliant innovative system implemented by Eoin Manning and now operated by Eamonn Doherty, where almost 95% of the litigants are now self-representing.  Judges who have a strong commitment to the area have developed a quasi-mediation or inquisitorial approach, which reduces conflict in the courtroom.  Judge Gerard Furlong is the lead innovator in this area and he shows an extraordinary empathy, understanding and patience, while implementing the law fairly.  Right now, we should start to work with what we have.  People cannot wait for shiny new buildings or for reform of a system that is not fit for the users of that system.  I am all about the users and I am about solutions.<\/p> <p>  We should start with families experiencing financial hardship.  The State should offer two access points for fast intervention.  Path A would leverage existing State resources, in the community, at local level, and start diverting people away from the courtroom.  I am involved in a research project with Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  Our family mediation project is now available across the south of Dublin city in four family resource centres, FRCs - Quarryvale, Killinarden, St Kevin&rsquo;s in Kilnamanagh, and Ballyboden.  Mediation is provided by a team of volunteer mediators from the not-for-profit Dublin Community Mediation.  Appointments are available in ten days.  The services is means tested; there is a flat hourly rate of &euro;25, which can be waived in cases of financial hardship.  It is child-inclusive mediation.  Cases are co-mediated and bi-gender.  It is court-linked.  Issues that can be mediated are guardianship, custody, access and maintenance.  The mediator assists the parents and children to access the wide range of supports available in the FRCs, including counselling, play therapy, parenting courses, support groups, and referrals for mental health or addiction issues, which crop up in many of the cases we are dealing with.  The mediator can signpost additional resources such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, free legal advice centres, FLAC, and Citizens Information Board.<\/p> <p>  On path B, the State family mediation service could then be freed up to focus on separation and divorce.  There needs to be a form of means testing.  The service is currently free and that is not working; the lists are too long.  Means testing would mean these State resources would be targeted at the users who need them most.  A less complicated means testing approach could be used.  Our research project has developed such an approach and gave it to the AALS family mediation project at Denver university, which is running it at the moment.  This two-level offering by the State, for the users that need it most, at local level and through the Legal Aid Board, would slash waiting times and get appropriate help to families at the earliest possible point.<\/p> <p>  If we are starting at the beginning of the pipeline, we should have mandatory mediation information sessions for parents, which are provided for in the Act, and mandatory intake sessions, which would help people to understand the process.  Research in California shows that once people have attended the first mediation session, 80% tend to go on.  The regulation of mediation must remain a priority.  I am in a working group convened by the Legal Aid Board to work towards forming a mediation council.  Once that council gets about its work as set out in the Act, the uptake of mediation will then increase as potential users know what it is, understand the benefits, and become confident of the training standards and competency of mediators. <\/p> <p>  The two main reasons I have observed for choosing litigation as the first option is that people believe or are being told that they will get a better outcome, or they believe they will get their day in court and that the judge will tell the other person they are wrong.  People need to understand that neither is likely to be true.  The overwhelming majority of cases that litigate settle in the corridors outside courtrooms.  In effect, people are actually coming to a settlement agreement.<\/p> <p>  I refer next to what the Government can do in the area of VAT.  The bulk of our private family mediation work is charged at a rate of &euro;123 per hour, of which &euro;23 is VAT.  One immediate step the Government could take to support families in distress is reduce the tax on those fees.  Those who need the services of a family mediator or a family law solicitor are individuals rather than businesses and, therefore, cannot reclaim VAT, which at the current rate of 23% is almost a quarter on top of the fees charged.  Nuala Jackson, senior counsel, who is here today, sets out in detail in our submission that our framework for resolution of disputes must take the following into account.  We must have satisfactory resolution for those who are in dispute.  It must come in a timely manner with the least acrimony possible, and it must be affordable to those who are in dispute.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the end of the pipeline, what can we do about the courtroom itself?  We need specialist volunteer family law judges with a genuine interest in this area of law, who are not rostered or forced to take the cases but who opt in.  We could use the 80:20 Canadian approach, where a judge does family law cases 80% of the time and locum work or other material 20%.  The judges tell me they would go crazy if they did family law 100% of the time.  We should also ensure that specialist family law judges have an aptitude and personality suitable for family law.  Not every judge I have seen in the courtroom is a suitable person to hear family law cases.  We need to change the jurisdiction of the courts.  Our system currently discriminates against married people.  They are forced to make any application relating to separation or divorce at Circuit Court level, which is generally a much more costly exercise with greater time delays.  I propose that all private family law matters relating to children and maintenance be heard in the District Court, and the Circuit Court deal with everything else in respect of separation and divorce.  This would get children the help they need fast in terms of access and parenting.  We need regional hubs with as many days as are needed so that we can move to a case managed system like the one in Oshawa family courts, Toronto, where specific appointment times are set for a case to be heard and there is no gathering of multiple cases at a courthouse at the start of the day for call-over.  When I observed the court cases in Oshawa, I was shocked that there was nobody in the building.  I thought I was in the wrong building or had the wrong day.  I realised there were appointments at 10 a.m., 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.  <\/p> <p>  Users need predictability.  The unfettered discretion of judges results in a considerable variation of approach and outcome, even with the same judge on different days.<\/p><p>It is difficult to identify any pattern, with outcomes depending on the personal views and disposition of a judge.  We need formulas that quantify maintenance and guidelines for all other matters.  These exist in other countries and if the committee wants me to, I am happy to ask for permission from Canada, New Zealand and Australia for us to use those here.  They have already indicated we can have them.  <\/p><p> We need to encourage litigants to try mediation and the State can offer further support by opening up the courthouse facilities, which are empty on many days of the week, for mediation sessions where a case is already under way and has been adjourned to allow time for mediation. <\/p><p> The most important person or people in this process are the child or children.  The most appropriate way to hear the views of a child, on access, custody and guardianship, private law cases, is in child-inclusive mediation, with appropriately trained mediators.  A judge who is subsequently asked to rule or enforce any agreement resulting from mediation can then be satisfied that the views of the child have been heard.<\/p><p> The court needs a panel of child view experts immediately available, who can produce a report for the court within a reasonable timeframe.  If we operate a regional hub approach, then, rather than having a capped fee of &euro;250 or &euro;350, it may be more cost-effective for the State - I am all for saving money for the State - to have these child view experts on salary.<\/p><p> We should have parenting guidelines for judges based on international research, so that a child's right to have both parents in their lives is effectively prioritised. <\/p><p> In respect of parents, we need to ensure parity of treatment for both parents in our courts.  Non-resident parents are overwhelmingly fathers in Ireland, and their role as parents is generally not supported by the current approach of the courts.  Fathers are secondary or second-class parents as far as our court system is concerned.  Where access orders are unilaterally breached, enforcement must follow and it does not currently.  Sanctions are open to the court under the 2015 Act and should be consistently applied.  I have been in the District Court since 2017 and not once have I seen them applied. <\/p><p> I thank this committee for the opportunity to make a submission and my colleagues who contributed, Dr. Sinead Conneely, Shane Dempsey, Nuala Jackson and Marie Dennehy.  Three are here today and we are ready, willing and able to do what we can to help.  We will meet any member of the committee any time day or night because this is too urgent and will provide any assistance we can.

My colleagues, Dr. Sarah Fennell BL and Rachel Baldwin BL, are in attendance with me today and we will be happy to answer any questions the committee may have during the course of this meeting.  Between us we have more than 50 years' experience in family law.  Each of us has a particular area of expertise and that is why the three of us came today.  It is a vast area, no one person covers the entire gamut of current family law practice.  Our submission, which the committee has received, sets out our preliminary responses to the issues identified by the committee which it wishes to address.  I do not intend reading out that submission in full but I will draw the committee's attention to some key points within it and then take questions.<\/p> <p>  The Bar Council is strongly of the view that the expedient and efficient resolution of family law proceedings arising from relationship and marital breakdown is in the interests of children and the parties to the proceedings.  The delays currently experienced in family law proceedings increase difficulties and complications which arise in the context of relationship breakdown, marital or non-marital.  The District and Circuit Courts deal with most private family law litigation and as Dr. Coulter has said, childcare matters.  We have set out statistics from a Courts Service report of 2017 and the bulk of cases are District Court cases of very serious import to the parties involved.  The High Court is available to deal with more complex or urgent matters or where it is simply thought appropriate that the High Court hear the case where particular issues of law might arise.  In our experience this division works quite well and reflects the ability of different courts to administer justice within their spheres.<\/p> <p>  In Dublin, there are dedicated family law courts and while delays remain in the system, there are not the chronic delays that can be experienced in other parts of the country.  Outside Dublin, the number of days allocated to family law sittings can be quite limited which results in system clogging and long gaps between the institution of proceedings and their determination, or broken hearings of a day here and another day several weeks or months hence, which is not satisfactory for anyone, not even the court.  Regularly in Circuit and District Courts, family law proceedings can be listed alongside the general list of criminal and civil matters, which is far from satisfactory.  It is likely that family law cases would be dealt with more efficiently, were a specialist division of family law courts and judges to be created.  In our view this would ensure that the same judges would deal with the family law list on an ongoing basis which we believe would not only lead to greater efficiencies but also to greater consistency.  It is not envisaged that specialist judges would be confined to family law but they would be assigned from a pool of general judges.  Historically, there is nothing to indicate that because a practitioner practised in one area he or she could not adapt to being a judge in a different area.  Training in the contemporary world is the key.  Such a family law division exists de facto in Dublin and can operate within existing structures, without the need for a referendum, perhaps not even for legislation.  There may, in some circumstances, depending on how reform goes, be a need for legislation but I do not see the need for a referendum.  We suggest that the existing system can be made operate but any division is meaningless unless it is adequately resourced, as with all public services.<\/p> <p>  There is a lack of adequate facilities generally for the conduct of family law proceedings.  In the absence of a purpose-built family law complex in Dublin, applications are heard and determined in various locations which in general are unfit for use.  Current locations include childcare cases being dealt with in the District Court sitting at the Bridewell &ndash; the committee may be familiar with it, it is behind the Four Courts, beside the Bridewell Garda Station.  It is a 19th century building which was used, until it was revamped, for District Court criminal cases.  While it has been revamped it is still very unsuitable for the highly emotive, contentious issues involved in public childcare cases.  People are in very close proximity in inadequate facilities where emotions run very high.  In addition, most private family law cases in the District Court are dealt with in Dolphin House, which has been there for several decades.  It is an old hotel behind the Clarence Hotel, at the Parliament Street end of Temple Bar.  It was fine perhaps once upon a time but with the growth in the volume of cases it is chock-a-block.  My colleague, Rachel Baldwin, has more knowledge of this but in my memory, it was never very suitable and is totally unsuitable at the moment, notwithstanding the best efforts of individuals in the Courts Service to make it work.  The Circuit Family Court sits in Phoenix House in Smithfield.  That was a major improvement when it came in but once again, the volume grows, times have moved on and, while it is not bad, it is far from ideal. <\/p> <p>  Outside Dublin family law applications are heard in the existing District and Circuit Court locations on appointed days, as are Circuit Court appeals to the High Court.  Due to the fact that family law proceedings outside of Dublin are generally heard on specially fixed days, the applications will necessarily take place in courtrooms constructed in a different era for different purposes and are not particularly suitable for family law litigation.  They may be suitable for criminal cases involving juries, they may even be suitable for civil cases but they belong to a different era.  Even with the revamping programme that has taken place in my lifetime at the Bar, where a lot of money has been spent on redesigning courthouses, they are still far from ideal and there are never enough adequate consultation rooms or family-friendly spaces.  In short, it is not feasible in these venues, to have properly designed resources for family law cases because they only represent a portion of the business conducted in that courtroom.  That is a bit of a conundrum because while I talk about a specialist building in Dublin, which is big, outside Dublin a huge assessment is needed as to how to deal with this, whether regional centres of excellence, separate buildings or by hiving off part of an existing building.  It is a big job but it has to be addressed and some start has to be made on it.<\/p> <p>  The inconsistent resources in court venues and the lack of adequate consultation rooms, for example, directly impacts on the manner in which family law proceedings are conducted.  The failure to provide separate waiting areas or family-friendly spaces can significantly increase stress and anxiety, which would be avoidable prior to participating in a family law application.  It is even as simple as how does the lawyer consult properly with a client in privacy over sensitive issues, or sometimes less emotionally sensitive but personal financial issues.<\/p><p>It is very difficult.  These situations of extreme stress can result in volatility in the conduct of the litigation.  Everyone needs to remain calm, and it is probably the biggest criteria that is needed to run these cases.<\/p><p> As regards our view, certainly, in Dublin, I refer to the construction of the dedicated family law building at Hammond Lane.  The committee will be aware of it.  It is behind the Four Courts, on Church Street.  There is a site there which was to have built on it a purpose-built family law complex which would accommodate all the existing family law courts in Dublin and would also accommodate the children's criminal court.  It was a superb idea behind which the family lawyers, the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Family Lawyers Association threw whatever weight they had.  Unfortunately, it seems to be stuck and is going nowhere.  If it was built, and it needs to be built, it would go a long way towards addressing deficiencies in the current family law system, certainly, in the greater Dublin area.<\/p><p> In addition, we are acutely conscious that in modern times a properly functioning civil legal aid system is essential in providing access to justice.  As the committee can see from the statistics, and as I have stated already, the vast bulk of cases are District Court cases.  Significant numbers of people will be on legal aid.  Whatever about the rows about the means test and what level it should be set at and whatever about the good work that is done by individual solicitors within the Legal Aid Board and practitioners engaged by it, the system creaks along rather than works.  Again, it is back to resources.  This, in itself, causes delay in the court process where one party is on legal aid and another is not and there are delays because they are waiting to get their interview with the solicitor and they are waiting to get their legal aid certificate.  That has consequences for the entire running of the court system.  It might only be another five or ten minutes on each list, but if one multiplies that by several cases, one could easily lose half an hour or an hour of a day.  It can result in applications being brought by the other side, who may be privately funded, wanting to move it on, and the judge is trying to be sympathetic to the person getting legal aid and one gets costs built up as a result.  One needs a viable functioning legal aid system.<\/p><p> Finally - and, as I say, I am happy to take any questions - the areas touched upon throughout our submission simply demonstrate in an initial view how the administrative organisation of the court structure and improvement in court facilities can have a positive impact on how we manage family law and how we can expedite cases and, hopefully, reduce the cost of this to individuals over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":764,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in.

I need not remind the committee that the recent figures show that more than 30% of children or approximately 25,000 children a year are born now to parents who are unmarried.  This is a growing population of people whose rights are still very vague.<\/p> <p>  We have a particular issue in relation to the rights of unmarried fathers to guardianship of their children.  We believe that, first, as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, every child has the right to know who his or her parents, both father and mother, are; and second, has the right also to enjoy the company of both parents.  As other speakers have said, if one starts from that position one must take a different view of the interventions that are currently available for unmarried parents and their children.<\/p> <p>  I would now like to hand over to Mr. Peelo, our CEO, who will elaborate in more detail on some of these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Barrington"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":768,"content":"<p>Good morning.  <\/p> <p>  Treoir acknowledges that there have been far-reaching changes in family law over the past five years.  However, despite changes to the law, significant deficiencies exist in terms of how the system continues to operate and we deal with the consequences of this on a daily basis through our information service.<\/p> <p>  Two issues emerge in terms of the operation of the family court that we would like to highlight.  One is the lack of information in the public domain.  The second concerns access to legal advice and representation, and the question of economic inequality.<\/p> <p>  Twenty-five years ago, the Law Reform Commission report on the family law system noted that the structures for the mediation and resolution of family conflict were grossly inadequate.  Fast forward to today, and the family mediation service remains under-resourced with people waiting from 12 to 26 weeks to get an appointment.  Enough is not being done to ensure alternative dispute resolution, ADR, is properly resourced and available for parents, both pre-court and post-court.  The failure to properly resource dispute resolution means that Ireland lags far behind other countries in establishing and sustaining shared parenting.  As Dr. Barrington has said, Treoir believes all children have a right to know, to be loved by and to be cared for by both parents, where possible.  Shared parenting gives children the possibility of a nurturing relationship with both parents and their extended families and works well if it is child-focused, rather than adult-focused.<\/p> <p>  In the Republic of Ireland, conflict between unmarried parents is often exacerbated by the fact that unmarried fathers do not have automatic guardianship rights.  Even if his name is on the child's birth certificate, an unmarried father does not have rights in respect of his child and this creates inequality in terms of parental rights and responsibilities which often results in the parents going to court.  The adversarial route clogs up the courts and leads to tension and conflict between the parents.<\/p> <p>  Treoir is calling for automatic guardianship rights to be extended to unmarried fathers whose names are registered on the child's birth certificate.  This practice has been in force in Northern Ireland since 2002.  It would also mean that we would have a national register for guardianship.  When we think of our children and we talk about the future and children being our greatest asset, we do not have a system currently where we know who the guardians of children are.<\/p> <p>  I will say a little about the voice of the child.  In 2019, people on low income remain at a clear disadvantage when it comes to the family law system.  For example, those who qualify for legal aid must make a minimum contribution of &euro;130, which is a substantial amount of money if one is dependent on welfare or a low-paid worker.  This means that those who are less well-off often end up representing themselves in family law hearings.  This delays the process, places more pressure on an already struggling court system and causes increasing tension between the parties.<\/p> <p>  Inequality between those who have the financial means to hire legal representation and those who do not is replicated again when it comes to the voice of the child.  Article 42A.4.2&deg; of the Constitution enshrined the right of children to have their views heard in guardianship, adoption, custody and access proceedings.  Under the Children and Family Relationships Act  2015, the court has provision to appoint an expert to determine the views of a child or receive a report on any issues affecting that child.  A fundamental flaw of this provision is that parents, regardless of their financial means, must pay for that report.  People entitled to legal aid can get 50% of the expert report covered by the Legal Aid Board but it is still a substantial cost.  Treoir is concerned that many parents on low income are not able to afford this, with the result that the constitutional right of the child to be heard is seriously compromised.  Simply put, the lack of legal representation, the cost of the expert report and the socio-economic situation of parents have a considerable impact in determining access in full to the family law system.<\/p> <p>  I want to say a little more about the information deficit.  A recurring theme from our work is the lack of knowledge among the population about the family law system.<\/p><p> There is confusion about the meaning of guardianship and the extent and limits of people&rsquo;s rights concerning access, custody and maintenance.  More worryingly, Treoir has identified a significant gap in knowledge of family law among members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the legal profession, social workers and the Judiciary, as we have heard from other submissions.  This is compounded by a pronounced geographical variation in how the system operates, especially with regard to the haphazard use of a very important document called the statement of arrangement for a child.  We urge the committee to recommend that a circular be sent to all District Court judges emphasising the importance of this form and insisting that it is used.  It is a very specific form that allows the judge to have a history of the circumstances of both parents.<\/p><p> Treoir urges the Minister to introduce a national public campaign on these issues.  The Australian Government introduced such a campaign in a major review of family law in that jurisdiction.  It has proved to be very successful in informing members of the public about their rights.  In our submission we have listed five clear recommendations that Treoir believes will improve the family law system.  They include extending guardianship rights to fathers whose names are registered on children's birth certificates; ensuring that the family mediation service is properly resourced, a system of alternative dispute resolution is introduced and shared parenting supports are resourced; and introduction by the Minister of a national public information campaign on key issues such as access, custody, guardianship, birth registration and maintenance.  We also acknowledge that this terminology is outdated and needs to change. <\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.  We are happy to take any questions they may have and continue to work with this committee and the Department of Justice and Equality to improve the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Peelo, Dr. Barrington and all who have presented.

I commend her on the excellent work she does in reporting family law cases.  She said there should be a dedicated reporting body.  Is the child care law reporting project sufficient, or is something more than that needed? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#N00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":775,"content":"<p>We are a time-limited body.  We initially came into existence for five years.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs sought to extend that period to inform the review of the Child Care Act 1991.  After a competitive process, we were successful in obtaining that extension but our work is time-limited.  However, it is a model that works.  I recently had an opportunity to speak to child protection lawyers in England, where they are struggling to find a transparent system that works.  Various attempts to amend the law have not led to adequate transparency in the English system.  As each individual court determines what can and cannot be done, arguments as to what reporting can be done are sometimes completely separate from the child protection proceedings themselves.  This lengthens the proceedings.  It does not solve anything, and it leaves the courts and media organisations to struggle with the issue of anonymity and protecting families.<br\/><br\/>I would propose a national system which could be attached to the Courts Service.  As I said, the child care law reporting project is time-limited, so I am not talking about us.  Such a system would ensure there was a national protocol to protect anonymity and avoid issues like the geographic identification of the courts.  That is one of the dangers which exists at the moment.  For example, if a local newspaper reports on proceedings, the very best efforts of <i>The Clare Champion<\/i>in reporting a case in Ennis will not adequately protect a family's anonymity.  However, if we ensure that geographical details are redacted as well as identifying data on the family, then reporting can show how the process works in individual cases.  That model works very well.  It is now prompting some international interest.  A researcher is coming from the UK next week to look at how this model works to see if it could be transferred to other jurisdictions.  It has managed to avoid identifying families while providing information about what happens in the courts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Carol Coulter"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":776,"content":"<p>Who funds the child care law reporting project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#N00800","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Ms Corbett wishes to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#N00900","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I beg her pardon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#N01000","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":779,"content":"<p>To clarify, the child care law reporting project is only permitted to look at childcare proceedings, so just private family law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":780,"content":"<p>What about the other cases involving divorce or issues that do not involve a child?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#N01200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":781,"content":"<p>The project only concerns public family law and it is currently funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

In the pilot project we are carrying out in the south of the city, we are mediating domestic violence.  I will tell the committee why.  If we do not mediate domestic violence issues, we are saying that the alleged victim cannot choose to use mediation.  Moreover, the rest of the victim's life continues.  Access, maintenance and the rest of his or her life continue even when there is domestic violence.  I took my lead from a judge in Canada, Justice Geraldine Waldman, who set up a trial court in which the first part of the case involved hearing the criminal allegations of domestic violence.  In the second part of the case, the court heard evidence on the other issues to do with the family in question.  In other words, the first part concerned whether an assault or psychological violence took place.  Then the judge took off her gown and heard the second piece, which concerned maintenance or parenting issues.<\/p> <p>  I was in court on Monday watching cases in Dolphin House.  I took note of what one of the judges said to me, or rather to the litigants - because I am listening I always think I am being spoken to.  The father was 21 and the mother was 19.  The mother said that the father should not see the child because he was a criminal.  The judge asked the father questions and discovered that he had been in trouble when he was a young lad, as well as being in trouble now.  The judge said that the father having a criminal record or facing criminal sanction did not mean he stopped being a father or stopped seeing his child.  It is our job to figure out the circumstances that led to an allegation of domestic violence.<\/p><p> I want to be clear on one aspect of the Act.  As one of the relevant stakeholders with respect to the legislation, I fought on this issue but I was not heard.  I wear two hats in that I have my private practice and I carry out research.  My colleague, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Conneely, and I pointed out that section 3 excludes the application of the Act to mediation where domestic violence has taken place.  That is what it does.  It does not say that one cannot mediate where there is domestic violence.  It says the Act will not apply to mediation.  I had a conversation with the President of the District Court, Judge Rosemary Horgan, in a meeting with five judges and we spoke about this.  I gave my view and they appeared to agree with me.  The first findings of our research project that I will release will be on domestic violence.  We will release the findings in May.  We will look at allegations of domestic violence, how many of them exist, what is the evidence and what is the nature of them.  In Canada, domestic violence is broken up into 12 different categories.  We are doing this umbrella domestic violence piece.  Physical violence is fairly rare.  I worry that those who are genuinely suffering domestic violence are not coming into our courts.  We then have all the permutations of the break-up of a relationship such as arguing and fighting.  That is coming in as domestic violence when it is something different.  It can turn into domestic violence but, initially, it may not be that.  I was shocked to find that almost 16% of the domestic violence cases involve parents in their 50s and 60s seeking an order to put a son or daughter out of the house, particularly in Dublin, because he or she is assaulting them.  Drugs and alcohol are the two significant issues that are not dealt with by the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#N01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":787,"content":"<p>Dr. O'Shea believes mediation should still be available even if there are circumstances involving domestic violence or abuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#O00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":788,"content":"<p>Yes.

It is done case by case and judge by judge.  The regulations that came in this year, in respect of which issues relating to the fee applicable obviously arise, allow a court to order two types of reports, one of which is the voice of the child while the other is a question affecting the welfare of the child.  All judges will make decisions regarding access, guardianship and custody where the welfare of the child is paramount.  I think it was highlighted by someone else that this is child focused.  It is the child's right to have access, if appropriate, to his or her parents rather than the parents' rights.  There can be so much conflict between parents and, in my opinion and based on my experience, the majority of judges have said that this is about the child's right and not necessarily about the parent's right.  The problem was that when this Act came in, there was no guidance as to how this would be done and how it would be funded.  As was pointed out, it is to be funded by the parties.  The Legal Aid Board stepped up to a certain degree and it contributes when someone has a right to legal aid.  The fee is, however, completely inappropriate.  It is not proper for the type of report.  The difficulty is that if one just has the voice of the child, that does not necessarily take everything into account.  For example, there might be a case where the child has been exposed to conflict, be it domestic violence or just marital or non-marital breakdown or conflicts between parents, or there might be a case where the child has not been exposed, the parents have kept the child away and the child might have a particular view either way but it is not necessarily in the child's best interest for him or her to have access on certain days.  A lot is said about fathers' rights and that goes without question but it might not be in the child's best interests to have 3.5 days with either parent or both parents.  The child needs a degree of consistency.  Usually, if the child has a base, be it because of school, social activities or friends, he or she can see the other parent.  Obviously, work is also an issue if both parents work or one parent works.  A side issue that comes up, particularly in Dublin, might involve a case where the courts are more than willing to give overnight, mid-week or weekend access and the parents are agreeable to that but the parent who does not have the day-to-day primary care control of the child does not have the housing or the ability to provide overnight access.  That happens quite a lot.  There are no issues between the parents but, unfortunately, the accommodation is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Baldwin"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":792,"content":"<p>Dr. Fennell wishes to make a point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#O00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Following on from what Ms Baldwin said, we need to draw a distinction between public and private law cases in terms of the variety of mechanisms to hear the voice of the child because what is commonly utilised in public law proceedings is the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>procedure whereby that is not activated in family law proceedings.  It is on the Statute Book but it never commenced.  That was confirmed a number of years ago in the High Court.  There are a variety of mechanisms to include a guardian, depending on the nature of the case, in terms of public or private law.  Section 47 reports, as we traditionally know them, are available.  They can sometimes now be referred to a section 32-type report.  Sometimes the reports are used interchangeably.  They are different sections within the Act.<br\/><br\/>There is also provision to join children as parties to proceedings or to allow children to have their own independent legal representatives.  Those two mechanisms are used quite rarely.  The other mechanism would be that a judge would hear a child in chambers.  That is dependent on the particular judge.  Judicial guidelines from the High Court to guide judges in that respect are in place but it is left to the discretion of the individual judge as to whether that is appropriate or not.  I can only speak from my own experience, which would be primarily in the Circuit Court or High Court.  It is the section 47-type reports that are most commonly utilised and involve private law cases.  In the public law cases, it tends to be the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>procedure or judges may speak with the children in question in cases involving special care orders where teenage children will often be detained.

When I carried out my Circuit Court research I interviewed 15 of the judges.  I asked them where did the orders come from and it took nearly two years for me and these judges to figure it out.  What we figured out and learned was that these orders came from expert reports when a welfare issue was raised about a child.  Every second weekend and one night during the week was meant to be the least amount of time a non-resident parent would have with his or her child and not the norm.  What has happened is that all of our courts order that as the norm.  That is impacting on fathers and is a very serious issue.  How do we resolve this?  We provide parenting guidelines, which is what is done in other countries.  There are parenting guidelines in Canada that stipulate children who are under the age of five or six years should not be more than four days away from the other parent - the non-resident parent.  There should not be these big blocks of time.<\/p> <p>  Mediation is now court linked, under the Mediation Act 2017 that came in in January of last year.  In other words, if a case rocks up in court and the parties have not tried mediation then under section 16 of the Act a party to the proceedings can ask the judge to ask both of them to consider and to try mediation.  We have only just launched our project in Dublin and in the 50 cases that we did, the parenting time for the non-resident parent improved in all cases, and 80% of the fathers in the 50 cases did not have any access at all.  We could address the imbalance in parental rights by good, competent mediation linked to our courts because, under section 11 of the Mediation Act, the parties can now determine if a mediated agreement is legally binding and capable of enforcement.  Let us say there is a parenting agreement in mediation but somebody breaches it down the road, the case can be brought into the District Court really fast and the agreement enforced.  The judge has a really clear picture of a child's life.  He or she will know what time the child gets up at, goes to bed at and goes to see Mary at, when the child makes his or her communion and goes on holidays and what things the child does at Christmas, etc.  A mediator can map that out carefully and slowly based on the parents of the child but a judge cannot.

It is brilliant that they decided to come here because this is such an important area.  Our failure to deal with it, as a society, is so enormously damaging that there is an imperative on all of us to listen to the advice that we are being given, and act on same.  The saddest part is that some of the issues have been well flagged but have not been acted on for a period.  Some of my thoughts on this matter are a little bit eclectic, so I may throw out some stuff.  I will start with the whole area of listening to the voice of the child.  If we considered matters like that in a real sense then things might be different.  It would be a good starting point.  The Act in 2015 gave directions for an expert report to be done on the welfare of the child.  Recently, the Bar Council talked about some of the regulations and the experts being problematic not least, I think the witnesses said, on account of the maximum fee being set.  I would like to explore some of those things.<\/p> <p>  Why are the regulations problematic?  What is the issue with the maximum fee chargeable?  A maximum fee is a sensible suggestion.  I have heard of people paying thousands upon thousands of euro for section 47 reports.  Would it be better to cap them?  Would a State-funded scheme be better, as suggested by Dr. O'Shea?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the differences between section 47 reports under the 1995 Act and the section 32 reports under the 2015 Act.  Are they the same?  How do they differ?  How come section 32 reports can be compiled by psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and social care workers who have undergone specialist training while section 47 reports can be compiled by whoever the health board deems to be qualified?  This is a huge problem.  Is there a fee cap on section 32 reports?  I think there is a cap on them but not on the section 47 reports, which are more commonly used.  The reason for this is a lack of consistency.  Some judges sit down with the children and ascertain their views in a very nice, all encompassing way but most judges do not because they probably think that talking to children is hippy nonsense and a waste of time when he or she has too much work to do or whatever.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses think there is a limit in the Act?  The Act gave power or enacted the constitutional provision to recognise the voice of the child.  The Act only talks about the views of the child where they are ascertainable and that the court \"may\" does so.  Do the witnesses think the Act should be changed and the word \"shall\" inserted?  Should the voice be required because some judges do not listen to that voice?  In that context, there is a huge issue with the section 47 reports.  I have heard a lot of people say that it is not the voice of the child but the voice of the psychoanalyst, for example, who takes a certain view.  It is hugely problematic that this is an unregulated profession.  I have raised the case of psychoanalysts many times with the Minister.  It will be two years before the profession is fully analysed, so anybody can call himself or herself a psychoanalyst and, therefore, could be authorised to compile a section 47 report.<\/p><p>There is a gap in the law.  If I do not like a report, there is nowhere I can go to overturn it.  Is it the witnesses' experience that, even though the judge may take these reports into account, in practice they have become the gospel for many judges?  That is against the backdrop of there being no mechanism where a report can be appealed or complained about because it is an unregulated profession.  To me, that is an incredibly daunting and worrying situation.  I would like to hear comments on that and how we can improve the situation so the voice of the child can really be heard.  At the moment, as far as I am concerned, that is not being dealt with properly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#P01200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":811,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Coulter first, followed by Dr. O'Shea and Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in.

In public family law, overwhelmingly, it is the guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>who is meant to represent the voice of the child.  Guardians<i>ad litem<\/i>under the Child Care Act 1991, and the new Act dealing with <i>ad litem<\/i>which has not come into force yet, have two jobs.  One is to represent the views of the child and the other is to represent the welfare of the child.  Those may not necessarily be the same thing at all.  There is a great danger in that system that what we get is a guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>representing what he or she thinks to be in the welfare of the child and the views of the child get lost.<br\/><br\/>Children, of course, may not always be the best judges of their own long-term welfare but, nonetheless, their unfiltered and unadulterated views do need to get representation before the court.  I know there are many other issues in respect of private family law but this aspect needs to be clarified.  Having an opinion on the welfare of the child is different from presenting the views of the child.  It must be ensured that the views of the child are represented in an unfiltered way so that people are sure of what those views might be.  That could be done through the child's legal representation or through an expert or guardian. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Carol Coulter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":813,"content":"<p>First of all, our constitutional situation is not quite in keeping with the UN convention.  Under that convention, children in this State have a right for their views to be heard if they wish their views to be heard and not if we can ascertain them.  It does not relate to the capacity of the child but to his or her desire for his or her views to be heard.  A sanction note has already been sent to Ireland stating we are not compliant with the convention.  The issue is in respect of how we hear the voice of the child.  I brought ten Canadian judges to a conference here chaired by Mr. Justice McKechnie in 2010.  There were also four American judges and a couple from New Zealand.<\/p> <p>  The Canadian judges, in particular, were shocked that Irish judges were hearing the views of the child without appropriate training.  Judges in Canada are required to have continuous professional training every year on how to hear the voice of the child, how to know if there is estrangement and how to know if there is parental alienation and coaching going on.  The judges I interviewed often stated they were parents.  That is not the answer.  Being a parent does not make a person best placed to hear the views of a child and the complexity that may be involved.  <\/p> <p>  There is a difference in the area of private family law.  In that context, if there is legal aid, the report is paid for, to an extent.  Ms Nuala Jackson, in the Visitors Gallery, will confirm that.  If a person does not have legal aid I am seeing delays being caused.  I will be publishing on this later.  Those delays may be being caused strategically because people know the cost of these reports is so great.  The delays are still very long even going through legal aid.  I have seen what happens then, as recently as Monday.  Judges are hearing cases where months have gone by without a non-resident parent seeing the child.  The judge then finds there is estrangement because the child has not seen the father - invariably it is the fathers, unfortunately - for six, seven or eight months.  It is stated that it is not possible to go back to normal parenting then and estrangement will have to be the starting point.  Our screwed-up system has done that.  It is not even the parents themselves. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":814,"content":"<p>Before bringing in Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in, I have to do two things.

I will deal some on an historical and overarching level and then hand over to my colleagues.  The section 47 report originated in the Family Law Act 1995.  Interestingly, that section has never been commenced to operate in the District Courts, which always operated on a \"needs must\" basis over the years.  There was also a resourcing issue.  Judges of the District Court tended to find other ways around this issue by using sections in the Child Care Acts until the HSE, previously the health boards, complained their social workers were being utilised too much.<\/p> <p>  This area has, therefore, always operated as a poor relation.  In fairness to the assessors in section 47 cases in the Circuit and High Courts - which are mostly in the context of judicial separation or divorce cases and where all of these other issues relating to children form part of the overarching case -  they would generally have been from regulated professions such as child psychologists and child psychiatrists.  There were some occasions where other assessors were used.  Generally, however, there was a cohort of people whom the practitioners and the courts knew.  They were generally well regarded and provided very objective expert witness reports, as opposed to hired gun reports.<\/p> <p>  It would be unfair, therefore, to castigate the cohort of child psychologists and child psychiatrists who, in the main, did this.  There was a cost with that process and there was an inequality of arms.  There still is.  As Ms Jackson confirmed, the Legal Aid Board would not fund these cases at a proper commercial rate.  A person privately funding a case would be able to pay for the appropriate report.  Practitioners found that the Legal Aid Board, notwithstanding the best efforts of those working there, was parsimonious and reluctant to pay for a proper report.<\/p> <p>  I should state the same situation would apply if a person wanted a specialist accounting report or other specialist evidence.  It would be very hard for counsel acting on behalf of a client with legal aid to get the evidence.  They would always be on the back foot against a privately-funded person who could afford an accountant or child psychiatrist.  In general terms, however, those reports worked well.  The District Court did its own thing, relying on section 20 of the Childcare Act 1991 at one stage, until it was told to back off, but it did work reasonably well.  I do not think it is correct to state that system does not work.  It is an issue of cost.    <\/p> <p>  Regarding appeals, any decision of any court is amenable to an appeal.  A decision of a District Court judge could be appealed to the Circuit Court or a decision of a Circuit Court judge under section 47 could be appealed to the High Court.  I appreciate the report is still being dealt with and I accept it is difficult to overturn such reports.  On the few occasions when I can remember it occurring, it was more undermined by the research methodology used by the assessor rather than the findings.  It is, again, a question of commerciality.  Who is going to go to the cost of getting another child psychologist or child psychiatrist to counter the evidence of the assessor?  It becomes an expensive process but it can be done.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of strategic delay, I hear what Dr. O'Shea is saying and that does happen.  In reality, however, no matter what system we come up with and no matter what finds favour with the committee or the Oireachtas, there are always going to be statistical outliers.  In my experience, and probably that of my colleagues, most people do not engage in strategic delay.  They want to get the case done, their children looked after and to be able to move on with their lives.  In fairness, that is what courts try to do.  They try to get people to move on with their lives rather than spending forever looking back at yesteryear.  That is a positive thing to do and practitioners try to do that as well.  <\/p> <p>  The number of people, therefore, engaged in strategic delay is minimal and they will exist no matter what system is in place.  In our submission, many things are interrelated.  There is no suggestion that it is possible to fix one thing and let other things go.  That is why we state there must be judges with appropriate training.  I think we all agree on that.  Those judges should be in place for a particular period of time.  That could be for one or two years and 80:20, as Dr. O'Shea suggested, or full-time.  Then we will get consistency in respect of all issues.  I refer to the evaluation of strategic delay, reports and assessments and sanctions on people, whether in the context of cost sanctions or otherwise.<\/p><p>This is another complication in the family law arena that is very different from the general rule in civil law that costs follow the event.  It is not all bleak.  There is a structure and it can work very well but it requires consistency on the part of judges, practitioners and the experts coming in, and a functioning civil legal aid scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":820,"content":"<p>With regard to what Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in said on consistency, it is better if a judge has been dealing with a case for a period of time because sometimes the difficulty with a case is the view of the court and the judges regarding what they will or will not do.  There are circumstances where a court might adjourn a matter to allow a child to come in to convey his or her views and wishes but when it comes about the particular judge on the particular day may not necessarily want to do it or to put the child in that position.  It depends and there a lack of training and consistency on this.<br\/><br\/>To return to the question on section 32 reports, as Dr. Coulter pointed out, the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in the public law system looks at the views of child and his or her and welfare but they might not correspond with each other.  This is the difficulty we have with the section 32 reports.  Essentially, there are two reports.  There is one with the views and wishes of the child and another on the child's welfare.  The regulations themselves just deal with the voice of the child and this does not take in the overall issue.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the question on why the fees might not be proper it depends on the professionals and how they conduct themselves.  They might meet children with the mother or the father or, depending on the age of the child, they might meet the children by themselves, obviously brought by a parent.  They could do play therapy or speak to them directly, depending on the age.  Usually there are quite a few meetings and then the report must be written for the court.  Deputy Daly asked about questioning or appealing the reports.  If either or both sides are not happy with the report or have certain questions the professionals can be called to give evidence on this and to be cross-examined.  If there is something with which people are not happy or if something was not said the professionals can be asked their views, for example, on whether they would have a different view if a parent moved closer.  The professionals can be questioned and, as Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in stated, the reports can be appealed.<br\/><br\/>With regard to delays, the Act brings the views of the child into the case and this in itself will lead to delays because a case might be adjourned on the first day so the child can come in.  A case might also be adjourned to order a report.  These will cause delays but they are necessary delays.  Unless there is an overarching question about domestic violence a majority of judges will order an interim order on access.  This leads to delays but, in fairness to the courts, they try to manage it.  A case might be adjourned for a week for mention.  There might be three assessors with their various fees and information on how long they can do it and when they can start.  The judge will then put back the case for a couple of weeks or months to see whether the report has been done and when it has been done a hearing date will be set.  Judges micromanage.  This is from their own point of view without necessarily having training behind it.  They are trying to do their best with what they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Baldwin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":821,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Daly's question on the working of the section 47 report system, what regularly happens in court hearings is that if either side challenges the findings of a report the assessor will come to court to give evidence.  The assessor can be examined and cross-examined by the legal teams or the parties if they are not represented.  This is commonly done.  There certainly is case law that indicates the section 47 assessment is a tool in the overall process.  Judges should certainly not in any way be bound by it but it is a factor to take into consideration.<\/p> <p>  In endorsing the comments made on the need for specialist training for judges and assigning judges from a pool, I would indicate caution that we do not fall into the danger of looking at family law in a vacuum as if it is separate from other spheres of law.  Sometimes family law has a tendency to be viewed perhaps as a non-legal topic.  It is very legal and it is complex.  This is inevitable in many cases as it involves elements of constitutional law, EU law, international law, jurisdictional disputes, company law and pension law.  There are various elements to family law cases and we have to be careful that we do not try to separate it as a distinct sphere that is separate from other legal spheres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sarah Fennell"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I invite Deputy Daly to speak again and perhaps she will direct her questions specifically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#R00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I do not want to dwell on it.  Many of the points on section 47 must be seen in the overall context of the lack of training and all the other points that might address the deficit more so but I stick to my point that in the present scenario there is a power imbalance between the parents and the person who does the report.  This is just a fact from my experience.  A parent who does not agree with a report done by a psychoanalyst, which is not a regulated profession, cannot complain about the conduct of the person in dealing with the assessment.  That parent has nowhere to go.  Obviously, there are psychiatrists but some of these people are very well known by the courts.  If a report is done by such an individual and a parent must question it, he or she is on the back foot and is the neurotic mother or however the person has been portrayed.  The parent might not agree with it but he or she has nowhere to question it.  There is a power imbalance.<\/p> <p>  While I hear what has been said about selected delays, in my experience some people do so.  It is not that unusual.  It may not be in the majority of cases but some people try to drag it out and cause enormous hardship.<\/p> <p>  My list of questions is a bit eclectic because I do not want to repeat points that witnesses have made.  I want to tease out issues for myself.  Dr. O'Shea spoke about access cases and that there is no sanction for breaches of access.

I was asking why these sanctions are not popping in the court.  Dolphin House has 95% self representation so the staff in Dolphin House help litigants fill out the paperwork, which is a brilliant innovation.  This is really good but they are dancing a fine line of not giving legal advice while helping them fill out the paperwork.  People filling out the paperwork do not realise they should have filled out another form to state they wanted to come to court not only to deal with a breach of access but also to have a sanction imposed.  The sanction that exists under section 18A is compensatory time.  The judge may give parent who had been refused access longer periods of time to offset the adverse effects of the break in contact.  This is a sanction but it is a good sanction because it gives parenting time to the parent who lost out and extra time on top of it.<\/p> <p>  Fathers or mothers who must come to court to enforce their rights may be reimbursed for expenses incurred in trying to enforce their rights.  I have not seen that come up.  The judges tell me they are not sure how they might do that if it came in front of them.  In other words, are they reimbursing for the lost day of pay because of having to step away from the job for the day or are they paying for the bus, taxi or Luas fare to get to court?  The judge can also ask one or both parents to engage in family counselling, individual counselling, mediation or a parenting programme.  All these sanctions are for where one parent was unreasonably denied access based on existing court orders.  It is there.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, I went to the District Court because I thought I would start to see this.  This is what I was looking for.  However, we are now in 2019 and I have not seen it once.  We have had only 400 cases but in 400 cases I have not seen one application.  To put it in layman's language, it is like getting the ticket out of the machine when getting a tax disc but nobody is pulling the ticket.  A judge operates to the ticket that comes in.  People fill out a form that goes before the judge but the judge can deal only with the ticket in front of him or her.  If the person has not filled in a form to state he or she wants the judge to look at the sanctions, the judge cannot do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":825,"content":"<p>That is useful.

In other words, if the order provides for visitation on two weekends and once during the week they are not willing to agree to anything else.  There is very little room for negotiation especially if the parents are not getting on and they do not put the child at the centre.  We have found that there is a lack of information available to parents in terms of what they can do and the sanctions for which they can apply.  The other problem area is that of shared parenting.  It is a whole different philosophy and way of working.  It is not about the adults.  It is about the child and about how do they work collectively in the interests of the child.  We have found that parents who go down the shared parenting route are much more able to negotiate when there are breaches or when they have issues around access and so on.  They are much more willing to be flexible in terms of arrangements with each other.  We carried out research last October that examined the barriers to shared parenting.  The main issue is that people get stuck in the letter of the court ruling.  They think they cannot go beyond it and that they cannot renegotiate it even though it might not work for the child at different ages.  In other words, what is agreed in respect of a child at aged three might be different to what is needed at age six and again when the child is aged nine and so there is constant change in the lives of the parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":827,"content":"<p>The information piece is critical.  We hear constantly from women that because maintenance payments have not been made they are going to withhold visitation rights.  We always respond that under the court order, they cannot do that.  People sometimes do not realise that under the law, access is different to maintenance.  This is an issue internationally.  Most people are not lawyers and it is only when life circumstances happen that they find themselves in this context.  The Australian Government had a massive national public information campaign on this area which targeted the general population.  We are contacted daily by people who as sole guardians of a child go to a Garda station to have passport application forms signed and the Garda refuse to sign them.  In judges' decisions, a person might be a guardian of one child but not of another.  There is a lack of general understanding around the concepts.

It is about the day-to-day care and the language used around these concepts.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly mentioned the voice of the child.  One of our recommendations is in regard to the child statements of arrangement form.  It comprises 27 questions.  It is a requirement of the Child and Family Relationships Act.  The idea was that all judges at District Court level should be using this.  It asks a broad range of questions on issues to do with domestic violence, criminality and what other children are living in the house.  Lots of people have children by different parents and so the whole structure of the family is different.  This is meant to give the judges an overview of a particular family.  We have found that the form is being used in Dublin and Cork but outside of that, it is not being used.  In terms of District Court judges, this form should be compulsory, because it means they have to take time and look at the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Roche"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":828,"content":"<p>It should be noted that under an EU directive - the Brussels II bis directive - there is recognition and enforcement of family orders between European Union jurisdictions.

That is beginning to be an accepted definition of shared parenting.  We are a bit data-free at the moment but I will provide a statistic.

It must be borne in mind that alternative dispute resolution is not solely limited to mediation.  There is collaborative law which is not developing to any great extent at the moment and there can possibly be arbitration.  On that, the Bar Council is engaged in a pilot analysis with the Law Society and the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators to see if there are certain aspects of family law involving discrete issues which, without impeding on any constitutional boundaries, could be arbitrated to reduce costs and shorten cases.  That is in its early stages.  We have a dispute resolution centre at our premises in the Distillery Building on Church Street.  While it is mainly used at the moment by inquiries and commercial groups, it is there.  We spent money to fit it out and people can use it for mediation or arbitration in family law or any other area.  We are very open to that.  However, we are acutely conscious, with no disrespect to Dr. O'Shea who is an admirable person, that mediation is not a panacea.  This is a wide panoply of cases and the numbers are big.  There are a lot of family law cases where the parties will not be willing to engage in mediation.  One can try and one can introduce them to it, but mediation by definition requires two consenting parties.  Without that, mediation becomes another layer with an additional cost and a delay factor before one moves to the courts system or arbitration.  At least with arbitration and the courts system, there are defined processes.  In court, the judge can call the shots as may the arbitrator in an arbitration, albeit I accept that is limited in family law cases.

My colleagues would have greater experience of this than I have at this stage of my career, but my experience is that these situations are fraught, even if, as Dr. O'Shea says, rightly, it may not be a matter of demonstrable physical violence but of other types of abuse.  It is possibly dangerous.  The victim in the relationship could come out the worse, particularly in a mediation where the mediator is not a lawyer.  There is anecdotal evidence that mediation with a mediator and no lawyers can lead to the dominant spouse or partner engaging, in effect, in bullying during the mediation process.  Lawyer-assisted mediation is slightly different because each person has a protector.

Domestic violence certainly arises in child protection proceedings, as does child abuse sometimes.  However, what is involved then is that the State intervenes in a family to limit or remove constitutional rights from family members.  That is a totally different type of proceeding than private family law proceedings.  As I said earlier, it is not appropriate to use mediation there.  There is a second layer of issues that then arise in childcare proceedings where both parents may want to have access with their children and may have views about the children's education, health and so on.  Certainly, mediation is very important there.  Again, the domestic violence issue is unlikely to be one of the issues that features in that layer of consideration.  It is not always appropriate to ask a judge to decide whether a child goes to this school or that school when there could be a mediated discussion around it.  Equally, the issue of whether the Child and Family Agency allows access on a Wednesday or a Thursday is very suitable for mediation.

I know of no data anywhere in the world that would support what he said, namely, that there is proof that where there is a non-lawyer mediator scenario, there is bullying in the mediation process.  My view is that this is anecdotal.  If he can find the evidence, I am wide open to looking at it.  We are running a research project to tease this out and see if we can deal with domestic violence.  By domestic violence, we mean cases where there is an allegation of domestic violence, including psychological abuse, coercive control and physical violence.  It is a substantial area.  Where there are court orders to say that it is a result of physical violence, that may be screened out.  We screen clients before we even do the mediation but most cases where there are domestic violence allegations can be mediated.  Some 25% of the 50 cases we have addressed so far included domestic violence allegations.  We are not on our own in this dialogue.  It is happening in other countries which are trying to figure out how we do it best.<\/p> <p>  Drugs and alcohol are the two most significant issues that I see in the Circuit Court and the District Court, and the other problems flow from that, including domestic violence.  The mediator to whom Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in refers is a mediator who is doing a really bad job, who allows a power imbalance to happen and a dominant personality to in any way bully or control the process.  I am probably being a bit hard on Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in but the context probably justifies what he said.  The context is that in Ireland, we developed family mediation that is unique and different to any other jurisdiction that I looked at.  We began in the 1980s with a Catholic ethos, coming from the background of Accord, and we developed a form of family therapy mediation unique to this country.  We do some great stuff.  This was incredible in the 1980s.  No other country started off a state family mediation service.  We did it in Ireland.  It was incredibly innovative but it has not evolved enough.<\/p> <p>  What Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in probably feels is the norm, a process with two people being in the same room at the same time with a single mediator doing a form of family therapy allowing them to vent and address issues, is not the norm.  Our process is bi-gender and it is co-mediation.  There are male and female mediators so that men do not feel that women are all over the process.  There are separate mediations which we call parallel mediation.  When people are in conflict, one initially works with them separately.  We see them within ten days and try to get the first parenting agreement within another ten days.  That first parenting agreement is six weeks long because everybody stays in the fight or flight space and in those six weeks we try to tease out a test run.  Before they get to the end of the six weeks, we take them into a three-month period, then into a six-month period, then to here.  Each agreement evolves with the family.  Where there are domestic violence allegations, we try to figure it out.  Five of the 50 cases involved domestic violence allegations.  There were subsequently proceedings and an application was made.  Four made undertakings through the mediation process to the court where the judge accepted those undertakings.  An undertaking is where a person swears, on oath to the judge, to the same effect as a protection order or safety order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I will not open up a dialogue between the panel because our guests are engaging with the members.

At a very practical level, many young couples with low incomes who have a child have never lived together because they have no place to live together; she is with her family and he is with his family.  As a result, there is no question of that applying.  Even if they lived together, there is no formal registration of that guardianship because they can only be established through a statutory registration which is the property of one or both parents, but is not a public document; it is not a public record.  At a more fundamental level, we have a problem with that provision because, essentially, the criterion for guardianship is the relationship between the mother and the father - the three months cohabitation - not the relationship of the father to the child as would be the case if they were married.  We believe this is a deep injustice which should be rectified.<\/p> <p>  In the normal course of events, guardianship for unmarried fathers should kick in if they sign the birth register.  People may ask questions about domestic violence.  Domestic violence exists for married couples as well as for unmarried couples.  That should not be a criterion for denying a father guardianship rights over the child.  If there is abuse of those rights, then of course they should be removed, but the assumption should be that the father is the guardian of his child whether married or unmarried.  Treoir would like to see the law changed to recognise that right of unmarried fathers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#V01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Barrington"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":870,"content":"<p>Dr. O'Shea and Ms Corbett have indicated and I will come back to Mr. Peelo at the end.

In reply to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, it is not necessary for it to be in the legislation currently going through the Oireachtas.  Without getting too technical - because it gets very technical - there is a 1996 Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, known as the 1996 convention.  The UK will continue to apply that convention but, within the EU, Brussels II bis takes precedence.  If the UK is no longer in the EU, it will arguably not apply Brussels II legislation but it will apply the 1996 convention.  That will resolve many of the immediate issues until some form of bilateral arrangement between the UK and EU emerges.<\/p> <p>  It is not a cause for alarm bells.  It is a concern rather than a cause for alarm.  The issue might become more serious as the years roll on if the UK will not apply decisions of the ECJ and there may be a greater divergence.   There will probably be no great divergence for the first few months or maybe even years after Brexit between what will happen under the 1996 convention and Brussels II bis.  A divergence could emerge over time and cause a particular difficulty, more for this jurisdiction due to our close proximity and historical connections to the UK.<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of the transfer mechanism under Article 15 of Brussels II bis and the fact that jurisdiction lies with the habitual residence of the child but it can be otherwise in exceptional circumstances and there could be a transfer to a better placed court if conditions are met.  The 1996 convention will work out fine in the short term.  Following the UK's withdrawal, some parts of Brussels II bis will not apply.  <\/p> <p>  There is a 1980 convention for child abduction cases which is the other convention that was referred to.  It deals with the civil aspects of international child abduction.  There is again a broad similarity but there is something called a non-return order which ends the case under that convention whereas, under Brussels II bis, the court of the country where the child is residing must send the papers to the court of the country the child has been removed from and the second court can order the return of the child.  That is again a minority issue but the 1980 convention has that provision.  <\/p> <p>  There are issues.  The Department of Justice and Equality has examined this and there is a hope that, in the short term, any divergence will not be significant immediately, but, over time, divergence could emerge.  A connection has been built up because each jurisdiction has judges who deal in this area who do not wait to talk to each other by megaphone.  They phone and email each other.  There is direct contact between the judges with responsibility for this in each jurisdiction.  They have conferences and get to know each other so there is good rapport, particularly between Irish and UK judges when they can speak English to one another.  In the immediate term, good sense will probably prevail among the judiciary on both sides.  That is the importance of contact and connection rather than megaphone diplomacy.<\/p> <p>  A residual area where there could be problems is the enforcement of maintenance.  As I understand it, and I am subject to correction on this, there is not an avalanche of maintenance orders.  I would have thought the figure was higher but it may be 250 to 300 per year.  We are talking about approximately 20 or 25 a month.  There will be a short-term, immediate problem if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March but, as I understand it - again subject to correction - the Department of Justice and Equality is considering some form of statutory instrument which will resolve that.  It may not be there on 29 March but it will be there in May or June.<\/p> <p>  We will get over these issues.  Perhaps the committee will invite us back in a year or two, or there may have to be other legislation.  For the moment, it will not be plain sailing and there are concerns, but they can be dealt with in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":879,"content":"<p>There are two other indicators on this.

The Mediation Act sets the groundwork for where we are in this space but a mediation council is needed.  Someone who is thinking about using mediation, particularly coming from a conflict space the Senator is talking about, needs to know the competency of a mediator, the training standards of the mediator, and that there is a complaints procedure and that there is somewhere the person can go if the mediator does a bad job.  If they meet Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in's mediator, the one that allowed the bullying, in all seriousness, they need to have a forum where they can make a complaint about the negligent behaviour of that mediator.  It is important.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to what I said at the start.  The earliest intervention possible - Senator Black hit the nail on the head - is exactly how we should be thinking.  If families know that the State has support systems, they will think they will go to this mediator immediately.  In the State sector, they go to the FRC, and the mediator starts working with them and sees addiction problems or mental health problems.  Mental health is popping up in many of the cases I am working with.  Then that mediator can reach out within the FRC and organise for that family, parent or child to get that support in the centre's rainbow of resources.  I love the way Senator Black phrased it.  When one helps people that early, it stops the conflict beginning to get legs and walk.<\/p> <p>  One of the pieces here is that we all know that people do not want to be in conflict.  What I would disagree on is that once people get into the war zone of the court system - I did myself - one goes to war, one is encouraged to stay at war and one will keep fighting.  I did; I will hold my hand up.  What we have to do is try.<\/p> <p>  This discussion is about reforming the family law courts.  I reiterate that we are starting the conversation at the wrong place.  We start with how do we keep people out of the family law courts and how do we keep them appropriate supports.

First, Senator Black asked how can we do it better and how are we here.  I refer back to where we started in the proceedings, which was the need for a specialist court.  Most other jurisdictions have a specialist court for child protection.  We talked about facilities and buildings.  However, if we can put that aside for a minute and think about the management of the system, a unified common system approach in child and family cases, both private and public, would make a significant difference because common rules would be applicable  in those courts.  At present, the District Court comprises 24 separate districts with their own rules.  Having multiple courts within them, these are 24 districts with their own set of rules.  Good practice that may exist in one place is not transferred to another.  A common set of rules operating across the system would make a big difference and would address some of the delays that we see.  It is not necessary delay, but duplication.  One will have a hearing on the same issue across the country.  Continually, the issues are being re-litigated.  Issues such as access to Garda DVDs in evidence and how to deal with hearsay evidence are constantly re-litigated because it is operating at the District Court level.<\/p> <p>  If there was a common unified court system, cases could be moved from the District Court to a higher court when necessary.  In the work that the child care law project did on complex cases, one could clearly see that the District Court was not equipped, both in terms of its rules in terms of discovery and other rules.  It did not have the time.  Those cases should have brought up.  I am thinking, in particular, of cases relating to child sexual abuse allegations or other cases where many experts are brought in and assessments are needed.  I suppose one aspect is to go back to that.  The unified approach with a flexibility within the court structure would make a significant difference.<\/p> <p>  The other point is slightly separate.  We have talked a lot about early intervention preventing people getting to court but in the child protection area, getting children from care back home is important.  One of the examples of good practice in other jurisdictions is a family drug and alcohol court.  The idea is that often if a child goes into care, the core issue in the family is an addiction issue, and the likelihood of reunification is not strong.  To improve the likelihood of reunification, one works with the parent on his or her addiction issues.  A different model is introduced.  It is more a therapeutic-judicial model where the judge and the parent engage on the parent's addiction with the goal of getting the child back home.  I merely bring that to the committee's attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#X01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":895,"content":"<p>Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in is next.

There are aspects of the system - I use the word \"system\" as the Chairman has said - but it is a vast system covering the whole country and covering all ranges of people's lives.  That is what makes the family system somewhat different, perhaps even from the criminal system.  One gets involved in every aspect of the person's life, not only the child-related issues but also the person's financial, company law, pension and housing issues.  As was said earlier, a holistic approach is required.<\/p> <p>  There are problems but they are mainly down to resources because the system operates on close to a shoestring.  I appreciate we had a bad recession ten years ago but I would have thought that at this stage we could consider investing more money in it.<\/p> <p>  We all seem to agree specialist judges with specialist training are needed.  It is the one need that seems to be agreed.  However, one need not necessarily spend all one's money on a new panoply of courts, judges and registrars.  One needs the personnel but one has an existing structure which works quite well.  In terms of the District Court, it has its rules.  The Circuit Court has its rules.  The reason we have a High Court is that it will define the law.  Life is dynamic.  The family law system is no different.  One will not be able to write the rule book for all occasions.  It is good to write the rule book but one must have cases going up to a High Court or even beyond so that it can state what happens in this area.  For example, the Oireachtas passed legislation in 2010 governing civil partnership and cohabitation.<\/p><p>The problem with the cohabitation legislation - and if Ms Nuala Jackson was allowed to speak she would agree - is that there has been no analysis by the higher courts of what is to be done and how one applies the sections of that Act in deciding what type of compensatory maintenance or property adjustment order should be made if the court finds there is cohabitation and a financial dependency.  That is a problem for the Circuit Court and for practitioners.  While most cases might happen at lower court level, one needs the higher courts to set the law, and the structure historically works.  Otherwise, all the District Courts and Circuit Courts will come at it differently.  We have that structure.  It is not so much a case of if something is not broken one does not fix it as that one does not necessarily have to reinvent the wheel.  I am not saying that a tweak is required.  It requires substantial resources and it is necessary to write new rules and train people.  However, it can be done with resources within the existing structure.<\/p><p> In fairness to the personnel of the Courts Service and judges at all levels, most of them work very hard to provide some service.  It is difficult with the burden that is placed on them.  That is particularly true of judges and civil servants in the District Court.  The burden placed on them is enormous and, with no disrespect to the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas keeps giving them more functions.  If one is going to give people more functions, one has to provide more resources.<\/p><p> With regard to mediation, we all agree that we need to weed out bad mediators.  At last we have a Mediation Act.  As Dr. O'Shea said, there is now movement towards the establishment of the mediation council, which will produce codes of conduct for mediators.

In theory, the length of the court day is six hours, so it is not necessary to be a mathematician to work that out as three minutes per case.  The crowding in some places is unbelievable.  That is not universal and, in Dublin, it certainly works much better.  It is just cannot be possible to devote adequate attention to all of the cases, even if many of them are adjournments, for mention and other technical things that have to be done.<\/p> <p>  There is a need in the District Court for resources to be put into case management so cases can be planned, people know when they are coming up, and they know the documents they must have and the reports that must be in.  In a handful of courts around the country, judges attempt to do that, but they are in a minority.  That goes back to the first question the Senator asked, as to why we are here.  Family law has been the poor relation of the legal system for far too long.  It does not involve crime, which gets headlines in the newspapers, or money and commercial transactions, by and large, and those cases, rather than the welfare of families, have been prioritised in our court system through the decades.<\/p> <p>  It is more than 20 years since the Courts Service's special committee, headed by the former Chief Justice, Susan Denham, recommended a family court, which means not a physical structure but an organisational structure.  That would allow for coherence, specialist judges, as we keep saying, and case management.  It would mean that if a decision is made about the hearsay evidence from a child in a District Court, or preferably if it is made by the High Court as to how it happens, one will not be going back to a situation where every time the issue arises in Donegal, Limerick, Dublin and so forth there are a couple of days devoted to arguing about it all over again.  That type of coherence must be brought into the system.  It has been sought repeatedly.  I understand the heads of a Bill are lurking or are in preparation.  I appeal to all the members, as legislators, to push the Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality to bring forward what is in process in the Department and ensure it is enacted as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Carol Coulter"},{"type":"speech","time":1551862800,"counter":902,"content":"<p>There are many legislative measures lurking around this place.

While it was purchased 20 years ago by the OPW, it came into the ownership of the Courts Service in 2015 or 2016.  Family lawyers in the childcare area were prevailed upon to move into the Bridewell courts as a temporary measure, much against their better inclination, because they were told they would be in Hammond Lane by 2021 or 2022 at the latest.

We have made representations on the issue directly to the Courts Service, but we have not gone beyond that.  We have tried to deal with it in a positive way and I hope it will happen.  We have not gone shouting and roaring, but that is where we must go next in lobbying the relevant Ministers.  It is a vacant site and if it is only finance that is stopping it - I do not want to overstep my position - surely the money could be found somewhere to build what would be a very important structure.  It would be the facility for family law in the Dublin area for a long time to come, a century at least, but the project has definitely stalled, as there has been no progress.  This means that the other buildings which were starved of funding in the recession and in anticipation of the Hammond Lane building being constructed are getting worse, particularly in terms of overcrowding.  We are at crisis point in respect of the Hammond Lane building.<\/p><p> I do not have figures for the Deputy for the civil Legal Aid Board as we have not carried out a cost analysis, but it is clear that the solicitors and administrative staff of the Legal Aid Board cannot cope with the current volume.

However, it has been interpreted, particularly by the Child and Family Agency, in an overly strict way in terms of access to information, particularly the kind of information from specialist research institutions such as universities.  The Act introduced in 2007 specifically allowed a number of nominated bodies to attend family law courts and report on family law cases, subject to the anonymity provision.  That did not extend outside the courts, for example, such that if any work needed to be done of a research nature involving children in care specifically, it was not covered by the legislation.

A start could be made in one area.  When Deputy Burton was the Minister with responsibility for social welfare, she oversaw the passing of the Civil Registration Act 2014 that provided for the father to be named on every birth certificate.  The legislation was passed, but the provision has not been commenced.  I understand the General Registry Office has argued it does not have the resources to do it, but this is the last country in western Europe without the requirement that the father's name be on the birth certificate of a child.  In a very concrete way, a step could be taken to recognise the rights of all fathers with respect to their children.  We argue we should go a step further, but that would require legislation.  I am referring to making the person registered as the father of a child his or her automatic guardian, unless there are circumstances that suggest he is unfit to be such a guardian.  Steps could be taken without legislation, but ultimately some new legislation would be required.  This is the place where such initiatives must be taken.  I know about the backlog and difficulties, but clearly other legal steps must be taken to improve the functioning of family court services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019030600002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Barrington"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551862800,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I appreciate that things can move slowly, but sometimes that is for a good reason, while at other times it is not.  Much could be done with the family law system that would not require legislation.  To a large extent, that is the undercurrent of the Bar Council of Ireland's submission.  There is a requirement for the Government to decide to spend money on this, but, unfortunately, in the world in which we live, money is always tight.  Nevertheless, it needs to happen.  Without boring the committee, I again argue that the facility on Hammond Lane must be built now, not in five or ten years.  It would not just comprise courts as it would also have family-friendly spaces, spaces for mediation and the Legal Aid Board.  It would have areas for social workers, as well as play areas and caf&eacute;s.  It would be a properly functioning environment and must be built.<\/p> <p>  In Dublin and perhaps Cork the presidents of the various courts more or less identify areas and judges self-select.  As a result, we tend to get judges who want to work in particular areas.  I am not saying I would be any better, but there is a need for training for the people concerned.  It is not that they are bad in themselves, as most of them are very good at what they do, but resources must be applied to provide specialist training.  The judges must be left in an area for two years, whether it be under the 80:20 rule mentioned by Dr. O'Shea or 100% of the time.  That would bring consistency, which is key in my experience of litigation.  If the practitioners know where judges are going, they can advise their clients accordingly.<\/p><p>Unless the judge is not applying the law, such that one has to appeal, there is a much more streamlined approach, there are fewer time delays and there are fewer trials running to see what a particular judge will do with this topic.  That can be done without money but one does need training.  Training takes time and money but the Hammond Lane building must be built.<\/p><p> Beyond that, it is difficult to know.  I do not want to be Dublin-centric or Cork-centric but once one leaves Dublin and Cork, it is a much bigger issue that probably requires far more extensive analysis of whether existing court buildings could be used more efficiently for courts and mediation services or whether time and money must be spent building new buildings.  I hope this would not be necessary and that the money could be spent on existing facilities, whose use and the personnel within them could be maximised.  In Dublin and Cork, this could all be done very fast if the Hammond Lane building is built.  I appreciate that would involve a time lag.  Outside Dublin and Cork, it would probably be slower but it would not have to take forever.  It might take a year but it could be got up and running.

Our politicians are actually doing a good job.  Does anybody normally say that?  It is the truth.  A good job is being done here on the family law legislation that is needed.  What is happening is that the core systems &mdash; those big systems &mdash; take time to change.<\/p> <p>  Let me outline the sea change we have to see.  I am not criticising the legal profession because it has a key role but it is a very old institution.  The public is very used to the idea of going to legal professionals when they get into trouble.

It was because I thought I felt protected.  Why did I feel protected?  I am referring to what brought me here.

We and those who also gave testimony should try to set out a very short checklist of what we believe politicians could do right now.  I am on the board of the Mediators' Institute of Ireland.

The experience of other countries has been that where the media are permitted to attend family law proceedings, which is the case in a large number of countries, there remains very little coverage and no comprehensive coverage of family law proceedings in a balanced way.  This is because the media tend to focus on high-profile cases where, if permitted, they can identify the families if they have a particularly high profile or if they are celebrities.  The bread and butter family law proceedings, which are what most people experience, never get reported by the media in general.  Only a small selection of judgments are published; the vast majority of happenings are not necessarily covered.  This relates to the issue of information, which was raised by Treoir.  It means information is not readily available.  I am happy there is now some international interest.  The model has been developed through a series of accidents.  A paper on this on our website describes how our project came into being.<\/p><p>It is able not only to publish reports so that cases from the general public are described on a website accessible to everybody but also to collect data that can be the raw material for research to examine trends and developments which we hope will lead to recommendations.  As to what further mechanism might be used to ensure that can continue after the end of our project in two years' time and which only deals with child protection, I hope it would be an integral part of legislation providing for a family court in order that transparency could be assured within any new family court.  Apart from anything else, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the jurisprudence from that, requires that there be accountability, particularly where the State is involved in family proceedings so that it is not allowed to take action in respect of families without people being aware of what is happening.

Today I am asking members to support an amendment to the Dormant Accounts Act to place an obligation on banks to give back property that is being held in safekeeping on behalf of deceased Irish citizens.<\/p> <p>  I first became aware of safekeeping in the 1990s when I worked in the Bank of Ireland group.  I will start by recalibrating the committee's perception of safekeeping.  If members are anything like me, when they think of the term safekeeping, they imagine a vault with rows of safety deposit boxes, each requiring two keys to open.  That is not how it worked.  In 1907, if one had an item that one wanted to lodge for safekeeping, one would package the item and give it to the bank manager.  It is important to note that the bank manager did not know what was in the package.  He or she would simply note the deposit in the safekeeping register, issue a receipt and place the envelope, package or box in the safe alongside all of the other items.  That is what took me by surprise when I came to work in the Bank of Ireland in Rathmines in 1993 and started to ask questions about all of the envelopes, parcels and boxes in the safe there.  One could tell by their shape what was in some packages, paintings for example, but one would have no idea what was in the majority. <\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland in Rathmines opened its doors in 1907 and the bank is still holding hundreds of items from that time onwards.  When I pointed out to the manager that it is entirely likely that the original customers are now deceased, his reaction was simply that his job was to keep the items safe and that they were safe.  Therein lies the opportunity with safekeeping.  At their height, Bank of Ireland and AIB had over 700 bank branches between them and every single one of those had a vault and every single vault held items for safekeeping.  Every city, town and borough throughout Ireland has potential beneficiaries of this property.  However, it is not only specific citizens who would benefit from a change in policy in this area.  The historic and cultural richness of this property cannot be underestimated.  Banks in Ireland have provided safekeeping services ever since they have operated as banks and much of the property they now hold is up to 200 years old.  When one pauses to consider that any item that was deposited for safekeeping was of sufficiently significant monetary or sentimental value to warrant the protection afforded by a bank, one must assume that this property now represents a vast reservoir of our own culture and heritage. <\/p> <p>  Members are probably keen to understand what types of property are held in bank vaults and I can give them a first-hand account based on my own experience.  I have seen paintings that are so large they are held on pallets.  I have seen single envelopes inscribed with the words &ldquo;to be opened on my death&rdquo;, which could contain someone&rsquo;s last will and testament, a deed, a confession or a share certificate.  I have seen currency, antiques, weapons and war memorabilia.  Even Charlie McCreevy speculated in the original debates on the dormant accounts legislation that banks could be holding the proceeds of bank robberies in their own safes.  We must not lose sight of the fact that the majority of this property is unknown.  The knowledge I possess comes from a small number of items that were opened in extremely concessionary circumstances or a result of damage to the container itself. <\/p> <p>  The question arises as to who owns this property now.  The legal position is explicit.  The property remains part of the estate of the original deposit maker.  For those items that are supported by clear records, there undoubtedly would be a huge effort involved in locating current beneficiaries and I will comment later on how this effort can be curtailed.  However in many cases, especially for older deposits, the bank records are at best, vague or at worst, non-existent.  Legal advice would suggest that where there is no clear evidence of ownership outside of the item, it is appropriate to open it to see if ownership can be established from the contents.  If it is not possible to establish ownership after this exercise, then the property would vest in the State under various statutory instruments, most notably the National Monuments Act and the Succession Act.  All of this is irrelevant because at present, there is no active appetite from the banking fraternity to address or engage with this issue, which is understandable given some of the legal exposures it presents for banks.  The elephant in the room with regard to this property rests in the fact that numerous estates have been settled after receiving erroneous confirmation from banks regarding the accounts they held.  On the death of a client, it is routine practice for their legal representatives to establish the asset base and in a banking context, this would take the form of a request for detail of that client's bank accounts.  In many cases the bank may not have captured the item in safekeeping and were it to now to reunite such an item with the beneficiaries of an estate, this would give rise to issues of underpayment of capital acquisitions tax, penalties and interest.  It also raises questions of proper succession, given that we are in the realms of property being passed through numerous generations and numerous estates.  <\/p> <p>  Despite the legal complexities, my own research has led me to form the view that there never has been any legal impediment to banks dealing with this property voluntarily.  However, it is clear that there needs to be some form of legal impetus compelling banks to act and the most appropriate instrument to use is the Dormant Accounts Act.  Careful consideration, however, must be given to the manner in which the legal obligations are introduced.  I tentatively suggest that any amendment should aim to satisfy three specific criteria.  First, we must acknowledge that although the banks own this problem, they did not intentionally create it.  As such, some form of amnesty should be granted insulating them from action arising from their non-engagement.  Second, the legal complexities are likely to be considerably more onerous for property deposited after the creation of the Irish State and as such I would propose that the dormancy period of 15 years set out in the current Act be extended to 100 years in any amendment pertaining to this property.  Third, many of these deposits will be currency and other monetary chattels such as gold bullion, Krugerrands and so on, which is capable of being converted to currency and ultimately given back, should a claim ever be made.  We also need to be cognisant of the fact that much of this property will be of cultural and historic value and should not be disposed of and in that context, the amendment should empower the State to take possession of these items.  It is worth mentioning that although this property is largely safe, we are already at risk of losing some as there is evidence that Danske Bank has moved up to 2,000 safekeeping items out of the Irish State, potentially beyond the reach of any domestic legislation.  <\/p> <p>  I will leave the committee with a description of one item.  This item, a chest, is held in the vault in the Bank of Ireland branch in College Green.  It sits on a shelf alongside thousands of other items.  The chest is slightly smaller than the rectangular coal bucket most of us would have had in our family homes.  It has a domed roof and a large cast iron lock, which secures a length of metal chain that wraps all sides of the chest.<\/p><p>Rope is woven through the links of the chain, intermittently knotted.  There is candle wax on the knots.  This item was deposited for safekeeping in the 1870s and nobody knows what it contains.  Members can let their minds wander.  They will find it hard to convince me that, whatever it contains, it will not change or perhaps mould our view of history.  This is not Pandora&rsquo;s box.  This is our heritage, boxed off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":942,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Connolly.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Stephen Brady, who also works with the finance and evaluation unit in the Department.  We have been invited here today on the topic of abandoned safety deposit boxes and the law, and we are here in the context of our role in the administration of the Dormant Accounts Fund.<\/p> <p>  The Dormant Account Acts cover accounts with banks, building societies and An Post, along with certain life assurance policies.  Under the Acts, an account is defined as dormant when there have been no customer-initiated transactions for 15 years.  If this has occurred, the institution must write to the customer giving them until 31 March of the following year to reactivate the account.  If the account is not reactivated, the funds are transferred from the bank or other institution to the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is managed by the NTMA.  However, the legislation guarantees the right of the account holders, or their next of kin, to reclaim the funds at any time in the future.<\/p> <p>  While the funds can be reclaimed at any time, the legislation also provides for the disbursement of funds that are not likely to be reclaimed.  The funds can be utilised for measures aimed at addressing social, economic and educational disadvantage or supporting people with a disability.  To achieve this, the legislation provides for the production of three-year disbursement schemes and subsequent annual action plans.  The annual action plans identify the measures across Departments that are to be funded from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  The responsibility for producing these disbursement schemes and annual actions plans currently rests with the Minister for Rural and Community Development and is delegated to the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the use of money in the Dormant Accounts Fund, last year &euro;28 million was disbursed from the fund to support a range of measures.  As previously noted, these are delivered across Departments and include, for example, investment in sports facilities and sport programmes, support for carers and investment in social enterprise and social innovation.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth noting that the Acts require a review to be carried out on a three-yearly basis.  The Department completed and published such a review in July 2018.  The focus of that review was very much on ensuring the efficient and effective use of moneys in the fund for the purposes provided for in the legislation.  However, the review also commits to carrying out research on the potential to supplement the fund from additional sources, and we will be commissioning that research as part of the implementation of the review.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the total value of the Dormant Accounts Fund, at the end of 2018 there was a total of &euro;290 million in the fund.  Of this, the NTMA has set aside a reserve of &euro;88 million to ensure the availability of funds for those seeking to reclaim their money from the fund.  There are also outstanding commitments to support measures amounting to &euro;56 million, that is, to support measures already approved by Ministers.  There is, therefore, some &euro;146 million remaining for use on projects and programmes under future action plans.  However, as the money in the fund remains the property of account holders or their next of kin, the use of money from the Dormant Accounts Fund adds to Government debt and is, therefore, treated in exactly the same way as any other Government expenditure.  Therefore, increasing the overall value of the fund does not necessarily mean that there can be additional expenditure in any given year.<\/p> <p>  To conclude on the matter of direct concern to the committee today, that is, abandoned safety deposit boxes, we have been forwarded two papers on the issue by this committee.  The first was by Mr. Jim Connolly and the second was a legal opinion on the matter.  The matters raised in both documents, in our view, relate mainly to issues such as ensuring the registration of safety deposit boxes, ensuring records are sufficient to be able to contact beneficial owners and ensuring some dating of access to these boxes.  These matters relate mainly to the issue of how safety deposit boxes are regulated and how banks and other institutions should apply any such regulation.  We plan to include this as an area for specific consideration in the forthcoming research into potential additional sources of funding, and today&rsquo;s discussions will inform how we progress that work.  However, as I noted, there are significant resources within the fund at the moment and the Department's immediate priority is to ensure the effective use of those resources within the fund.  In this regard, the Department is continuing to address the recommendations made in the review of July 2018.  I would be happy to assist the committee with any questions it may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Jordan"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":944,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jordan.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Fidelma Cotter, and we look forward to hearing the committee&rsquo;s analysis of the issue.  As per the committee&rsquo;s correspondence, the lead Department in regard to the Dormant Accounts Act is the Department of Rural and Community Development, so that Department will lead on any amendments to the Act.  The Department of Finance will feed into possible amendments as part of the normal Government decision making process.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance's analysis is that the provision of safety deposit boxes is not at this time a regulated activity and, as such, neither the Department nor the Central Bank have detailed information on these activities.  Given the limited information available, the Department welcomes any analysis that the committee can make available.  To be of assistance in advance of its analysis being provided, I will briefly set out the primary rationale for financial regulation and supervision under the Central Bank Acts, which has two overarching objectives.  The first is to protect consumers, given the complexity of financial products and services and the significant informational advantages that financial service providers have compared with the average consumer.  The second is to protect financial stability and the wider economy, given the substantial negative employment and economic impacts from financial instability events.<\/p> <p>  Based on these core principles of financial regulation and supervision, it is difficult to justify the regulation of safety deposit boxes from either a financial consumer protection or financial stability standpoint.  This is because, first, safety deposit boxes are a very simple product that all customers can comprehend and, essentially, there are no significant information asymmetries in favour of the provider of the product.  Second, safety deposit boxes do not provide a financial stability risk as there is no ability for the providers of the service to leverage the contents of the boxes.  If they were doing so, they would fall within the definition of providing a banking service and, as such, would be regulated.<\/p> <p>  In the event of legislative proposals on this matter, it is likely there will be cost implications for either the State or the private sector and, as such, a cost-benefit analysis must be conducted.  Obviously, given the multiple competing pressures on public funds, any costs to the Exchequer from proposals must be considered as part of the annual Estimates process in comparison with all Government social and economic programmes.  If costs are to be imposed on the private sector, a clear policy and principles rationale will be required to justify legislative changes that have cost implications for that sector.  It is vital that the benefit to the common good is clearly articulated and, preferably, quantified.<\/p> <p>  As set out in the Secretary General&rsquo;s letter to the joint committee, there is a significant difference between dormant accounts - and similar assets such as unclaimed life assurance policies - and abandoned safety deposit boxes.  The existence of dormant accounts in banks is generally of significant benefit to banks as these dormant accounts offer perpetual liquidity to the bank, which is a very significant benefit especially in periods of financial stress, whereas the maintenance of dormant safe deposit boxes is generally a cost to banks, as they must incur the cost of maintaining the deposits for no benefit, or a minimal cross-selling benefit.<\/p> <p>  The benefits arising to banks, as opposed to the State, from dormant accounts was a key rationale for the Dormant Accounts Act, which brought these accounts under the management of the State for use in community development projects but also ensured repayment of the accounts if the owner or the owner's successors were subsequently identified.  However, the inverse of that policy rationale would apply for safety deposit boxes, which are a significant cost to the holder and would also be a cost for the State if they were to be taken into State ownership.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of additional interlinked factors that require careful consideration in regard to any proposal to bring assets in safety deposit boxes within the remit of the Dormant Accounts Fund or to make the assets subject to statutory reporting.  One factor is insufficient information.  There is no information available to the Department or the Central Bank on the possible contents of safety deposit boxes in existence throughout the banking sector, or possibly the wider storage sectors.  This makes it very difficult to accurately quantify the number of assets that could be covered by the extension of the Dormant Accounts Fund and the likely cost implications for the State or private parties or both.  A second factor is the protection of delicate contents.  The National Archives and National Museum will be better positioned to advise on how best to open and review the contents of these boxes or the stores where they are held, given the passage of time will mean the majority of these assets may be in poor condition.  In addition, the potential transfer or cataloguing or both of these assets on the basis of a State instruction could cause damage, thus potentially making the State liable for any compensation.  The third factor is multiple asset classes.  The contents of these deposit boxes could be a wide variety of assets, as opposed to solely &ldquo;money-deposits&rdquo;, which is currently the asset class covered by the Dormant Accounts Act in terms of deposits and life assurance policies.  The variety of assets would dramatically increase the administration costs for any extension of the Act as the assets will likely be physical assets that must be carefully handled, valued and stored, as opposed to merely deposits or cash, which is a single asset class and a store of value.  In addition, in the event of people coming forward to claim assets, the State can always pay out deposits.<\/p><p>If, however, the State was to sell unique assets to fund community development activities from the Dormant Accounts Fund, it is unlikely that it would be able to replace them subsequently or satisfy the person affected with adequate compensation.  In addition to the cost of opening the boxes, there is an extensive transfer cost involved in taking control of the contents of safe-keeping deposit boxes, as opposed to a straightforward bank transfer of dormant accounts.  With regard to the transfer of liabilities to the State, as mentioned previously, the private banks are liable for the safe keeping of deposit boxes, which at this point  is most likely to be a loss-making activity.  Any proposal that the State take ownership of them would involve the transfer to the State of the cost of keeping the assets.<br\/><br\/>There is also a significant number of complex legal and constitutional considerations on which others are best placed to advise such as the exact definition of storage that would apply; the risk of challenge as this effectively would amount to the confiscation of private property; adjudication on inheritance disputes and so on.  If the committee seeks to further progress the matter, it may be worth its while considering alternative statutes that would allow the State to access safety deposits in order to identify and take control of assets that could be considered to be key historical artefacts.  It is likely such an approach would provide a stronger public interest rationale and legal basis.<br\/><br\/>As I said, the relatively limited information available on safety deposit boxes makes it very difficult to conduct the necessary cost benefit analysis.  A high level consideration of the issues mentioned indicates that it is difficult to see how a proposal to make safety deposit boxes subject to the Dormant Accounts Act or a statutory cataloguing requirement would pass a full<i>ex-ante<\/i>cost benefit analysis, given the existence of definite costs and risks compared to the very uncertain benefits.<br\/><br\/>I hope this analysis is of assistance to the committee.  We will attempt to answer questions it may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Dorgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dorgan.  I thank all of the delegates for coming.  It is a very interesting topic and an issue that was raised initially by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We have included it in the committee's work programme.  We have had a private meeting to discuss it and are trying to pull everything together.  We are also getting all of the stakeholders around the table.  We have received apologies from the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland.  Unfortunately, its representatives were unable to make it today.  This is an initial step in public session in dealing with the matter.  <\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Connolly for giving us an insight into the workings of the bank and what actually goes on.  We are dealing with the unknown - all of the hidden artefacts, items of interest, paintings, possibly gold bullion, money and so on.  All of this stuff is stored away in the banks.  The issue would involve trying to identify who owned the items and should be the beneficiary.  As Mr. Dorgan said in his statement, they have been there for so long and it is the banks' job to keep them safe.  There is no obligation on them to actually do anything with them.  That is where we come in because there is a window of opportunity under the dormant accounts legislation which falls within the remit of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  That is why the committee is taking on the issue.  I thank Mr. Dorgan for his insight and pointing the committee in a direction that might lead away from that legislation, but it is an area we need to explore.  We have a legal adviser with us today who has also presented to the committee previously.  She is taking note of what is being said.  As it is our intention to possibly publish legislation, from the start we want to get it right.  That is why we invited the delegates.<\/p> <p>  I want to tease out some of the detail.  The 15-year rule for dormant accounts means that if there are no transactions, an account is looked at and absorbed into the fund.  Mr. Connolly has suggested a 100-year rule.  What would be regarded as a reasonable timeframe within which the State could possibly benefit from the proceeds, be they money or historical artefacts which could be sold and the value realised?  The State and community development activities in various areas could benefit.  What would Mr. Dorgan regard as a reasonable timeframe?  In California the rule is that when safety deposit boxes are abandoned, the banks move within a three-year period.  Perhaps that is a bit too quick, but what is Mr. Dorgan's view?  <\/p> <p>  Cost is another big consideration.  Mr. Dorgan has outlined the pitfalls in that regard in terms of who would pay.  We need to get the banking representative group to the table to seek its views.  There are significant cost and legal questions about ownership and title.  The GDPR is a new consideration in the mix.  <\/p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Dorgan might address these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#D00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551868200,"counter":948,"content":"<p>Certainly.  It is difficult to give a definitive view because currently there is no specific Government policy on the issue.  Mr. Connolly's suggestion of a 100-year rule is quite sensible, given that a safety deposit box item could be put away for a considerable length of time.  It is not like a dormant account.  It might assist the committee to know that yesterday I spoke to an official who had worked on the Dormant Account Act in 2003.  She informed me that at the time they had looked at the issue of safety deposit boxes and that it became such a legal and constitutional quagmire that they decided to omit it and progress the core legislation.<\/p> <p>  There is an important aspect to the cost issue - whether the cost would fall on the State or the banking sector.  Even if it was to fall on the banking sector, the reality is that ordinary consumers would pay, be it through the basis points charged on their mortgage or in another way.  They would pay for the cataloguing of assets and wealth.  It is they who would pay the cost, as opposed to the private citizen who had come in to wealth and used the safety deposit box.  From a public interest perspective, the real challenge is presented by Article 43 of the Constitution which provides for the protection of private property, which is allowed to be delimited for reasons to do with the common good.  That is why we believe the common good logic would most likely apply to artefacts of historical and national importance.  It would be very difficult to make the common good argument to do it in the interests of individual citizens who already have vast wealth and need to use safety deposit boxes.  We highlight the cost to the Exchequer, but if there was to be a cost on the banking system, it would fall on ordinary consumers, as opposed to those who had wealth and assets.

We could probably draw on some of the United Kingdom's experience on this front.  It has built an entire private sector industry around heir hunters.  When estates have nominated beneficiaries but nobody can find them, there are private sector firms that locate them.  The companies involved cover the cost of the search and then charge individual beneficiaries for locating them.  Therefore, there are ways to avoid either the State or the banks paying, if there is an appetite to curtail costs, but this issue is bigger than cost.  It goes to the root of fairness.  There are no statistics available, but I would put the figure at tens of thousands of Irish citizens who could benefit from a windfall of property that they simply do not know is there.<\/p><p>They might not be wealthy individuals.  They might be individuals who are in desperate need of money.

The figure varies, but, on average, approximately &euro;50 million comes into the fund each year, while another &euro;25 million is reclaimed.  Even with a period of dormancy of 15 years for bank accounts, there is a huge turnaround of people who are discovering they have a bank account.  The answer I give on the issue is that it should definitely be longer than 15 years if somebody has lost touch with his or her bank account.  For assets, it would have to be longer.<\/p> <p>  The other question is what is the primary objective of the proposed legislation.  If it is about the cultural and heritage elements, the Dormant Accounts Act is not the place to achieve it.  In addition, the idea of a windfall does not necessarily hold true in the case of the Dormant Accounts Act because the State must keep the asset to pay the person or his or her estate in perpetuity.  It is not a windfall but more like almost a loan reserve, if that makes sense.  I am not sure if I am explaining it well.  The cash sits there.  The NTMA keeps a reserve to ensure it can pay people who come for their money.  In reality, it is an alternative source of loaned money, rather than a windfall.<\/p> <p>  They are the two points that come to mind.  What is the key objective or the common good?  Having heard the two other inputs, I do not believe the key benefit is a boost to the Dormant Accounts Fund.  Again, there would have to be a rough idea of the value of assets.  There is significant money in the fund, while there are significant inflows from bank accounts.  The relative scale of what the inflows might be gives one an impression of what the cost-benefit would be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Jordan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551868200,"counter":953,"content":"<p>The dormant deposit instrument was the catalyst for placing an obligation on banks to address the property they held.  Mr. Jordan is right.  If an obligation was placed on the banks to catalogue exactly what they hold, it would give the State the opportunity to examine the property and assess ownership under the National Monuments Act, for example.  It does not have to use the Dormant Accounts Act to claim ownership of some of the property, but there must be a catalyst to force the institutions to catalogue the property in the first place.

He has done a great public good in initiating this conversation.  Having listened to this and previous discussions at this committee, this is property that cannot simply be left there.  We have the choice of leaving it alone, but that would not be appropriate, particularly when we consider that a certain amount of it has been there for 100, 150 or 200 years and that the people who own it are probably long dead.  The issue is one for the families.  Recently I spoke to somebody involved in the legal sector.  Usually when somebody passes away ,the solicitor writes to the banks to ask what moneys are in the person's bank accounts.  He or she does not ask if the person had ever brought a parcel to the bank.  Normally that issue is overlooked and it certainly was overlooked 50 or 100 years ago.  Record keeping is much better today.<\/p> <p>  It is very likely that there is a large number of valuable items.  Some safety deposit boxes could contain valuable jewellery, but they could also contain items that were of value to the individual only.  It could be a set of love letters from somebody in India that the person had received, bundled up and put into the box.  Perhaps they might have been of value to the person only, but they might be of historical interest and value.  Mr. Connolly made that point very clearly.  The issue concerns private property and the law in that regard.  That is where the tangle is.  The bank has taken on a responsibility to protect the interests of the individual and hold his or her private property in safe keeping and, as a result, for his or her estate.<\/p> <p>  Some mechanism must be put in place to move property into a space where it can be dealt with appropriately.  While it is sitting in a vault and probably not costing the bank much from that point of view, at the same time it would be in its interests to have it moved off the pitch to somewhere where it could be sorted out properly.  The State has an obligation to try to do this and come up with a solution that would work for everyone.  The cost involved would probably be considerable.  I accept the point that if some goods were damaged in transit, somebody would be able to sue the State, but whatever legislation is put in place would have to be able to deal with that issue.  It would have to consider all of these issues and provide that if the State was to take on that role, it could not be sued, as it would be doing it in the public interest and the interests of the estate of the person who had first lodged the items.  The issue is how can we legislate in a way that would yield the end result we want, that the items would be taken into safe keeping, opened and examined, a decision would be made on what was to be done with them and a clear effort made to establish the next of kin of the persons who had deposited the items.  At that stage, there would be negotiations with them on what should happen to the particular items.  For example, they might purely be of personal value such as letters or documents that would be of no value to the State, but if they were of great value, perhaps a historical artefact, a way could be found to put them in the National Museum of Ireland for safe keeping.  There is an opportunity to resolve this issue, but we must find a way of doing so that would not expose the State to a huge loss.  The people who lodged these items would not have lodged them in the first place if they were not valuable.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that of heir hunters.  Mr. Connolly referred to the experience in Britain.  Are there examples in other jurisdictions?  In every country there are safety deposit boxes in which items are lodged.  What happens in other jurisdictions?  What models are used in other countries in Europe or elsewhere at which we could look as examples of good practice?  Some of the envelopes lodged could contain large sums of money, but it is probably long out of date.  What will happens to it?  How does the system work if they are old guineas dating from 150 years ago?  What value would they now have, or is there a way of translating the value for the next of kin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#E00500","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":955,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Dorgan might address some of the points raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#E00600","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1551868200,"counter":956,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin Kenny said the banks would be eager to transfer the items and I believe he is correct.

One of our concerns is that we do not allow the banks an easy avenue to offload to the State the problems that come with them in establishing who is the heir or successor.  The models used in other member states would be useful.  The examples Mr. Connolly cited are correct.  In America, in particular, there is a big industry surrounding it.  The big challenge we have always faced - it arose in the case of the Dormant Accounts Act in the period 2001 to 2003 - is Article 43 is viewed as being very restrictive when it comes to private property.  In using a safety deposit box a person consciously makes a decision that it is his or her private property and that he or she is putting it in it for safe keeping.<\/p><p>Cash is a fiduciary issue; that is the benefit of it.<\/p><p> In terms of old money, it is a very interesting question and I honestly do not have an answer.  We can contact the Central Bank to see what cash it will exchange.  It will exchange Irish punts but I do not know how far back it will redeem cash.  We might even have to go further back to see if the Bank of England took over liabilities that were attached to the old, pre-independence Bank of Ireland.

Although they might be very eager to get rid of this property, it would be very conditional.  I have a genuine concern that the banks would view this property as explosive; I am not sure what adjective to use but that is probably the closest term.  To cite an example, imagine we passed legislation and the bank opened the first envelope and it was a will, which the bank would give back to the individual concerned.  The will might state that everything be left to that person's dad, who might have given it to him or her in turn.  However, because the will had not been produced, that would be no good now; the estate may have gone in ten different directions.  The banks might take a view that there is nothing in it for them.  It is possible that a decision would be made to destroy the items for fear of what might be unearthed.  The idea of an amnesty should be considered.  We should recognise that banks will only engage with this if we give them a clear comfort that they are not going to suffer legally as a result and that people cannot go after them for their non-activity.  Whatever we do, the banks have to be insulated in some way.<\/p> <p>  On the currency issue, there is a point at which the Central Bank will exchange currency but if it is guineas, for example, the historical value might be greater than the monetary value.

It is hard to be in two places at once.  In respect of the current dormant accounts, the obligation first is to find the owner.  It is only in the event of the bank not being able to find the owner that there is any question of it being transferred.  The second principle that has always existed is that the money always belongs to the owner if he or she turns up.  This is taken to the point of nonsense, in that the State sees all of the dormant account money that has ever been handed over to it as a current liability.  There are two chances of all of that being reclaimed: none and none.  The amazing thing is that the net inflow every year is approximately &euro;20 million.  That is reclaimed versus money coming in.  There is, therefore, no chance of all the people ever turning up to claim their money.  We are not here to discuss dormant accounts but those two principles are of relevance.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that deposit boxes go back to the beginning of the 19th century.  If it is money and we know who owns it, we know what to do with it; we give it back to the owner.  That is in black and white.  If it is goods and we know to whom they belong, the same principle applies.  We may take it as a certainty that if we opened every box between 1800 to 1900, there would not be anybody alive who put anything in a box.  We would be talking about heirs and descendants, probably at a fair degree of removal at this stage.  Allowing that we can match it up for them to get their property back, they might not want to leave it in a deposit box but they might not realise it is there.  We would decide using the same principles we have used elsewhere.  If an artefact is found that is over a certain age, the State has a claim on it anyway.  If I find a golden chalice on my land, unfortunately I do not get to own it.  Even though I bought the land and everything in the land, despite what I thought, I do not own everything, depending on what is found under the land or in the property.  That principle is well established.<\/p> <p>  If we started at 1800 and stopped at 1900, on the issue of privacy, we have published the 1911 census.  There was a question when people wanted us to move forward faster in terms of people being alive who are mentioned in censuses and so on.  We have decided that, even though census documents are confidential, they can be made public, and they have been made public up to 1911.  We have all found our own relatives in them and discovered all sorts of interesting facts we did not know.  In our family, we found that Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, my grandfather, filled out the census form in Irish but spelled our name phonetically in a simplified Irish: C-U-I-B.  He carried that to the nth degree.  <\/p> <p>  Let us presume we go in and open every box, starting at 1800 and working up through the years.  If we find money and find the owner, we give it back.  If we find articles and find the owner, we give them back.  Supposing we find very interesting artefacts akin to what we might find in museums or whatever, which do not compromise anybody or any family.  They could be lent to the State and put on display but that they would still belong to the owner if he or she ever turned up.  In that case, we are not transferring ownership but putting them display.  We would take a little liberty with the property but not transfer the ownership.  In Kilmainham or any of those places there are artefacts on permanent loan.  They do not have to be owned.  Assuming more current boxes were not opened - I suspect it would be a long time before we would get to 1900 - by keeping it back in the very distant past and only putting items of national interest on display without transferring ownership - would that pose a huge problem?<\/p> <p>  If this area were covered by legislation, there would be a lot of good for the State.  There could be interesting documents or artefacts that could give a much wider understanding of our history.<\/p><p>It would show us some probably beautiful items that have been hidden away.  There is probably a Caravaggio, a Rubens or something else there.  It would be an awful pity not to have it on display.  Owners can come to collect if they can prove their ownership.<\/p><p> If that is the way it is done and deposit boxes of a much more recent vintage are not opened and publicly displayed, and a committee is set up to adjudicate whether certain standards and criteria were followed, would Mr. Connolly foresee problems, if it was legislated for?  I have heard about Article 43 all my life in politics.  I have never understood the interpretation that was imputed to the article by the courts regarding private ownership.  It always seemed that the right to private ownership was being taken as absolute whereas the Constitution is clear that it is subject to the exigencies of the common good.  I always remember when we had to make decisions in this House curtailing rights to property, etc., relating to wages, pensions and such during the recent financial crisis.  The legislation stated that there was a right to private ownership but it was not absolute and it could be curtailed if it was outweighed by the common good.  By not transferring ownership, only using a loan and doing that judiciously, I often wonder what challenge could arise.  In one of the documents, Mr. Connolly mentioned a jewelled sword.  Supposing a jewelled sword turns up and one puts it on display as something valuable and interest from the Crimean War, a dress sword, the Battle of Waterloo or an award for gallantry or such, if the family turns up and says it is theirs, what complaint could they have since they would never have found out it was there in the first place?<\/p><p> We have become paranoid in the State about challenges.  I take the view that we took as a House in 2010 that one weighs up the circumstances and says that if somebody wants to challenge it, it is fine, but very unlikely.  It was proven to be unlikely in 2010 and did not happen.  If constructed properly, it would prove unlikely in this case as well.  The principles should be not to transfer ownership of any artefacts, because one cannot replace them, but just put them on display; start with the oldest ones first and work forward so that nobody alive will be affected one way or another, and the depositor can never come back to say he or she deposited it on the basis that it would never be opened, because he or she does not exist any more; if the owner is found, he or she gets it immediately; and if the owner cannot be found but subsequently turns up because it was put on display, he or she gets it, which means that it has been an advantage to their property rights because he or she gets property that he or she would not have known existed.<\/p><p> That leaves one question that seems to worry banks.  I thought banks were full of money but they are worried about the cost of all of this.  If this is done judiciously and carefully, it might not be that much of a cost and if there is a cost to either the State or the banks, that is something that one would work out as one goes along.  There is a matter of corporate responsibility.  Agencies spend much money on corporate responsibility, goodwill, advertising, sponsoring sports and such.  Older banks with older deposits could generate a lot of goodwill by doing this if it was done properly.<\/p><p> There is a separate issue that has nothing to do with the debate, which we can put aside.  That is the regulation of safe deposit boxes from here on, because that has become a private industry.  People who go to them are going to non-regulated entities.  It is an interesting question, since it has moved away from the banks, of how safe all these deposit houses are.  I do not know but it is nothing to do with this so we will leave that to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#F00500","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":963,"content":"<p>That begs the question of who is responsible for regulation in that regard.

The Deputy's point is right that the common good is the historic and national importance of these artefacts.  It is more difficult to justify these on a common good basis if an individual gets an asset of wealth because the State has taken an action.

So that argument is a red herring.<br\/><br\/>I totally agree with everything Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said.  I can give a bit of colour on the sword he mentioned, because it is a very interesting story in its own right.  My engagement with Bank of Ireland was actually in a professional manner and does not relate to the time that I worked for the bank.  I created a television programme that never saw the light of day that was based on safekeeping.  I was given a tour around the vault in Bank of Ireland's branch in College Green.  One of the questions I asked is whether any of the items were every opened and I was directed to this chest, with a big belt around the middle of it, which is like a chest that was carried at the back of the <i>Titanic<\/i>.  The chest was deposited for safekeeping at the turn of the 20th century.  To the best of my knowledge it was deposited in 1905.  I was visiting the vaults in 2003 but I was told the chest was opened in 1995, when President Clinton addressed the nation from College Green.  The American Secret Service, as well as welding shut all the manholes and getting rid of all the bins around College Green, went into the vaults which would have been directly below the stage from where President Clinton was addressing the nation and a sniffer dog took issue with the chest that had been there for the guts of 90 years.  Out of courtesy to the American Secret Service, the chest was opened and inside was war memorabilia, including a ceremonial sword with a jewel encrusted butt, as well as a loaded pistol.  It was the gunpowder in the loaded pistol that the dog had picked up on.  That gives members a flavour of the richness of the history that this stuff represents.  The idea is to go back to the oldest item on deposit and deal with each item <i>seriatim<\/i>.  This is a task of elephantine size that can be eaten one bite at a time.  The easiest way to proceed is to go to the earliest item and move forward from there. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019030600002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1551868200,"counter":983,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Connolly.

I suppose there is an easy answer and I presume the Department will agree with this, the Oireachtas does.  The next question is who sponsors the Bill.  If it is a Government Bill, it will be a Government decision to decide, whether it will come under the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or the Department for Rural and Community Development.  If this had happened during the period when there was a single Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs or earlier, when arts and culture and dormant accounts were under a single remit, one would not have this problem.  The Government has to decide which Department will sponsor the legislation and that it consults with the other Departments.  That is a technical issue.<\/p> <p>  I think it would be much better if it were to come under the dormant accounts legislation but that is a personal view and if somebody decides otherwise, I am happy.   Basically, one would be returning property to the people who owned it and it would only be when one could not find the heirs and the artefacts were of national interest that one would then decide, on a case-by-case basis, to put them on display rather than leave them to moulder.<\/p> <p>  Let us suppose that we added another 500 years, such that some of the items were 600 years or 700 years of age.  Would anybody think it would be correct to leave interesting and valuable artifacts that long?  No, of course not.  <\/p> <p>  I think the issue of privacy is a total non-issue because we published the census.  That was much more immediate.  The 1911 census has been open for ten to 15 years.  We did not go forward with opening up the next census, because of issues.  <\/p> <p>  When we get to items dating from 1860 to 1880, if there were issues arising that had not been foreseen, one would deal with them then.  Would Mr. Connolly agree that if one were to put the items on display, one would have to have a committee who would decide what was appropriate, along with criteria of sensitivity, national interest and so on, so that it would not be a case of throwing everything on the table but that a committee would oversee it?

The commitment by the Government to invest &euro;1.2 billion in our culture, language and heritage over the next ten years underpins the recognition of their importance to sustainable development over the next decade and beyond.  This level of investment is both unprecedented and transformative, and given the benefits that it will bring to communities across the country, I am deeply committed to ensuring that this ambitious programme of investment is delivered fully and well.<\/p> <p>  My plan for the Department will bring together for the first time all aspects of our heritage &ndash; cultural, linguistic, built and natural &ndash; under a single programme of investment with a holistic vision.  It is a ten-year investment programme and projects will move through a number of stages in the delivery cycle during this time.  At this relatively early stage in the process, much of our energies for 2019 will be focused on ensuring comprehensive appraisal of proposals to ensure that investment decisions are based on best available evidence and are robustly evaluated.  As we move further into the delivery phase of programmes and projects, my Department will work closely with the investment projects and programmes office in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of technical and other supports.  Together we will work to ensure that all of our projects and programmes are subject to robust project governance and rigorous cost control, and are delivered to the highest standard possible.<\/p> <p>  This year, we will see some positive developments in the delivery of a number of capital projects under our sectoral capital plan as part of Project Ireland 2040.  We will see the completion of phase 1 of the National Library and subsequent phases moving into detailed design and planning.  We will also see significant progress on the National Archives project, beginning with the decanting of materials to facilitate development works next month, and the launch in September of Galway 2020, our European Capital of Culture, with cultural programming starting in late 2019.<\/p> <p>  On our commitments to supporting enterprise development, 2019 will see us increase our investment in the audiovisual sector through Screen Ireland and across Gaeltacht communities through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  We will deliver on commitments to protect our built heritage through the built heritage investment scheme, which leverages private funding, local authority structures and central Government grants to protect our built heritage while utilising local craft and construction resources.<\/p> <p>  On our natural heritage, we are actively working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on the implementation of our tourism interpretation master plan which will enhance visitor experiences across our national parks and nature reserves network.<\/p> <p>  The Deputies are well aware that the remit and responsibilities of my Department are very broad and diverse.  I propose, therefore, to address the issues arising across my Department&rsquo;s Vote on a programme by programme basis, but in the first instance, I would like to provide a broad outline of the overall position.  A gross provision of just under &euro;339 million is available to my Department in 2019.  An additional &euro;700,000 in funding has been carried over from the 2018 capital provision for expenditure on priority projects in accordance with the provisions of public financial procedures.  In broad terms, the 2019 breakdown of allocations to my Vote is as follows: &euro;189 million for culture, including &euro;75 million for the Arts Council; &euro;47.4 million for the national cultural institutions; &euro;20 million for Screen Ireland; &euro;12.2 million for cultural infrastructure and development and a dedicated funding stream of over &euro;7 million for Creative Ireland, which is the Government&rsquo;s legacy project for Ireland 2016; more than &euro;54 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s built and natural heritage, including &euro;13.7 million for natural heritage; just under &euro;6.6 million for the Heritage Council; just over &euro;6.3 million for built heritage, including the very successful built heritage investment scheme; &euro;55.5 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands; and just under &euro;40.4 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies - Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.<\/p> <p>  The gross allocation for my Department in 2019 is 12% higher than the comparable figure for 2018 and allows for increases in funding across a range of bodies under my Department&rsquo;s remit, as well as increases in funding for a number of culture, heritage and Gaeltacht schemes.<\/p><p>This additional funding is targeted at key initiatives.  These include a 10% increase in Arts Council funding to &euro;75 million, including over &euro;6 million in current funding, which is more than double the increase in 2018.  It has also increased F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann funding by &euro;2 million or 11% for implementation of the <i>Audiovisual Action Plan;<\/i>and allocated &euro;6 million in funding for the European Capital of Culture, that is, Galway 2020.  There are boosts in funding for all of the national cultural institutions; dedicated funding of over &euro;7 million for the further development and implementation of the Creative Ireland programme; the heritage programme has additional capital of just under &euro;5 million in 2019, an increase of some 47% on 2018, which will provide for over 520 restoration projects; and further investment in visitor services and trails at our national parks and implementation of the national biodiversity action plan.<br\/><br\/>An additional &euro;1 million has also been provided to allow for increased investment in our waterways; an additional &euro;2 million in funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in addition to the &euro;700,000 available to it via capital carryover from 2018; and an increase of 20% or &euro;1.5 million for our islands and an increase of &euro;600,000 for the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language.  Almost &euro;1.7 million in additional funding towards schemes to promote the Irish language both inside and outside the Gaeltacht has been allocated.  This increased funding is tangible evidence of the importance attached to our cultural and creative heritage under Project Ireland 2040 and clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to increase spending in the arts and culture sector on a trajectory that will see funding doubled by 2025.<br\/><br\/>My colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, and I will now both make brief remarks on individual programme areas and are happy to expand later on any matter members may wish to raise.  I will commence with some details on the culture programme.  Some &euro;189 million is provided in 2019 for culture.  This includes boosts in funding for all of the national cultural institutions, making their combined total allocations for 2019 in excess of &euro;47 million.  Collectively, these institutions attracted more than 3 million visitors in 2018 and represent a key component of our cultural tourism product offering.<br\/><br\/>The Arts Council, our national agency for funding, developing and promoting the arts in Ireland will receive an additional &euro;7 million in 2019 to enhance its support to artists and arts organisations of all sizes throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>Screen Ireland will receive an additional &euro;2 million to build on its vital work in supporting Irish film, television drama, documentary and animation.  This additional funding together with the extension of section 481 relief until 2024 will help develop and support the necessary environment for Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation as outlined in my Department's audiovisual action plan published last June.  This industry-wide, long-term plan, under the Creative Ireland programme, will support the Government&rsquo;s ambition to enable Ireland to become a global hub for this sector and the first progress report under the plan is due to be published in the second half of this year.<br\/><br\/>The Creative Ireland programme is the Government&rsquo;s legacy project for Ireland 2016, which aims to harness the goodwill, engagement and momentum created by the Ireland 2016 programme and places creativity at the centre of public policy.  Last year was the programme's second year and saw the successful delivery of a number of cross-departmental and inter-agency co-operative initiatives including creative schools together with the Department of Education and Skills and led by the Arts Council involving some 38,000 children; culture and creativity strategies for all 31 local authorities together with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; and the National Creativity Fund facilitating 30 new cross-sectoral initiatives including Le Ch&eacute;ile, the first music ensemble for young disabled musicians in Europe led by the Royal Irish Academy of Music and culminating in the founding of the Open Youth Orchestra of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The increase in funding for Creative Ireland in 2019 will build on this momentum by further developing the programme as well as providing funding increases to key institutions, agencies and initiatives that deliver arts, creativity and culture right across the country.<br\/><br\/>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g which is presented in partnership with the local authorities and RT&Eacute; took place for the first time in 2018 and was a major success with 500 events across the country.  This national day of creativity has been received positively as a way of getting children involved in new creative activities and supporting local artists and voluntary arts groups.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is the first country in the world to have a day dedicated to children&rsquo;s creativity and plans for 2019 include a global programme for Cruinni&uacute; in our embassies and consul offices as part of Global Ireland 2025 in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I think that will take place on 23 June.<br\/><br\/>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is part of the Creative Youth pillar of the Creative Ireland programme and will enjoy increased funding of &euro;6 million for 2019 funded by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills to further enable the creativity of all children and young people.<br\/><br\/>Culture Ireland will deliver a global programme of Irish arts in 2019 with an increased budget of &euro;4.6 million.  It is planned to reach new markets, which Ireland is targeting for trade and tourism, including China.  To achieve a wider reach for Irish arts Culture Ireland will continue to showcase Irish artists at a planned series of showcases and build on the 470 events supported in 55 countries in 2018.<br\/><br\/>As part of my Department's ongoing contribution to the Global Ireland 2025 initiative, a conference of cultural stakeholders to identify how best to advance our global visibility and strengthen our global relationships was held on 24 January 2019 involving international guests, festivals and programmers as well as business, tourism and cultural interests in Ireland.  This day-long conference brought together more than 250 key stakeholders in the arts and culture community to debate how we can strategically strengthen and advance our renowned global reputation for creativity.<br\/><br\/>Finally in terms of the culture programme, &euro;6 million has been allocated in 2019 to Galway 2020, European Capital of Culture, to allow for preparatory work on this year of unforgettable cultural experience which will allow Galway and Ireland to become a window to Europe and indeed the rest of the world.<br\/><br\/>If the Chairman wishes, I can take questions on the culture Vote here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12019030600002#B00400","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>We will continue and take all the questions together at the end.

A couple of questions for both Ministers have been drawn to my attention.  Some &euro;339 million is available to the Department and I have no argument with the way this money is being spent.  The spending areas, including the Arts Council and national cultural institutions, are vital for the whole country.  There is no point in going through what the Minister has already discussed in great detail.  This level of funding, and probably much more, is required.  The Minister is doing the best she can with the funds available to her.<\/p> <p>  I noticed that the rural regeneration programme provided &euro;3.5 million to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I am not sure for what project this money was provided.  I have the details in my office; I should have brought them with me.  The Department has &euro;339 million to spend, and it could probably spend much more if it had it, but 43 community projects in Cork county alone which sought funding under the rural regeneration programme did not receive anything.  How did a Department with a fund of &euro;339 million get &euro;3.5 million from the rural regeneration programme?  Perhaps the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, should answer that question.  If that is the case, that is fair enough and it is a question I need to put to him.  I know of one shovel-ready project that would create 20 or 30 jobs in a rural community.  It is ready to roll but did not get funding, yet it sees Departments getting funding.  I do not know how much Coillte got but it was many millions.  This has caused great frustration.  A budget of &euro;339 million is a substantial amount of money.  Is that budget being topped up with money from the rural regeneration programme?  Is that included in the &euro;339 million or is it additional?  I would appreciate an answer if the Minister can provide one.  If she cannot, perhaps she can come back to me.  I do not want to put people on the spot but this is an important point to raise.  I am trying to deal with the whole of Cork county, in which 43 projects were rejected out of hand.  They were all community projects, which is very important.<\/p> <p>  I will ask another question while I have the floor, although I do not want to hog the airwaves.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, carried forward an underspend of &euro;700,000 from last year.  I wish I had known that money was available because the residents of eight islands in west Cork would have loved a contribution from that funding.  They are probably getting something from it, but there are many genuine projects which could have used some funding.  The issue of chaperones for children coming from the islands has probably been raised with the Minister of State several times.  Their parents are losing work hours in the morning bringing children to and from the islands, especially Sherkin Island.  An olive branch was offered to these parents to the effect that, if the school closed, a chaperone would be provided to bring the children to the school so that parents could go to work in the morning.<\/p><p>A lot of people are reconsidering living on an island.  They might need to be at work at 8 o'clock in the morning and that cannot happen because they have to bring the children to school off the island at 9 a.m.  They have to be there again at 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. to bring them back.  We are losing people from the island.  There is &euro;0.7 million of an underspend.  Can it be directed back towards people like that to give them a better quality of island life?  I would appreciate if the Minister could give me an insight into that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12019030600002#D00500","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct that there is &euro;339 million provided to the Department.  My understanding is that from the rural fund we got &euro;7.381 million for heritage and &euro;3.86 million for the Gaeltacht.  Many of our projects are in rural areas.  In respect of Cork, there was funding of &euro;5.4 million in arts grants in 2018, including to the Cork Butter Museum, Cork county council, Briery Gap, and the Sirius Arts Centre.  West Cork Arts Centre got &euro;1,272.  Funding went to St. Peter's Cork Leisure World, Cork Opera House, the National Sculpture Factory, Graffiti Theatre, Firkin Crane, the Everyman Theatre, the Cork Arts Theatre, and the Glen Theatre.  There is a long list of projects that were funded in Cork.  There were also built heritage grant payments to the old schoolhouse in Newmarket, and to projects in Macroom, Carrigaphooca, which is where my grandfather was born, Rossacon Newmarket, Myrtle Grove, Emmet Place and a few more.

Within my own Department, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta benefited from a number of projects within that such as the gTeic technology hubs in An Spid&eacute;al and other areas.  It is a wonderful initiative that groups like &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta can apply to that fund and secure funding.  It has added to the overall funding from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for the year.<\/p> <p>  On the underspend, there was a capital underspend of &euro;0.7 million which was transferred to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  That was under C3, the Gaeltacht support schemes, under which a number of projects that were expected to draw down money were not available.  That is capital funding; even if we were to decide to fund the chaperones, that would be from current funding.  The Department provided extra sailings at additional cost to the Department to accommodate the school closure in Sherkin.  As the Deputy will remember, I was there that day at the celebration, not of the school's closure, but of its being, I suppose.  We funded extra sailings so we would have expected that another agency or Department would have been able to fund the chaperone.  Certainly, if it was agreed upon when the decision was made to close the school, then I would expect the Department of Education and Skills should be in a position to examine the matter again.  A conscious decision was made to close the school and that could not have been an easy decision for some parents to accept at the time.  If there were promises or commitments given, they should be honoured by other Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12019030600002#E00500","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>On the last point raised by Deputy Collins, I would like to record the appreciation of the people of the greater Athy area in south Kildare for the &euro;2.7 million that was recently awarded under the rural regeneration fund, predominantly for the upgrade of Athy heritage centre.

The &euro;2.7 million is going to lead to the development of the Ernest Shackleton centre, safeguarding and promoting a key part of our heritage.

We also have three new pilot local creative youth partnerships, which are being led by Kerry, Laois, Offaly and Limerick.  They were announced after a competitive process.  These partnerships aim to enhance creative and cultural activities in disadvantaged areas.  The creative schools programme has been particularly successful and in the future I would like to see it further rolled out to more than just 300 schools.  We try to encompass DEIS schools, primary and secondary schools, so there is a mixture of different schools being able to benefit from it.

Investment in those areas is often returned in spades and enhances our international reputation, a subject to which I will return.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of questions that we will return to later.  Members asked questions about the film industry, including the specific numbers of jobs being created by the significant investment in the industry over the years and the enhanced investment this year.  <\/p> <p>  We will leave the question about the theatre because I do not wish to discuss the Abbey Theatre today.

Per Cent for Art is a public sculpture scheme that is available for installations along motorways and at other major capital projects.  I am interested that the Government has the ability to commission major capital projects.  One such project, the national children's hospital, is in the news for the wrong reasons but there are other schemes.  Is it intended to ensure that art forms part of those works, whether in public view, in the corridors of a building or elsewhere?  Will the Minister elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  The committee previously heard presentations from the Local Authority Museum Network, which represents smaller, local museums, in which it explained the additional burdens on local museums and, in some cases, the need to access funding for works around the museum and for security.  The network stated when people visit local museums, in many ways the museums do not have the security or wherewithal to protect their works in the way they should, and that it would be easier for them to digitalise some of their collections, put them on display in facsimile and send them back to the families who granted them access or send them to the national programme.  In my dealings with the national institutions, I have noted their strong desire to make as much of their collections as possible available to the public online, given the new technology available.<\/p> <p>  I had hoped to attend a highly successful project in the past two weeks, namely, the digitalisation of pension and other records, which is being run by the Department of Defence.  The project is accessible and the website receives a high number of hits from around the world.  An online study programme for the Book of Kells has been made available this week by Trinity College and anybody can take part in it.  It is another example of our national treasures being made available beyond our shores and beyond their physical limits.  I am interested to learn whether the funding that is available can be considered for the future.  Two other museums have been mooted, including moving the Garda museum from Dublin Castle to Kevin Street where the original Peeler station - it was not a Garda station - existed.  Is that being considered now that Kevin Street Garda station has been fully built and the old building can be vacated?<\/p> <p>  Representatives of the Heritage Council appeared before the committee on a number of occasions in the past year, including once or twice since I took over the Chair.  The council sought funding to ensure it would have the full cohort of staff it requires.  Representatives from the Local Authority Heritage Officer Network also appeared before the committee and appealed for funding to be made available through the Minister's good offices or through local authorities in order that each local authority could have a heritage officer in place.<\/p> <p>  I was delighted to hear the Minister mention the additional money to address invasive species, such as Japanese knotweed, rhododendrons and another which I cannot remember.  It appears from legislation that only two species are reportable.  If one sees Japanese knotweed and the other weed, which is yellow, one is supposed to report it and the local authority is supposed to take action.  In the case of the yellow one, which is usually seen on derelict building sites and so on, there does not seem to be any action taken to remove it or stop its spread.  On rhododendrons, the Minister mentioned Killarney National Park, which is being strangled by rhododendrons.  However, it is not the only major heritage area that needs the wherewithal and personnel to deal with this.  Members of a men's shed travelled to Killarney on separate weekends this year to try to help because all that is needed to remove rhododendrons is labour.  The question is how we can encourage that type of meitheal or attitude.  While I accept some funding is available, it is not only a matter of funding.  Rather, we must try to mobilise the local community to get stuck in and remove the plants.  I do not know enough about Japanese knotweed but I think it is strangling our waterways and the same type of action might be required, that is, physical work rather than funding.  While the latter will help, it needs to be spent and the local authorities need to ensure it is spent on as many people as possible. <\/p> <p>  On the recent scandalous attack on St. Michan's Church and the beheading of the crusader, although the head has, thankfully, been returned, this incident strengthens the call for an increase to the historic structures fund in order that security can become a part of it.  It should not just cover the protection of the structure but also the exterior and surveillance to ensure that people will be discouraged from carrying out such actions.<\/p><p>There have been other attacks and wanton vandalism of some of our historical structures.  <\/p><p> The canal is just outside my door.  If I throw a stone from my back garden, it lands in the canal in Dublin.  The problem with the Grand Canal is that it is the responsibility of Waterways Ireland, which is not under the aegis of the Department.  Few barges travel on the Grand Canal, except on certain weekends.  The towpath is fine on one side but in the Bluebell, Inchicore and Clondalkin areas, there is land on both sides of the canal, which should be enhanced.  This is not a criticism of the grant this year.  I simply wish to encourage Waterways Ireland and the local authorities that back onto the canal to plan something that can be worked on quickly.  The land is there and its improvement could be delivered quickly.<\/p><p> I will let the Minister answer those questions, before posing more.  <\/p><p> An &eacute; go gcaithfidh an tAire St&aacute;it imeacht?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12019030600002#F00500","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>No.  T&aacute; v&oacute;ta ar si&uacute;l anois.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12019030600002#G00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm.

He referred to the film industry in general and we have spoken about it in the D&aacute;il by way of parliamentary questions.  At the moment, according to the Olsberg report, there are approximately 12,000 whole-time equivalent jobs in the audiovisual sector and the sector is worth approximately &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.<\/p> <p> I have said that I intend to reform the per cent for art scheme and a proposal in that regard is currently under consideration.  It is clear that the existing &euro;64,000 project limit should be revisited.  At the moment, the scheme provides financial support for art works and thresholds are in place, namely, 1% up to &euro;2.55 million, up to a maximum of &euro;25,500, and then they go up incrementally.  I am looking at revising those limits to double the level of financial support, broadly speaking.  I am also looking at establishing a new, higher contribution for the largest projects.  We are also looking at improving data collection and re-establishing the interdepartmental committee to improve the flow of information in the context of harmonisation and the implementation of the scheme.  I have not finally decided exactly how much will be involved but the point made by the Deputy is important.  The scheme is useful from an aesthetic perspective, as well as helping artists.  I intend to revise the scheme as soon as possible.  <\/p> <p>  Reference was made to museums in general.  We have a digitisation fund under the National Development Plan, NDP, of approximately &euro;10 million.  Some of that funding has been used for projects.  On the mobility of our collections, while funding is available for local and regional galleries and museums, there are costs associated with transport.  I believe the Chairman's father was involved with the National Museum of Ireland so he will be aware of the difficulties that face museums in terms of transporting pieces from the national collections to and from the institution, including the costs of insurance while they are being transported and the costs of exhibiting pieces.  Just to go back a bit, in the context of the digitisation of collections, the Chester Beatty Library is a good example.  There was a poor uptake of the mobility of collections scheme in 2016.  In fact, there was only one applicant so the allocation was reduced for 2017.  In that year, only four projects were supported from seven applications.  The remaining three were not fully eligible.  The funding, based on demand, is there and was held at &euro;25,000 for 2018.  A total of &euro;9,122 was awarded to three projects under the scheme in 2018.  Given the declining demand for this scheme, consideration is being given to a reduced allocation in 2019.  As with anything else, if it is under-utilised, it is difficult to secure funding for it.  I appreciate the comments that the Chairman made on the scheme-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12019030600002#G00800","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>Comments were made to me about difficulties with the way the scheme is structured, the lead-in times and the fact that availing of it takes a long time to plan.

An allocation of &euro;95,000 was approved to support the transition phase of that initiative.  It is being led by Trinity College, Dublin and is a very exciting project.  It will go a long way to preserving our collections and records, which are important in the context of Irish history.  <\/p><p>Reference was made to invasive species, particularly Japanese knotweed.  It is difficult to deal with them but it is something that we must tackle.  It is an offence to spread alien invasive species and responsibility for dealing with such species ultimately falls to the landowner.  The law is enforceable to some extent but it is difficult in the case of individuals who allow species such as knotweed or rhododendron to infest lands around their property, particularly if they are elderly or infirm.  Many introductions are accidental but some are deliberate.  In terms of invasive fish species, accidental introductions can happen when they are carried on the bottom of boats or get caught in fishing tackle and so on.  The Asian clam is an insidious, highly invasive freshwater species and it is often difficult to acquire sufficient proof for prosecutions for that particular species.  New regulations, which transposed the 2014 EU regulations on invasive species, have been introduced here.  The EU published a new regulation, which came into operation on 1 January 2015.  It aims to establish a framework for concerted action across the EU to prevent the spread of invasive species to protect biodiversity and the economic health of certain sectors.  The former Minister at my Department, Deputy Heather Humphreys, announced the establishment of an invasive fund in late 2017 for the targeted removal of invasive alien species, particularly those listed under the EU regulation.  Funding can be provided to local authorities for projects led by the authorities themselves or by community groups.  The fund amounts to &euro;150,000 in the first year of operation, which was 2018, and<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>I increased that to &euro;200,000 this year.  I announced that increase at the National Biodiversity Conference.  I also promised at that conference to double the funding.  The Chairman's points about invasive species are important.

Approximately &euro;300,000 was spent in 2017, with &euro;110,000 spent on clearing rhododendron in Glenveagh National Park.<\/p><p>Doubling the previous funding amount to tackle invasive species is an important commitment.

I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his officials.  As members are aware, the areas of transport, tourism and sport face challenging times, with numerous issues arising from Brexit and capital and current infrastructural projects in all three sectors, as well as many other issues which we have discussed at the joint committee in the past 12 months.  In responding to these challenges the financing and resourcing of the sectors in the year ahead are very important.  The committee will explore the issues, with the emphasis on several key points.  <\/p> <p>  The proposed format is that we deal with Vote 31 on a programme by programme basis.  The Minister will make an opening statement.  There are five programmes which we will consider separately by way of questions from members of the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I remind members that mobile phones should be turned off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they cause interference with the recording and broadcasting equipment in committee rooms, even when left in silent mode.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

It provides for an overall gross allocation for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of over &euro;2.3 billion.  We will use the funding to provide some of the economic and social infrastructure Ireland needs now.  The funding allocated represents a 15% increase on investment levels in 2018 and each of our programmes of investment will share in the increased level of funding.  <\/p> <p>  Much of the Department's work involves supporting services and maintaining infrastructural assets in safe and usable condition.  For that reason, we sought and were granted an increase in our current expenditure budget this year.  The coming year will see the support we provide in this area grow by 7.5%, which represents an increase of &euro;52.9 million on the figure for 2018.  Since Ireland's economy has picked up, it has been necessary for us to get back to investing in critical economic infrastructure such as the road network.  Challenges such as climate change and congestion also mean that we need to provide stronger public transport links.  Project Ireland 2040 provides for a step change in funding to meet our investment needs in this area.  It also recognises the role played by ports and airports in the international connectivity of our island nation.  <\/p> <p>  Our plan also provides scope to boost our tourism offering and support grassroots sporting endeavours at local level, while also providing world class facilities for our national and international sports heroes.  For these reasons, the capital investment proposals before the committee for 2019 would see an increase of over &euro;259 million or 19.5% compared to the figure for 2018.  We foresee the increasing levels of activity continuing into the coming years.<\/p> <p>  In budget 2019 we made a policy choice to convert &euro;30 million of our capital allocation for use as current expenditure.  Maintaining our assets is a costly exercise, but it is necessary and saves money in the long term.  Additionally, Brexit is very likely to adversely affect the tourism industry.  We are choosing to prioritise support for the tourism agencies to best mitigate the negative impact of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.  <\/p> <p>  Budget 2019 also saw an increase in the VAT rate charged in a number of sectors, including the hospitality sector.  We decided that giving agencies the ability to target specific support for tourism in specific locations would be better.  With the fillip these investment plans provide for tourism services, we can direct support towards those who need it most.  <\/p> <p>  More recently, pressures across government have required all Departments to refine slightly their extensive investment plans for 2019.  While my Department was able to assist Government colleagues substantially, we have not had to make cuts to any project.  Our commitment to support the construction of the A5 road to Derry has not changed and we will meet our agreed commitments in that regard.  We understand the Northern Irish authorities are equally committed.  Work on the road will be undertaken in due course by our friends and neighbours in Northern Ireland and we will be able to fund our share as costs arise.  In the meantime, we have been able to make the best use of any construction delay to move that funding this year.<\/p> <p>  My Department and I consider our task of delivering first class infrastructure and services to be both an honour and a duty.  We will safeguard the taxpayers' investment as we do so.  We work closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and follow the public spending code to monitor our programmes.  Within my Department we have a team of economists and analysts who are dedicated to prior evaluation of projects and programmes.  As a Department, we have well established oversight procedures in place to monitor expenditure and are fortunate to work with agencies with a recent track record of delivery and achieving value for money.  We are aware, however, that we cannot be complacent and that increased levels of expenditure planned under Project Ireland 2040, as well as recent events, require us to examine with a fresh perspective how we go about our work in this area.  The committee can be assured that good governance and oversight are at the centre of our work and will remain so in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly go through the five programmes of investment in my Department, the funding levels and plans we have for 2019.  I will start with the civil aviation programme.  Direct investment in aviation during 2019 will be roughly &euro;37 million, which represents just over 1% of expenditure in my Department.  Much of the work we do under this programme involves working with regulators and international partners.  The international commercial nature of air travel means that my Department's investment focuses mainly on regional access.  The largest beneficiary of the funding is the regional airports programme, at &euro;21.7 million, followed by the funding earmarked to cover the costs associated with our membership of Eurocontrol, the costs incurred by the Irish Aviation Authority for certain services and subscriptions to international organisations.  Therefore, the key priority for investment in the aviation programme in the short to medium term is providing support for regional airports.  We confine our investment and support to safety and security related projects and our involvement is informed by the regional airports programme for the period 2015 to 2019.<\/p> <p>  Programme B - land transport programme - is the largest programme by far in my Department's Vote, accounting for approximately 80% of our overall budget.  This year the programme budget will increase by over &euro;260 million, or 16%, to &euro;1.9 billion.  Most of the increase derives from stepped up in investment in roads and mass transit services.  The main components of the programme are road improvements and maintenance funding, with an overall budget of just over &euro;1 billion; the public transport investment programme, at &euro;481 million, and PSO payments for public service provision, at &euro;302 million.<\/p><p>The programme also includes provision of &euro;7 million towards the carbon reduction programme and a further &euro;1.9 million, in carried-over funding, will be applied to this programme too.  In addition, the operating costs for the national vehicle and driver licensing system are just under &euro;22 million.  This system helps us to collect motor taxes and fees such as toll fees on the M50.<\/p><p> As for public transport, in 2019, we will again allocate investment to protect the quality and value of our existing public transport networks.  Significantly, the funding being made available in 2019 to Irish Rail, in its role as infrastructure manager, is at the steady-state level, as measured on an annual basis.  That is hugely important and represents real progress.  The steady-state level of funding carries through to our public service obligation, PSO, bus fleets also, with the funding provided allowing for the optimal amount of bus replacement, which means older and more polluting buses are replaced by newer and cleaner ones.  It is not just steady state; we are also expanding and upgrading infrastructure.  That means we are continuing to plan for the future with BusConnects, MetroLink, the DART expansion and the various cycling network plans in the major cities.  We will also deliver new infrastructure like the extended trams, which will shortly arrive for the Luas green line, or the various cycling projects due to start construction this year, or the proposed new national train control centre, which should start construction by the end of the year.  The funding provided in 2019 will make a real and lasting difference to the lives of citizens across the country.  We are also committed to the ongoing retrofitting of older existing public transport facilities to improve their accessibility features and, as members will know, accessibility is built into new projects.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, we apply a lot of funding to public service obligation services.  In 2019, we will continue to support the continued delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services throughout the country.  We intend for them to continue their growth over recent years and we will facilitate some further expansion, including progressing the bus market opening.  As is normal, the precise allocations to the companies, including Irish Rail, will be decided by the National Transport Authority, NTA, in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with the various PSO service providers.  Additionally, rural transport services that respond to local needs have also increased and we will continue to support these through enhanced funding.  We will target new and innovative ideas to help decarbonise the transport sector, including pilot initiatives for low emission technologies and incentives to encourage the national taxi fleet towards greener fuels and private car drivers towards electric vehicles.<\/p><p> On roads, approximately &euro;1.06 billion is available for the roads improvement and maintenance programme and with this, we will continue to provide grant support for the national, regional and local road networks.  This investment will be used to maintain and renew the national, regional and local road surfaces.  As members are aware, the total network is about 99,000 km in extent.  It also will be used to meet our contractual obligations under public private partnerships that deliver parts of our motorway network, to maintain motorways in safe and usable conditions; to undertake safety works and bridge maintenance and rehabilitation, to carry out improvement schemes across the country on some minor roads and to undertake essential routine maintenance such as, for example, signing and lining, verge maintenance and preparatory winter maintenance. <\/p><p> With our partners in Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and various local authorities, we intend to progress the following major Project Ireland 2040 projects during the course of 2019: the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin scheme; the N8 Dunkettle scheme, which will commence construction; the Sligo western distributor road; and road upgrades in the vicinity of Grangecastle Business Park.  Early planning work on the M20 Cork to Limerick scheme also will commence.<\/p><p> Road safety is something which is of paramount importance and our support for the operations of the Road Safety Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety will continue.  Both organisations have achieved a lot in recent years and continued that work in 2018.  Road deaths are a blight on our communities and work undertaken by my Department and by the RSA, with the support and expertise of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, proves that we can influence driving behaviours and minimise the egregious losses that occur on our roads.  This year, 2019, will see a continuation of that vital work.<\/p><p> In terms of maritime activities, we make investments to improve maritime safety and these are seen across the work of the Irish Coast Guard.  They are funded through programme C, our maritime transport and safety programme.  Funding for 2019 is at &euro;103 million or 5% of the Vote.  Most of that funding is directed to the Irish Coast Guard and the main cost here relates to the search and rescue helicopter contract.  The programme also funds the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the body that operate buoys and lighthouses and keep seafarers and their cargoes safe while in Irish waters.  We also cover various administrative costs associated with the Irish maritime administration.  It is important to note that we will be continuing the coast guard building programme to ensure that the volunteers have adequate facilities for their operations and equipment, and we will be investing in IT infrastructure to enable the teams to further enhance how they work together.<\/p><p> Sport is programme D and at &euro;125 million accounts for 6% of the Vote.  This includes provision to deliver on all existing commitments under the sports capital programme and new allocations in respect of applications received under the 2018 round of the programme.  These allocations will be made later this year.  The funding will also cover our existing commitments under the local authority swimming pool programmes and to the Kerry Sports Academy in Tralee, which is due to open this year.  Our new large-scale sport infrastructure fund is currently open for applications.  We plan to announce our first allocations under this programme later this year.<\/p><p> Other priorities for investment in the sports programme over the short to medium term includes supporting high-performance sporting achievement, while also increasing participation in sport and physical activity at all levels.  Last year, we set out our vision for sport in the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.  We are now commencing the implementation of the actions outlined in the policy, which will transform our sporting landscape over the next decade.<\/p><p> Tourism services fall under programme E, which at &euro;169 million, accounts for 7% of the Vote.  It provides for the programme and administrative spend of the two tourism agencies, with F&aacute;ilte Ireland at &euro;69 million and Tourism Ireland at &euro;16 million.  It also includes a &euro;47 million contribution to the tourism marketing fund, &euro;21 million for tourism product development and over &euro;13 million for the development of greenways.  This funding will allow F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to continue to develop and market the tourism industry, including the further development of the signature experience brands like the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  In budget 2019, I secured an additional &euro;35 million, which represents a 26% increase in funding for tourism, which will allow the tourism agencies to provide fresh impetus this year in terms of industry support, product development and marketing of our tourism offering around the world.  Following the expansion of the sector in recent years, we are in the position where we should focus more on sustainable growth.<\/p><p> The Government has allocated almost &euro;8 million, in additional funding, to the tourism agencies to respond to the impact of Brexit.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is implementing a programme that places a focus on retaining business from Northern Ireland and Britain, while also offering supports to enterprises to equip them for the post-Brexit marketplace.  Tourism Ireland is implementing a series of actions in the British market to address the decline in visitor numbers since the Brexit referendum, while also extending its regional access initiative.  Tourism Ireland also continues to roll out its market diversification strategy, which focuses greater resources on attracting visitors from those markets who stay longer and spend more while on holiday. <\/p><p> In 2019, we will build on progress made in recent years, we will push our tourism and sport strategies forward and we will continue to build and prepare for the construction of a more mobile and connected country.  I, like the members, am keen to see advances this year and envisage a result that will see all of Ireland share in the fruits of these proposed investments.  I am more than happy to answer any questions on the 2019 Estimates of expenditure and investment for the services provided by my Department and our partner organisations.<\/p><p> To conclude, I received some adverse comments about not being here last week.  I would like to explain my absence to the committee and I think I should do so.

Did it not pay a dividend of approximately &euro;12 million to the Department last year which the Minister used as part of a supplementary budget?  Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I have the figure wrong because I am working from memory.  Does the Minister envisage there will be a contribution from the IAA this year?

One would imagine they were aware as the overrun at the children's hospital is not something that suddenly became apparent in recent weeks.  Why was money allocated at the beginning of the year for a project the Minister did not envisage would be drawn down?  My concern is there is a disproportionate cut of &euro;30 million to the Department and it is being masked under the heading of the A5 because, as the Minister quite rightly said, there are complications and it will not progress at the speed we would like to see.  Knowing what the Minister knew, and knowing the complications and legal difficulties, why was funding earmarked for the A5 this year if it was never going to be drawn down in the first instance?<\/p> <p>  An increase in funding for the public transport agencies is provided under subhead B9.  I understand this increase would be to agencies such as the National Transport Authority.  Will the Minister clarify what this increase is for?  Is it primarily for the work being done on rolling out BusConnects?  Does it concern Transport Infrastructure Ireland in terms of the work being done on rolling out the metro?  Perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to clarify the position on the metro.  Will it be rolled out as one stand-alone project or will it be divided in two projects?<\/p> <p>  The Minister has identified &euro;7 million for carbon reduction.  Given the fact that transport is the second biggest contributor after agriculture to our global emissions, &euro;7 million is a drop in the ocean.  It is disappointing to note that &euro;1.9 million will be carried over from last year.  Why were we not able to meet our expenditure targets last year?  The Minister has a commitment to retrofit older public transport facilities to accommodate people with varying levels of ability and disability.  Earlier this year, we produced a document to which the Minister contributed and we debated it in the D&aacute;il several weeks ago.  Has the Minister set a clear target on how many public transport facilities will be retrofitted to make sure they are wheelchair accessible and disability friendly?  The Minister has spoken about new innovative ideas to help decarbonise transport, including pilot initiatives.  Perhaps he will share some information on these pilot initiatives with us.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the roads budget, the programme for partnership Government the Minister negotiated includes a commitment to restore roads funding to a steady-state condition.  As the Minister goes into his fourth year in office, this commitment will not be met.

What are the effects of the lack of funding for a steady-state level over recent years?  We have not kept it at a steady level in recent years.  What have been the cumulative defects over recent years?<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to update the committee on the tendering process for additional rail carriages.  I know, as I am sure my colleagues also know from their engagements with Irish Rail, that the company's assets have been sweated within an inch of their lives.

It is just a matter of staff.  There is increased activity in these agencies.  It is a matter of taking on new staff.  It is nothing more or less than that.  The agencies need the right number of staff and extra resources in order to take on the projects.  Delivering the national development plan demands many more skills and many more people.  That is what the increased spending is about.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy also referred steady state.  Safety is always prioritised in spending on rail.  Maintaining a steady state did fall behind.  This meant that non-priority issues had to be deferred.  Deputy Troy has returned; I am just getting to his stuff.  We were not in a position to do as much track relaying or ballast cleaning as we had hoped.  Now that rail is in a steady state, we are going ahead with many other purchases and with spending and investment.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland will reach a steady-state situation in the context of national roads in 2021.  On regional and local roads, steady state should be achieved by 2023.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with the rail fleet before dealing with retrofitting for accessibility.  The NTA recently advertised for 60 to 80 second-hand rail carriages, either for lease or purchase, for delivery by February 2020.  The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are also exploring options to place an order for additional intermediate carriages for the existing rail fleet, for delivery by the middle of 2021.  This would boost capacity on medium-distance commuter lines in the greater Dublin area in particular.<\/p> <p>  On the A5 project, the Deputy has asked whether we knew about the issue in advance and, if so, whether provision had been made in respect of it.  We knew that there might be a deferral or something of that nature, but we were in no way aware of the extent of what would be involved.  It was considered prudent to provide for it in the budget last October.  As it turned out, a certain amount was available, which was lucky.  It would have been very imprudent not to provide for it because the money could still have had to be spent this year.<\/p><p>Core challenges have meant that it was postponed.<\/p><p> On retrofitting, accessibility features such as wheelchair access and audiovisual aids are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage.  All new buses purchased by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann for urban centres are low-floor, wheelchair accessible vehicles.  Grant support for the introduction in the taxi fleet of more wheelchair accessible vehicles is available.  There is a retrofit accessibility capital allocation of &euro;7 million for 2019.  With regard to rail, we fund an ongoing programme to upgrade existing older infrastructure and facilities, including train stations, to make them accessible to wheelchair users.  This retrofit programme is managed by the NTA.  Some &euro;3 million was provided for rail station accessibility upgrades for 2019.  This funding is triple the previous allocation for accessibility.<\/p><p> Irish Rail has two wheelchair accessible platforms at 118 stations and one wheelchair accessible platform at 26 stations.  Work remains to be done to retrofit older infrastructural facilities, for example, Victorian era train stations, to make them accessible for people with disabilities.  Making all stations fully accessible in addition to being wheelchair accessible would include ticketing and audio and visual information systems.  An accessibility audit for Irish Rail in 2014 identified 54 stations then requiring upgrades to make them fully accessible at a cost of &euro;79 million.  The company has since undertaken some works at all 54 stations, as well as accessibility works at other stations across the network.  However, Irish Rail would need to complete a new feasibility study to ascertain the cost of providing full accessibility at all stations across the network.  I anticipate people will say that full accessibility has not yet been achieved.  That is our objective, however, and we have made significant strides in that regard.  We have increased funding and we are committed to this programme and achieving full accessibility eventually.  While we have made significant progress, I acknowledge that it is definitely not enough and there is further to go.<\/p><p> I am happy to tell the committee all I know about MetroLink.  It has been an issue for a long time in the D&aacute;il and other fora.  There has been much speculation about the project on which many people have lobbied and for which there have been various plans.  The NTA will come forward with a new plan in two or three weeks.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, will produce a new plan, having taken into consideration much of the ongoing public consultation.  I met the NTA a couple of weeks ago and I met the TII in the same week.  They gave me an outline of the possible implications of certain options.  They have not made a decision.  One option in the outline was for very long closures for metro south, on the green line, which were unacceptable.  In one case, part of the line could have been  closed for four years.  That would be substituted by alternatives which I did not regard as satisfactory, including buses taking people from to and from the points of closure.  I made it clear to both agencies that closures of this duration or of a much shorter duration were unacceptable and would cause gridlock in the area in question.  They agreed to come back with a more concrete plan but left with no doubt that we would not allow lengthy closures.  That is the current position and we expect the NTA and TII to come back with a proposal in the coming weeks.  The date mentioned was, I believe, 20 March but members should not hold me to that.  That is the position and I think we will make progress on the issue.  Many public consultations are taking place on all aspects of MetroLink.  The committee will find that decisions have to be made shortly.  What I can say definitively is that if undue closures are proposed, the plan will not be acceptable.  However, I do not expect that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#J00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>Will the Minister define the word \"undue\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#K00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I do not want to put a complete time on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#K00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>I understand that, but four years-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#K00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>Four years was mentioned, then two years, and I told the NTA and TII that it was not on because it would mean it would be almost impossible to bring people in and out of work in a tolerable time.

It indicated it will recruit additional staff.  I presume the increase in funding for public transport agencies is to cater for increased recruitment.  Will the Minister confirm that?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that 60 to 70 new rail carriages will be ordered.  My understanding from speaking with the NTA and Irish Rail is that Irish Rail originally hoped to acquire second-hand carriages but it felt this would be an inefficient use of resources given the lead-in time involved and the time needed to recondition the carriages.  As a result, it has decided to wait and order new, purpose-built carriages.  Capacity on Irish Rail is a serious issue.  When will that tender go out?  Has the Minister a clear timeframe for when the order will be placed?  There is a lead-in of 24 months from when the order is placed.  It is critical that the tender is published and the order placed in the not too distant future.<\/p><p>The Minister gave a good overview of retrofitting and what has been done on disability services.  I acknowledge that.  Have we a clear programme of work?  In the next three, four or five years, we intend to make every public transport facility wheelchair-accessible and to have the right audio and other enabling equipment so everyone, regardless of disability level, will be catered for.<\/p><p> If the Minister has answered my next question, I apologise.  On carbon reduction, Ireland had a great responsibility to change its method of transport and acknowledge it has a carbon emissions problem.  Transport is the second biggest contributor in Ireland.  A sum of &euro;7 million to tackle it seems like a drop in the ocean.  A carryover of &euro;1.9 million last year leads me to believe the Department is not treating this matter as seriously as is required and with sufficient priority.  If we do not meet our targets by 2020, how much will we be fined?  I accept it will not just be the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#K01000","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1242,"content":"<p>I have a question on electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the carbon footprint.  There is a great need for considerable investment in this infrastructure.  I understand there are only six public charging points in Drogheda.

What plan, if any, has the Department to work with the ESB or others to have a proper, first-rate network around the country?  The main issue is that people want to buy electric cars but they have range anxiety because they are not certain that if they drive over 200 km, to places they do not normally go, they will be able to charge them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#L00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1243,"content":"<p>The Chairman made a good point in that we lack charging points.  They are difficult to find sometimes.  There are not enough of them.  The ESB has announced impressive plans recently to invest in the fast-charging network and upgrade the on-street parking network.  This would be a major boost to electric vehicle acceptance.  Fees should be considered only in the context of this step change in the quality and coverage of the charging network.  We have got a plan.  The ESB has made the plan and there is a real commitment to implementing it.<\/p> <p>  The local emission vehicle task force was established in 2016 to consider the range of measures and options available to the Government to accelerate the take-up of low-carbon technology in the road transport sector.  This has been reasonably successful, but perhaps not successful enough, in terms of the take-up of electric vehicles.  It started from a very low base.  I have some statistics that might be useful to the Deputy.   In 2018, a total of 1,972 new electric vehicles were registered, bringing the total number in Ireland to almost 7,650 by the end of December 2018.  This year, 2019, is seeing a continuation in the rise of electric vehicle numbers.  In the first two months, 1,128 new battery electric vehicles were registered by comparison with 176 in the same period last year.  The way things are moving is pretty staggering.  There is a low base, which I admit.  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle sales are also increasing, with 472 vehicles registered in January and February compared with 185 last year.  There are now almost 9,500 electric vehicles on Irish roads.<\/p> <p>  I will make a general comment on carbon reduction.  It is important to note that while the carbon reduction programme has a vital role to play in transport emissions mitigation efforts, it is only one small element of a far wider range of transport measures being implemented to help to reduce emissions, including a range of incentives to encourage a transition from conventional fuels to lower-emission alternatives, such as electric vehicles; increasing the proportion of biofuels in the mix; improving efficiency standards for vehicles; and the significantly enhanced funding we are making available to support the development of new, improved public and sustainable transport infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy raised the delay in the drawing down of funding in 2018.  The programme drew down only &euro;697,000 due to a number of factors.  It sounds very disappointing, and I suppose it is, but there were production delays that deferred the delivery of nine hybrid buses until 2019.  There were procurement delays in facilitating a small-scale pilot programme for alternatively fuelled rural buses.  The cost will arise in 2019 instead.  It is not because of a lack of commitment but because there were unavoidable delays.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of public transport, I answered Deputy Troy's question on staff when he was out.  The increases associated with the running of the agencies are because we obviously need, because of the national development plan and the expansion of the bodies' roles, greater expertise and more staff.  This has increased the costs.  We have given more money for that purpose.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about disability and accessibility.  The Deputy is seeking a commitment in this regard.  It is always dangerous to make concrete commitments on every last item.  Our aim - I do not believe we have let anybody down in this regard - is full accessibility; it is nothing short of that.  We still have mountains to climb in terms of some of the buses that are not equipped and other areas where there is not full accessibility.  We are making progress, however, and we are making commitments.  This committee was very active in this regard.  It is pushing many people in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  There is commitment.  The Deputy knows that I put on every transport board an advocate with personal experience of disability.  This was not for the sake of it; it actually puts pressure on the bodies to deliver.  They seek to deliver what we are promising also.  While we are making great strides, we have still a good way to go.  I admit that and covered it in my opening speech.  There are gaps but our ambition is to fill them as soon as possible.  The funding has been committed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#L00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1244,"content":"<p>The Minister said in his statement that the PSO funding is at a steady state.

There was a commitment to address that during the year.  Has the Minister figures for how the Coast Guard facilities have been upgraded or improved in the last 12 months?<\/p> <p>  I take this opportunity to reiterate our concern, and we are due to hold a committee meeting on this, about the recent decision which prevents the Coast Guard volunteers from using the blue flashing light.  We thought it was a disastrous decision.  We do not know who took it.  In 99.9% of instances, these people are responding to an emergency that is a time sensitive, life threatening issue.  They are giving their time freely and perhaps leaving their places of work or homes.  It is of paramount importance that they reach their destination in a timely manner.  The decision to suspend the use of the blue flashing light was regrettable.  I understand, and perhaps the Minister will correct me, that a decision has been taken to offer the members of the Coast Guard training in the use of the blue light with a view to reinstating that facility in the service.  However, according to my correspondence or engagement with the Coast Guard volunteers, the Irish Coast Guard is not on the list of clients of the company that provides this blue light training.  Can the Minister confirm that the decision to prevent Irish Coast Guard volunteers from using the blue light will be rescinded and that the volunteers will receive adequate training to use the blue light in future?<\/p> <p>  In addition, how has the Coast Guard building programme improved in the last 12 months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#N00200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1271,"content":"<p>Yes, I can confirm that training will be provided.  I will outline the up-to-date situation.  The Coast Guard is a fantastic organisation.  Everybody wants to do what is best for the Coast Guard to make it work efficiently, and for its members to be content with what they are doing and not to hinder them in their work in any way.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of basic facilities such as toilets, running water and Internet, almost two thirds of Coast Guard units have basic facilities, including bathrooms, running water and so forth.  Most of the remaining buildings are old rocket houses which were never intended to be anything other than storage units.  The building programme is seeking to target capital investment on enhancing the units most in need.  Unfortunately, some buildings are simply not suitable for such enhancement in terms of their location, building regulations or other safety considerations.  In such cases the Irish Coast Guard, IRCG, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, OPW, is seeking alternative sites or solutions for the units.  There are 16 IRCG units in total without full sanitation facilities.  That is not satisfactory and will have to be improved.  However, there have been improvements to two thirds of the units.<\/p> <p>  Due to the nature and size of the rocket house buildings, their current land footprint and their unique locations, it is not always feasible to upgrade or extend these premises.  My officials have asked the OPW to conduct individual building assessments of IRCG unit stations currently without facilities to ascertain the best solutions available, including temporary solutions for the ten units already included in the OPW building and building maintenance programmes and permanent solutions for the remaining six rocket house sub-stations.  All 53 stations will be provided with laptops and printers this year by IT people in the Department and all 53 officers-in-charge now have Internet enabled mobile devices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#N00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1272,"content":"<p>There are 16 buildings without sanitation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#N00400","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1273,"content":"<p>Yes, but the intention is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#N00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>All of those 16 buildings are used by volunteers.

When will that be announced?  Can the Minister tell us the criteria he will use to assess applications?  There is no doubt that both schemes will be oversubscribed, as is always the case.  Will the Minister give a commitment that local community groups will not be discommoded by the fact they are in a rural area?

Our ambition is certainly to have sports grants every year.  They are a wonderful facility and I have seen that the competition for the money is incredible.  They are put to very good use.  It is a really effective way of getting money to people who participate in sport.  It is one of the most compelling and satisfying mechanisms whereby money is spent and spent well on young people, their mental and physical health and abilities.  It would be preferable if we had this every year although we have not been able to do so.  I think we had it in 2016 and 2018 and we have another lot coming out this year.  We would certainly like to have it every year if we could.<\/p><p>On boxing, it is a delicate issue.  The Deputy really wants to address the issue of the International Olympic Committee, IOC, suspending planning for the 2020 Olympic boxing tournament.  International sporting organisations such as the IOC are independent, autonomous bodies that are responsible for deciding their own operational procedures and competition rules.  It is not the role of any government to intervene in such decision making.  Sport Ireland and the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, are continuing to work collaboratively in preparing our Irish boxers for Tokyo 2020 and are monitoring the situation closely.  The IOC will not make a final decision until this coming June.  There is an expectation there will be a boxing competition at the Tokyo Olympics, but probably not under the IABA banner.<\/p><p>Deputy Troy asked me to lay out the criteria that will be used for the sports capital programme this year.  That has not been decided yet but there is no intention to discriminate against anybody.  It has been done in the past on a<i>per capita<\/i>basis.  I have not heard much quarrel with that but there are all sorts of alternative ways of doing it, such as placing a high bar for people to get over before they can get anything at all.  There are numerous ways in which it could be done.  However, I have not heard a large number of complaints about how it has been distributed in the past.  We are looking at various ways of doing it.  We could change the weightings a bit.  Maybe the disadvantaged should get a little bit more than they did in the past.  We are strongly considering the possibility of disadvantaged areas being given a greater share.  However, we have not made any decision on it yet.<\/p><p>The large-scale sporting infrastructure scheme is open to applications until 17 April.  This will take some time and I will not promise a date for completing that but I am sure it will be well into the second half of the year.  There will be a serious assessment.  This is a fund of &euro;100 million, with &euro;8.8 million allocated for this year.  They are very large projects and will have to be looked at extremely seriously and very thoroughly, which will take some time.  There are a couple of streams for that as well.  We will look at it as discretely as we can as we do not want to see a deficit in the draw-downs.  It is a very exciting prospect.  We will approach this forensically, strictly and objectively.  At the end of the day, the projects will be very worthy but they will be very big ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#O00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1286,"content":"<p>I do not want to be in any way critical of the manner of distribution of the money.  I am very happy with the way it is done.  However, if we broadened the number of people, clubs and organisations that can apply for the sports capitation grant, it would broaden the base, for example, if applications could come through schools and the like.  The applications opened in 2018 and there was a window to get an application in but some clubs and schools said they would wait for the next round because they would not have their application properly in order for the deadline.  We are into the second year of determining the current applications.  The process is too drawn out and many clubs and organisations wait too long for an opportunity to apply.

There will be no political interference of any sort; this will be decided by people outside politics.  I will sign off on it because that is my job but I will not be interfering one way or the other.  It will be left to officials as it was before.

Some of the extra &euro;35 million is being used by the tourist agencies.  They are concentrating on Brexit.  The effect of Brexit on tourism could be very damaging.  We have already seen a drop in sterling.  That will, initially anyway, discourage people from Britain coming over here.  That &euro;35 million, therefore, is being used in all sorts of different ways to counter the ill effects on tourism.  Much of the money is also going on enterprise supports, festivals, events and business tourism.  As the committee is aware, there money is also going on greenways.  That is a big ticket item this year.  I think &euro;13 million has been allocated to greenways.<\/p> <p>  Let me just give the figures for the tourism agencies.  Some &euro;7.9 million in the additional funding was allocated to the tourism agencies to ensure the tourism sector is Brexit-ready.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will implement a programme placing a focus on retaining business from Northern Ireland and Britain, while also offering supports to equip enterprises for the post-Brexit marketplace.  Tourism Ireland will implement a review of its operations in the British market and also extend its regional access initiative.  Additional funding is also being allocated to Tourism Ireland to implement strategies for growth in new and developing markets in the US and Germany.  This will help to build and sustain growth in these markets in line with the Government's Global Ireland 2025 strategy.<\/p> <p>  We were definitely aware when it came to budget time that tourism needed protection and &euro;35 million was a fairly large injection.  Much of that has gone to the tourism agencies of course.  I think they will use it well.  The indications at the moment are that they are using it well already and the product is still immensely successful.  We are optimistic, despite the obviously challenges to tourism.  We have brands such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, the new Lakelands brand and the Hidden Heartlands - which is very dear to Deputy Troy's heart.  We think we will still manage to have a successful season, despite the difficulties presented by external forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019030600002#P05200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1551879000,"counter":1343,"content":"<p>I now move on to appropriations-in-aid.
