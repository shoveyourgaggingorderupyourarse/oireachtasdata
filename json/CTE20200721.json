F&oacute;rsa represents health and social care professionals including physiotherapists, orthoptists, and speech and language therapists.  Our orthoptists were trained in swab testing and carried out such tests on the front line.

We want to talk about the significant effect this had across the health sector, primarily with regard to our own grades but also for all others.  A common refrain of the trade union movement is that an injury to one is an injury to all.  In healthcare, particularly during a pandemic, an infection for one has an effect on everyone, both in the acute and community settings.  Our submission reflects on that and on the rates of infection.

We believe it is time for the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, to be involved and that an examination of the high infection rate among healthcare workers must be examined by the statutory agency tasked with this particular responsibility.

We urge this committee to ensure that the regulation preventing the HSA from doing just that is altered and the Minister with responsibility puts before the House the regulation changes.  It is very simple.  It is a statutory instrument and it needs to be done immediately because there is no way an employer in the public or private sector should be the only authority that determines whether it has acted in a correct manner when it comes to its workers' welfare.  We do not believe that should be the case.  It is not fair to healthcare workers.  We appreciate, as we have said publicly previously, the applause and the well-intentioned thanks healthcare workers have received but right now, facing into doing this again, our members are saying they are exhausted and cannot endure this again with the protections that were in place.

As a society, we waited for the pandemic to arrive before we reacted.

Staff in the health service, similar to staff in other sectors of the economy, require their total earnings to be able to survive.  The point we were making in including this point in the submission was to draw attention to a policy that did not work because it served as a disincentive.

The problem is that we are still awaiting a funded workforce plan.  It is something we have sought and it needs to be put in place.  We have guarantees, for example, that both Covid and non-Covid services will have to be provided.<\/p><p>We have sought that the workforce reflects that.  If I was a nurse in an emergency department tonight, I would be providing either a Covid or non-Covid service.  There are not two of me but there are two services.  That is for the very reason the Deputy just outlined.<\/p><p> The important point about this virus is that it does not discriminate.  Its aim is to infect people so we have to make sure we prevent it from doing that.  If that means some members of the workforce having to remain outside it, the health service has to make provision to supplement the remaining workforce.  What happened recently is that there was nobody to call on and, therefore, those who were at work were working short-handed.  Ms Murphy can attest to that.  There were 19 nurses on her ward.  Twelve of them got infected and were absent from that ward, but the patient load did not decrease.  We know from WHO statistics that infection rates are higher among those who are fatigued.  The nurses who remained on that ward were exposed to a higher risk of infection purely because of fatigue.  We need a funded workforce plan for nursing and midwifery.  Fianna F&aacute;il's pre-Government submission sought to increase the workforce quite substantially.  We are eager to have that conversation.  We are meeting the Minister this afternoon and will raise that with him, as well as with the HSE.

We have to look seriously at reintroducing the public provision of care of older persons.  We cannot rely on the private sector to the level we have.  Some 82% of all care of the older person services is provided by the private sector and the workforce is not sufficient to endure another flu or another wave of Covid-19.

There are some caveats attached to that, for obvious reasons.  However, we are satisfied that the figures we have received from the HSE reflect the reality.  For example, the most recent figures collated last Friday show that 8,347 healthcare workers have been infected with Covid-19.  Of those, the highest single group is nurses, with 2,711 infections.  We have experienced that on our wards, and Ms Murphy experienced it personally.  There are a number of reasons for the high infection rate.  One is that there was a deficit of PPE to begin with, though that has improved and is no longer the issue.  The biggest single issue is fatigue and the length of exposure of healthcare workers, such as nurses and midwives, to people with the infection.  The longer someone is exposed to somebody with the infection, the more likely that person is to become infected.

I gave evidence before the committee previously, and in our survey nurses give testimony on this point, of nurses being instructed not to wear face masks.  This was simply the wrong policy.

Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha said in her opening statement and submission that a long-term process will be required to deal with the psychological impact that all of this has had on nurses and front-line staff, that it is in this phase that many staff will be running on empty and that it is important to be able to respond to the needs of staff and support them.  She also said that if a new surge of the virus emerges, the health service must have the workforce to deliver services and adequate supports.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline specifically what needs to be done to support front-line workers, whether because of the psychological impact, physical impact or whatever?  What practical supports in the here and now will be needed?<\/p> <p>  I am not sure whether the witnesses saw the sessions we had last week with the HSE, when we spoke about capacity and the obvious fact that we still have to deal with Covid in our acute hospital settings.  There may well be a surge but even the levels there at present require a lot of attention from front-line staff.  We also have all of the ongoing non-Covid care.  We have the programme to catch up on all of the missed care, which is necessary.  How will any of this be done with the current capacity?  It just cannot be done.  Will the witnesses give us their view on what is needed in the short term in terms of beds, staff and other supports, such as physical infrastructure?  What is needed in the coming months and the next year in our health service to ensure we can deal with Covid and non-Covid care and have some chance of dealing with the catch-up programme?  I know it is a general question but it is an important one with regard to what is needed in the here and now.<\/p> <p>  My specific question was to Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha on the survey and the more general broader point on capacity is for all of the witnesses if they want to respond to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#H00400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595286000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>In the here and now, the respondents to our survey made it very clear that a telephone helpline is not sufficient.<\/p><p>They want practical post-traumatic stress support.

What it puts back on the staff is that they work two streams whereby sometimes Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients are put through one piece of equipment - one CT scanner one MRI scanner - as fast as possible so no-one is waiting on a trolley and patients are admitted quickly so there is no crossover between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  We are not nearly at burnout, we are at burnout.

I received quite a number of emails at a very early stage from people on the front line who wanted to wear face masks, but it appears that a decision was taken at a local level, by individual medical units, nursing homes or whatever, that masks were not required.  Did the witnesses hear from people who had made requests that those in charge of a particular ward, hospital or nursing home ruled against that rather than there being a diktat from a central body such as the HSE?<\/p><p><b>Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha:<\/b>I will answer that.  The policy of the HSE was quite specific on the wearing of face masks, and it was not broad enough.  The policy was quoted to nurses when they sought to wear face masks and the wearing of face masks in the particular setting that they were in contravened the policy.  At national level we had to change the policy.  As I said, the policy was changed on 22 April to allow the widespread wearing of face masks, something that should have been the case from the beginning. <\/p><p>In respect of the question on underlying health conditions posed by the Deputy, healthcare workers got infected because of the exposure rate.  They, no more than any other section of the population, include those with underlying health conditions.  <\/p><p>The biggest issue we faced was nurses who were pregnant and attending work.  We had a battle to ensure that they were not exposed.  Pregnancy was not considered an underlying health condition.  Some 34% of all of healthcare worker infections were among nurses.<\/p><p>Treating a pregnant woman with Covid-19 is very difficult and should never even be contemplated.  We had a huge problem in trying to get pregnant nurses and midwives redeployed away from the front line.  That problem was exacerbated because underlying staffing levels do not support redeployment.<\/p><p> We also had a call from the private sector to redeploy public servants, particularly nurses and midwives, into the private sector when it was short of staff.  Personal protective equipment, PPE, was a problem in the private sector and policies and procedures, etc., were unfortunately absent in some cases.  The exposure of healthcare workers is the point.  It cannot be left to the employers and must be looked at by an agency with the statutory authority to examine it.  An employer constantly suggesting reasons something has happened is simply not good enough.  We must have stronger and better protections for healthcare workers on a legislative basis.  They deserve the same protections as any other worker in this country and should not be treated less favourably.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#K00800","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will move on to consider how we go forward.

There cannot be cutbacks on front-line staff in a service that is delivered by people.  We have a shortage now that is estimated at just under 5,000 nurses and midwives.

The issue with hand sanitiser arose because of reliance on a single source.

Listening to the witnesses' contributions, I find it shocking and frightening that they seem to be saying that healthcare workers on the front line are working unsafe hours with unsafe staffing levels and are being put under pressure to go to work even when they have underlying conditions, or for financial reasons.  If that persists, we are in deep trouble if there is a second wave, as is likely, in the autumn.  Is that a fair assessment of what the witnesses are telling us?  I would like to hear from Ms Murphy on this.  Does she feel the lessons are being learnt about what happened to her and the experience she has gone through?

I unjustifiably contracted Covid-19 in the workplace due to, as was previously said, understaffing, being completely overwhelmed with the role of the nurse, extreme burnout and overexposure to the virus.  I believe I was competent in my use of PPE; we had extensive training and education on the ward from infection prevention and control in the hospital on a daily basis, as PPE did change depending on supply.<\/p> <p>  On being prepared for a second surge, as nurses we are professionals.  Speaking from the perspective of my own hospital, I cannot say that any of my colleagues presented to the ward with symptoms of Covid-19.  There was a very clear pathway whereby a person isolated, he or she got a swab through occupational health in work, got his or her result and subsequently was off work for 14 days if not longer.  In my case, it was for 12 weeks due to symptoms.  Going forward, the psychological impact of Covid-19 has been detrimental to me and to my colleagues and I am sure I can speak on behalf of the nurses of Ireland when I say that.  Being given a telephone number or an app to access from home for psychological trauma, for post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, which was mentioned, is just not sufficient.<\/p> <p>  We need significant debriefing going forward.  Our mortality rate was incredibly high.  We as nurses work to save lives but we were fighting a losing battle at the very start of Covid-19 and we do not want to see that again.  I personally do not think I can walk into a workplace that is unsafe and that is how I felt at times, even though I was provided with PPE and I was, as I said, competent with it.  To me, the workplace was a hazard.  I ended up in hospital for a week due to my symptoms, which escalated out of my control and I had to be monitored and investigated as an inpatient in the hospital where I work, where just a week previously I would have been standing as a nurse at the bedside providing care to dying patients who succumbed to Covid-19.  It was extremely traumatising and I do not know if any nurse could overcome that with just a number or an app.  More needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I wish to thank Ms Siobh&aacute;n Murphy so much, on behalf of all of us, for what she has done.<\/p> <p>  Does she believe that lessons have been learned by the HSE and the Government from the rather harrowing experience she has clearly gone through?

They have done an incredible job.  At last Friday's committee meeting, I said that I thought a level of exasperation was quite evident over the course of the day.  It has been evident at this committee for a while and is evident again here today.  Anyone listening to the evidence and reading the submissions could not but be exasperated.  We can all accept that there was a level of unpreparedness because no one knew what was around the corner.  What I am concerned with now is what we have learnt and what we are implementing before the winter.  I have some background in infection control.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha said the HSE asked for masks to be worn on 22 April.  I asked for them to be mandated in the D&aacute;il on 4 April.  There were things we could have been doing regarding PPE.  It was also stated that hand sanitiser is only available through one supplier.  However, most of the distilleries in the country have been providing alcohol hand sanitiser, so there should be absolutely no reason not to have hand sanitiser in the healthcare sector.  I encourage the unions that are present to get in contact with HSE procurement and to talk about these issues.  I have worked with a number of companies in Ireland that are having great difficulty in bringing PPE into the supply network because of government procurement.  These things must be addressed.  I have sat in hospital waiting areas and have looked at staff migrating through hospitals with their scrubs on, going down into community areas and back up to the wards.  That must come to a stop, as must allowing public transit through all areas of a hospital.  Infection control procedures must be put in place.  They are the very first front-line policies, about which the witnesses must speak to the Minister very robustly.<\/p> <p>  I also previously mentioned temperature testing.  Has the INMO any opinion on whether staff should be temperature tested before they start work in the morning, just as they are in other industries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#Q00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595286000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that temperature testing has a place but we are more worried about asymptomatic presentations, that is, people who present with no symptoms but who are infectious.  We and the other health sector unions have jointly asked the HSE to change its policy of advising staff who are close contacts of a case but have no symptoms to come back to work.  We believe that is unsafe.  We need swabbing and we need to know the status of workers.  In the private sector, there is now mandatory staff swabbing but we do not have such a policy in the public acute hospital system.  HSE officials will speak to the committee later and they will say, as they have said to us, that a swab is just a picture in time.  However, we believe it is necessary because we know that asymptomatic workers in the private sector are being picked up as positive, and when they are asymptomatic and positive, they still pass the virus on to others.  A temperature is one symptom that can have a number of different causes, but the swabbing of front-line workers must be mandatory in the acute service as well as the private sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha"},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I agree with Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha wholeheartedly on that.

I again ask the witnesses to speak to the HSE about that because these are simple measures to implement.  The very first priority is that workers need to be protected.  Everybody accepts that.  We cannot protect from everything but we can mitigate as far as possible.  The INMO should also talk to the HSE about more flexible rotas.  Perhaps nurses should only do four hours on and four hours off, with some kind of alternate shift change to reduce the level of fatigue and thereby reduce the rate of infection.  I applaud everything the witnesses are doing.  I feel sorry for front-line workers who have been caught up in this and I also feel sorry that we are not learning from the mistakes of the past.

The swabbing of staff in the private sector followed the presentation of symptoms.  If there were symptomatic presentations then swabbing followed.  In the public sector in care of the older person services, it depended very much on the availability of swabbing facilities.  For example, Cherry Orchard Hospital has a laboratory on-site and swabbed its staff who presented with symptoms.  It had a very good experience of Covid, if we could call it a good experience.  In other words, the infection rate was quite low and the transfer of the infection to other staff was kept at a minimum.  It also enforced quite strictly the policy of self-isolation for 14 days.  Even though the HSE's policy was that close contacts could be derogated to return to work, Cherry Orchard Hospital took decisions not to implement this.  I know this because I spoke to one of the assistant directors who felt it was very important not to derogate staff to come back when they did not know their status and had not been swabbed.  We have requested this policy to be removed.  Today, if a member of the public is a close contact he or she will be advised to stay at home and self-isolate for 14 days.

We have not had sight of any plan for a second wave is the explicit answer to the question.  I earlier explained one of the reasons for that.  When the national emergency struck, there was a command and control model and a mobilisation of the workforce to do something we had never done before.  A second wave, if there is one, will come in different circumstances.  On the positive side, we will be better equipped from the points of view of tracing and identifying contacts, and we know more about the illness.  On the negative side, we have handed back 300 beds and do not have a workforce plan of which we have had sight.  People would be wrong to think that it is possible to have a new command and control model that will have the same effect.  The difference will be that there have been delays in cancer diagnostics for a number of months.  Therapeutic interventions for vulnerable people have been delayed for a number of months and disability services have closed down for a number of months.  The system will be unable to absorb that.  We will go into a second wave while having to keep the other services I have mentioned open.  It is beyond me how the HSE's Be on Call for Ireland initiative only yielded 125 staff members.  That is staggering.  It will not be possible to do the job and keep the health services live with an extra 125 people.  If the civil and public service model and Be on Call for Ireland initiative are our staffing sources, those staff members need to go to areas of need.  The HSE needs to get on top of that.<\/p> <p>  That is how we should prepare for a second wave.  It is high time that preparation was tabled for discussion and not in a command and control manner.  We should expect a second wave and expect to be able to deal with it alongside the provision of the rest of the health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595286000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I might come in on the question.

We now have two scientific policies, which have thankfully been adopted as Government policy.  These determine scientifically the staffing, including the ratio and mix, required.

What we need now is to ensure that the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform back it up and that they fund the workforce plans.

There is a tool for achieving that, which is Government policy.  The Government has stated that it will fund it, but we have not seen any evidence in that regard.  The funded workforce plan is required and we need engagement with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform on it.  The Deputy is correct because it needs to be based on science. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#Y00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I have a relative-in-law who is in a nursing home.

The problem is that when people are selecting a nursing home, they look for one near where they live and they do not know anything else about it.  They go in and sign the contract of care, but there is no mandatory requirement on the nursing home, whether public or private, to say what its staffing levels are or whether there are other ancillary services such as speech therapy, physiotherapy, and so on.  One will always find there is a charge of &euro;10 or &euro;20 a week for something that many people cannot avail of because 70% of the people in our nursing homes have dementia.  There is a huge lack of transparency about the &euro;60,000 or more that people pay for their care.

Of the 26,076 Covid cases, 8,347, or 32%, were healthcare workers, with 319 hospitalised, 49 admitted to ICU and, very tragically, seven deaths.  We are agreed that 30% of the cases were in nursing homes, residential institutions and community hospital long-stay units.  We are all working from the same figures.  Only 8.6% of cases are linked to an outbreak in a hospital.  I wanted to set out these figures.  In another submission, we have information that the difference between hospitals and the other settings is likely due to more robust supply chains for PPE in hospitals.  I am very sensitive to the presence today of Ms Murphy who, along with her colleagues, was using PPE but contracted Covid-19 at some point.  She said that 12 out of 19 of her colleagues contracted it in circumstances where they had been using PPE in a hospital.  I want to ask a policy question and perhaps come back to Ms Murphy afterwards.<\/p><p>We have separate data which show that 56% of our nursing homes have no cases of Covid-19.

That person could then get a call to say we are very short-staffed and he or she must come in.  If the person is asked if he or she has a temperature and says \"No\" they are asked to come back to work.  That flies in the face of the public health advice.  We have sought the removal of that policy.

We have a reduction in the number of registrations which I presented at the last committee.

I am sure what I will say today will resonate with a lot of nurses across the country.  I hope I will have made some impact on how we can improve the service if, God forbid, there is a second surge.<\/p> <p>  We went from being a 31-bed surgical ward to a Covid-positive only ward overnight.  Only Covid-positive patients were admitted to our ward.  We took on the task of the full multidisciplinary team as it did its remote reviews of patients.  We were on the ward, at bedsides, 24 hours a day.  It was an honour to care for patients.  We love our job; that is why we are there.  We bridged communications between patients and families using iPads, something we never had to do previously.  The list is extensive; I could go on and on. <\/p> <p>  I will discuss the biggest change for me and my colleagues who contracted Covid-19.  I contracted Covid on 30 April, six weeks after we became a Covid ward.  I became a statistic when I tested positive for Covid-19.  Initially, I was upset and quite angry, and that was the experience of my colleagues across the board.  As I said, I followed hospital protocol and was competent in the use of PPE, but the emotions I initially felt were buried by the physical impact of Covid-19.  I was crippled with fatigue, bed bound with headaches and had extreme shortness of breath, which caused great distress as I felt like I was suffocating.  Many of my colleagues had the same symptoms. <\/p> <p>  I could not talk to my family or friends over the phone.  I was in complete isolation.  I lost my sense of taste and smell.  Simple tasks such as washing and dressing or making a snack for myself were unachievable as I was completely debilitated.  I presented to the emergency department about a week later because I was deteriorating at home.  I was terrified.  I have no underlying conditions, as I said, so it was a huge shock for me to be a patient in the emergency department in the hospital that I work in. <\/p> <p>  I was subsequently admitted for what I thought would be one or two nights' observation, but I was kept in for a week.  I had a series of blood tests.  I underwent a chest X-ray and a CT scan of my lungs, kidneys and other organs to rule out any damage that can be caused by Covid-19.  As I said, there is no pattern.  I was on a heart monitor 24 hours a day for six days because my heart rate increased to 170 bpm.  Medical staff told me this was one of the post-viral effects of the illness.<\/p><p>I was negative for coronavirus at that stage but still had post-viral effects.  The normal heart rate would be 60 to 80 beats per minute.  I was on intravenous fluids to rehydrate me and received daily injections to ensure that I did not develop a blood clot which my experience as a nurse tells me can be potentially fatal.  That was a worry.<\/p><p> The days and nights were extremely long in isolation.  My concentration was massively affected and I was unable to pay any attention to a television that was playing in the background.  I was relieved to get home about a week after I was admitted.  Recovering in isolation is challenging both physically and mentally, as I have stated.  I was unprepared for the psychological impact of contracting and living with Covid-19.  It has definitely prolonged my road to recovery but I know I will get there and, hopefully, go back to work with my health at 100%.<\/p><p> For the first time, I experienced acute anxiety and panic attacks.  I have ongoing insomnia.  I can sleep for eight hours some nights but others I only sleep two to three hours, and I do not know why.  I had vivid hallucinations at the start, as did some of my colleagues.  That is not spoken about as a side effect.  Everybody tends to speak about the physical signs and symptoms but the psychological effects, as I have said, are just as detrimental to recovery.<\/p><p> Twelve weeks on, I still have not returned to my pre-Covid health and still experience some fatigue.  I will be fine one day and have to take an afternoon nap the next.  Shortness of breath comes and goes.  I am awaiting a lung function test to rule out a lasting impact from Covid.  I am also very lucky that I have had physiotherapy input.  I liaise with the hospital physiotherapy service to regain my strength and that will help to get me back to work eventually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy for outlining that for us; the committee really appreciates it.

I will, however, make a few opening comments.  As an organisation, we take very seriously our responsibility to safeguard all our staff and all our patient clientele.  That is a fundamental aspect of our role as an organisation.  Clearly, the people around this table are intimately involved in that.  <\/p> <p>  We cannot express our gratitude to, and pride in, all the staff in the health system and those who have joined from outside for how they have performed over recent months.  They have worked way beyond what anybody could have expected.  They have put in days and weeks of immense work in dealing with this problem for the people of Ireland.  As members will be aware, we have come out of it fairly well compared with a number of other countries.  Our number of cases is proportionately much lower than in other places.  Somebody told me today that Idaho in the US, which has a population of 1.5 million, is seeing 1,000 cases a day.<\/p><p>At the moment, they are seeing 1,000 cases a day, which would be the equivalent of 3,000 to 4,000 cases a day here.  We never went anywhere near that sort of number.  We are immensely proud of the ICU nurses, the doctors in emergency departments, the doctor and nurses in primary care and the people who have moved from their jobs to work in other roles as part of the response.  They have made immense contributions.  Finally, I thank the public health staff, who have been going since very early in January and are still going at this quite hard, and especially our colleagues here in Dublin, which has been the main centre of it, so it has hit hardest on people in Dublin.  We are very proud of everybody and we aim, as ever, to try and help them to work in whatever way we can.

From my reading of what the witnesses gave us, the rate of take-up in the HSE is 44%, which is far too low.

It is likely that in the long-term care facilities, the figure will be in the high 40s or around 50%.  These are significant increases from over the years.  Likewise, we know the uptake among the elderly over-65s is 68% and of people in residential care facilities it is around 90%.  The figures have been rising over a number of years.

The issue of flu immunisation among healthcare workers is a worldwide challenge.  We know that, for some reason, there have been healthcare workers who have been reluctant in the past to avail of the free flu vaccine.  I should make clear that enough vaccine has been procured and is available to immunise all our healthcare workers.  All healthcare workers receive the offer of influenza vaccine and it is offered in the workplace to facilitate their access.  It is an important part of our overall strategy for prevention of infection this winter to make sure that healthcare workers avail of the free flu vaccine.

We are actively looking at the flu season coming up and we will start vaccinating on 20 September.  I will outline two of the main drivers in increasing flu vaccine, the first of which is to increase the availability of the vaccine.  The second concerns increasing the education and communication around it.  In terms of increasing availability, we have an enormous peer vaccinator programme in the HSE, which has allowed other nurses in local areas to provide the vaccination to their peers.  This year we will include paramedics and pharmacists and we may also include some of the allied health professionals.  We will increase the number of peer vaccinators that are available on site to give the vaccine to staff in their local area.  In previous years, that has really increased the number of people who have taken up the vaccine.  In addition, we are looking to see if we can get healthcare workers vaccinated in their local GPs and pharmacies free of charge and that will hopefully be an option for us in September.  Educating healthcare workers is an ongoing thing.  We have developed HSeLanD modules and we have a number of communications.  We have a number of areas where we try to break down some of the myths about the flu vaccine and we have been working hard on that.<\/p><p>The next step is to start looking at risk-assessing front-line workers and requiring them as part of a risk assessment to partake of the vaccine.  That is something that we are exploring at the moment and it is something that has been very successful in increasing flu vaccine uptake in Australia.  We may be developing a model on that for this year because, as the committee knows, it will be critical for our healthcare workers to be vaccinated this year, especially-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#LL00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lynda Sisson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I hear everything Dr. Sisson is saying but I am not hearing enough about outcomes.

The HSE perhaps needs to consult with all of us, the Oireachtas, the Government and everybody to ensure that there is a huge campaign.  We are going to have to insist that people receive it because if people are working in a hospital environment or with older people they will place them at risk if they do not take the vaccine, notwithstanding exceptions on medical grounds.

The other thing we have noticed was the inability to practice social distancing, or a lack of awareness around it, in hospitals at the very beginning.  Some of our hospitals do not lend themselves to physical distancing.<\/p> <p>  The decision on masks was made by NPHET and we did not recommend mask-wearing at the very beginning.  However, as PPE became more available, mask-wearing was commenced.  The differences between the earliest stages and later stages were largely due to the Covid and non-Covid pathways in the hospitals, the earlier detection of cases, the implementation of social distancing and the closing of the canteens.

It may not be happening in Covid wards but it is certainly happening in the general hospitals.  It is something that needs attention paid to it.  There is also the issue of visitors transiting through the hospitals with no protection over their footwear, which is provided for in other hospitals engaged in infection prevention.

However, in the current circumstances, actually having an infection and having the symptoms of an infection should mean that people do not come in to work.

I am not differentiating between the public and healthcare workers in those circumstances - everybody should stay at home and that goes for the healthcare workers too.

We wanted to make sure that, as a consequence, PPE was available for staff who were at the highest risk of being exposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#FFF00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I have to say I am somewhat surprised when I look at the WHO guidance on wearing masks, which is, of course, that masks should be worn in a medical setting, particularly when dealing with persons with Covid-19.

Some people make out that it is clear; others do not.  I am sure that the other witnesses in the room would agree that it is important that we have a multifactorial approach to this.  Masks are not a magic bullet.  They have to be part of an overall approach, which includes social distancing.<\/p> <p>  For the public the advice is still that social distancing and respiratory and hand hygiene are the fundamentals.  That is what got us through the past four or five months.  Wearing masks adds to that, but they are not a magic bullet.  General infection prevention and control measures, specifically in healthcare settings and more generally in public settings, are very important messages.  They are the things that will keep us going.  We need to get people to remember that they still need to socially distance, have respiratory etiquette, ensure they practise hand and environmental hygiene and, as we have said, that they should self-isolate if they have symptoms.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  I am not denigrating masks.  Rather, I am saying that people should not see them as a magic bullet.  The real issue is very much that we need to keep up the other messages because the Irish people took them on board very well and that had a major impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#FFF00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Dr. Kelleher is heading up the expert advisory group on nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#FFF00700","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595286000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>No.  It is my namesake, Professor Cecily Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#FFF00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>My apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#FFF00900","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595286000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>The Chairman has the wrong sex and the wrong person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072100002#FFF01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1595286000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>My apologies.
