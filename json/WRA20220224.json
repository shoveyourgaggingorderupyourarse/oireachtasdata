This included representatives from disabled artists organisations and disabled artists. <\/p>  <p>  Following that forum, I held a public consultation throughout the month of January.  This public consultation closed three weeks ago and my Department received a significant number of submissions, reflecting the high level of interest in this new policy intervention. My officials are currently reviewing the submissions and a report on the consultation is currently being prepared which will be published in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of such a scheme on artists with disabilities is a theme that has been raised throughout the consultation and I can assure the Deputy that it is a matter I take very seriously.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the report on the Cost of Disability to which the Deputy referred and which was commissioned by my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.  The findings of the research have implications for many areas of public policy including the delivery of care services, health, housing, education, transport and income supports.  The Government has referred the report on the Cost of Disability to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group. This Steering Group is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte.  All Departments have been asked to consider actions that are currently being implementing and any proposed new actions that they will be undertaking in the context of the findings of the Report. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the issue of artists will disabilities is something which I am focused on. I believe that the Basic Income for the Arts has the potential to help artists and creative arts workers with disabilities overcome labour market barriers by creating a self-sustaining creative practice, operating on a self-employed basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 5 to 13, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Facilities","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[10151\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will consider making funding available to assist sporting bodies to improve their stadium facilities; if locations have been identified for such potential funding; the number of bodies that have contacted her seeking such funding; and the names and location of each.","asker":"1551","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[10149\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her views on the potential of Government to fund local authority-run community playing fields; if she will consider funding to purchase such land; and if her Department will fund the construction and fit-out of such facilities.","asker":"1551","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 26 together.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to my Department's responsibilities, two schemes provide grant assistance to both local authorities and sporting organisations for the development and improvement of community playing fields, sports stadia and sports facilities generally.<\/p>  <p>  The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  Inevitably, the Programme is oversubscribed however, and it does not cover the purchase of land or buildings. Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising this investment in disadvantaged areas.<\/p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the Programme closed for applications on 1 March 2021.  By this date, 3,106 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.   <\/p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The grants as announced included a significant number of allocations to local authorities for the improvement of playing pitches and to sporting organisations for improvements to their sports grounds. Details of all applications submitted under the 2020 round can be viewed on www.gov.ie. All valid capital applications received a grant offer and all allocations can also be viewed on a county basis on the same site.   <\/p>  <p>  All unsuccessful applicants will be able to appeal the Department's decision. When the appeals process is complete, a full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and any recommendations contained therein will be factored in to the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of the next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete. <\/p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department to Local Authorities and sporting organisations for the development and improvement of community playing fields, sports stadia and sports facilities under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The LSSIF is designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  Details of all grants, including those related to stadium improvements,  are published on the Gov.ie website. While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects, as it is now two years since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department has now met with all successful grantees and work is at an advanced stage in drafting the review. I expect this work to be finalised shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Once that review is complete the scope for awarding any additional LSSIF grants, adjusting the level  of existing grants and the timing of any new call for proposals under the LSSIF will be considered.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to contacts by sporting organisations, as the Deputy will be aware, the SCEP and the LSSIF are important to numerous communities and sports organisations throughout the country and I receive regular representations on both. I am always willing to engage with interested parties on the programmes given their huge benefits for so many people, communities and clubs. The recent record package of &euro;150 million in new capital grants under the SCEP (when account is taken of the &euro;6 million kept in reserve to deal with the appeals process) reflects the government&rsquo;s ongoing support to sport as the sector emerges from the challenges of the past two years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[10472\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n leagan amach at&aacute; i gceist maidir leis an dul i gcomhairle maidir le h&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus strucht&uacute;r an Bhoird; c&eacute;n uair at&aacute; s&uacute;il aige a bheith in ann cinnt&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh faoin gceist seo; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1575","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Mar is eol don Teachta, luaitear sa Chl&aacute;r Rialtais go nd&eacute;anfar athbhreithni&uacute; ar strucht&uacute;ir fheidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus rialachais &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, agus ar an bpr&oacute;iseas roghn&uacute;ch&aacute;in\/toghach&aacute;in i nd&aacute;il le Bord an &Uacute;dar&aacute;is.<\/p>  <p>  Mar a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an athbhreithni&uacute; ar an bpr&oacute;iseas roghn&uacute;ch&aacute;in\/toghch&aacute;in i nd&aacute;il le bord an &Uacute;dar&aacute;is, cuireadh t&uacute;s le gairid le comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n poibl&iacute; mar chuid den athbhreithni&uacute;. <\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh sa chaoi is go mbeidh an deis chu&iacute; ag p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara agus ag an bpobal tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile a dtuairim&iacute; faoin &aacute;bhar a roinnt i scr&iacute;bhinn leis an Roinn.

Following that forum I held a public consultation throughout the month of January. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the consultation was to ensure that the general public, artists, and those working in the arts and culture sector have the opportunity to contribute to policy development for the pilot scheme and to offer suggestions from their experiences as artists, arts workers, and members of resource organisations on key issues such as the schemes objectives, eligibility criteria, supporting emerging artists and participant responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  The public consultation closed three weeks ago and my Department received a significant number of submissions, reflecting the high level of interest in this new policy intervention. Officials in my Department are currently reviewing the submissions and a report on the consultation is currently being prepared which will be published  shortly. <\/p>  <p>  I am at present giving consideration to the feedback of the sector received through the consultation as I finalise the eligibility criteria for the pilot scheme.  Such a significant policy intervention takes time to operationalise and final details of the selection process, number of participants, eligibility criteria, rate of payment etc. are being reviewed following the consultation. However, the following broad parameters have been agreed:<\/p>  <p>  - Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test.<\/p>  <p>  - It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process.<\/p>  <p>  - A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post appraisal of the pilot in due course.<\/p>  <p>  I have always stated that my ambition is to open the scheme for applications in the first quarter of 2022 and that remains the case.  My Department is currently finalising the scheme taking on board the feedback from the consultation and I expect to make an announcement in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  As this is a pilot scheme with the intention of researching what the impact of a basic income style support would have on the arts sector, it would not be appropriate to extend it to everyone in the sector at pilot stage.  The three year research programme will collect data to provide the evidence base regarding impact.  A decision based on the outcome of the research would then need to be taken by Government as to if the scheme were to become a permanent intervention and if it would be extended to all eligible artists and creative arts workers. <\/p>  <p>  The Basic Income for the Arts pilot is a key priority of mine.  I believe the pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA05000"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[10338\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400058#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if the large-scale sports infrastructure fund is due to reopen for applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>The Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects, including swimming pools, with at least &euro;100m being made available over the period to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and, thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.

Central to the pursuit of that objective is the application of a Sport for All approach that is aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.\u00a0<\/p><p>At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023 and this includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.\u00a0<\/p><p>That plan contains a specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. It further commits that this fund will apply the Sport for All ethos.Work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in funding drawn down from the Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated from the Dormant Accounts funding for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition to this over-arching emphasis on the Sport for All approach, the Sports Action Plan also provides for an annual Winter Initiative, which is a rolling programme of activities and initiatives that aims to get people back to sport and increase participation in the aftermath of COVID-19. The programme has run successfully over the past few months, with a wide range of activities taking place throughout the sports sector and includes measures to boost participation levels among persons with disabilities. The Winter Initiative programme\u00a0has provided National Governing Bodies of Sport with a perfect platform to launch their Autumn and Winter Programmes and will continue up to the end of March.<\/p><p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that at the last count there were over 700 events occurring under the Winter Initiative. 66 National Governing Bodies of Sport are participating, as are all 29 Local Sports Partnerships. Details on the events that are taking place can be found on the website of Sport Ireland, and through the respective organisations running the events.\u00a0It is my intention that a similar programme will be run next Winter and to that end my Department and Sport Ireland will commence planning in that regard in the coming months.<\/p><p>I would also like to emphasise the important contribution that Sport Ireland makes in this area. Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.\u00a0<\/p><p>In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its\u00a0<i>Participation Plan 2021-2024<\/i>&ndash;\u00a0Increasing Participation in Changing Ireland. The Participation Plan outlines how Sport Ireland will continue to help people get active by removing barriers to participation in sport and physical activity in the coming years. The Sport Ireland Participation Plan actions will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies, strategic partners, clubs, communities and individuals.<\/p><p>The Sport Ireland Participation Plan is built on, and guided by, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 (NSP) and the Sport Ireland Strategy 2018-2022. The Participation Plan takes into consideration Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013&ndash;2025 and the National Physical Activity Plan as well as global and national developments.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a specific Diversity and Inclusion policy which is expected to be launched in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400059#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equality Issues","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400059#WRB01200"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[10433\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400059#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of meeting the target of 40% female representation on the boards of sporting organisations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>Addressing women&rsquo;s participation at all levels in sport is an important element of the National Sports Policy.

The Code of Programme Standards developed by the BAI pursuant to section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out that broadcasters should exercise due care in broadcasting depictions and\/or descriptions of violence in programme material. The Code also sets out that broadcasters shall have due regard to the appropriateness of and\/or justification for the inclusion of violent content in programme material. <\/p><p>In regard to the portrayal of violence through social media and audiovisual-on-demand media services, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 will establish Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n as a multi-person Media Commission to include an Online Safety Commissioner. It will dissolve the BAI, establish regulatory frameworks for online safety and the regulation of audiovisual media services, and transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive.<\/p><p>The Bill will also amend and extend the duties, codes and rules currently applicable to broadcasters under the Broadcasting Act 2009 to audiovisual-on-demand media services. Accordingly, the Bill will empower Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n to make codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by both broadcasters and audiovisual-on-demand media services. Under the Bill, An Coimisi&uacute;n may, in particular, make codes to ensure that programme material relating to gratuitous violence or sexual conduct is presented with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience and in such a way that children will not normally hear or see anything which may impair their physical, mental or moral development.<\/p><p>It will be the role of the Online Safety Commissioner to oversee the regulatory framework for online safety. As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how designated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. <\/p><p>  Among other categories of content, online safety codes will ensure that designated online services take appropriate measures to reduce the availability of offence-specific online content and cyber-bullying material on their services. The full list of offence-specific online content is set out in section 45 of the Bill and includes, for example, relevant offences under Coco&rsquo;s Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020. In the case of Coco's Law, it is intended that this will have the effect of reducing the availability, on designated online services, of intimate images which have been shared without consent and of threatening or grossly offensive communications about, or to, another person.<\/p><p>In addition to instances of cyber-bullying which would be considered as offence-specific harmful online content, the online safety codes will also address serious cyber-bullying material which is not related to a criminal offence. In contrast to the category relating to offence-specific online content, the non offence-specific categories of content will be subject to a risk of harm test. Accordingly, such content will only be considered harmful online content under the Bill where it gives rise to any risk to a person&rsquo;s life, or a risk of significant harm to a person&rsquo;s physical or mental health. <\/p><p>Under the Bill, in the event of a failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover.<\/p><p>  Finally, the Bill will also allow the An Coimisi&uacute;n to create non-binding guidance materials for providers of relevant online services. Such guidance materials may seek to protect children in particular, but also the general public, from harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content. The Bill provides for a definition of age-inappropriate online content which includes, in particular, content which consists of realistic representations of gross or gratuitous violence or acts of cruelty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400059#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":87,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 27.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Policy","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400059#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[10505\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400059#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans for international tourism for 2022; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the tourism sector has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic so I was pleased to secure a record level of funding for tourism in Budget 2022 of &euro;288.5 million in total, an increase of &euro;67.5 million over the 2021 allocation.

Our overall vision for women in sport is one where women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport. <\/p>  <p>  A fundamental aim of the Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to increase the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population, with a specific focus on less represented groups including women and girls.  A lot of good progress is being made, not just in terms of increasing participation by women and girls but also in the important areas of leadership and management roles in sport. <\/p>  <p>  The Women in Sport funding programme is an important support for sporting bodies in putting programmes in place to increase women&rsquo;s participation in their sports and to progress their strategic objectives for women in sport. Last year, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;4m in the Women in Sport Programme for the two years 2021 and 2022.  45 NGBs will receive funding under this investment.  A further &euro;265,000 was invested last year in the Local Sports Partnerships under the Programme. <\/p>  <p>  One of my priorities in 2021 was to eliminate the funding gap that existed in grant funding for male and female Gaelic players and I am very pleased to have achieved that aim and ensured that we have now parity in terms of that grant funding. Additional funding has been provided for enhanced support of female inter-county Gaelic games players on an equivalent basis to that being provided for their male counterparts. This additional provision brings the total amount available for female players in this context to &euro;2.4m. This is a very important development for women&rsquo;s sport and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to equality in sport.  <\/p>  <p>  The aim in the National Sport Policy 2018-2027 is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport entirely by 2027. The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor Report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years.<\/p>  <p>  While the Irish Sports Monitor report for the first quarter of 2021 showed that the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest Irish Sports Monitor figures for Quarter 3 show that a gender gap is beginning to re-emerge as COVID 19 restrictions are lifted.  The emerging gradient is cause for focus and ongoing monitoring. To this end, many National Governing Bodies are delivering Women in Sport and Dormant Accounts Funded Programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing women&rsquo;s participation at all levels in sport is an important element of the National Sports Policy. That includes women in leadership positions such as board members of National Governing Bodies. The National Sports Policy had originally set a target of 30% of either gender on the Boards of funded bodies by 2027.  In the new Action Plan for Sport 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, we have set a revised target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023.  It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation.<\/p>  <p>  While there has been good progress for women in sport, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. My officials and I continue to work closely with Sport Ireland and the sport sector with a view to achieving a much improved landscape for women and girls in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400059#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400060#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[10473\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400060#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n uair a thagann deireadh le tr&eacute;imhse na gcomhalta&iacute; de Bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair; an bhfuil s&eacute; d&oacute;chasach go mbeidh struct&uacute;ir nua boird i bhfeidhm roimh an d&aacute;ta sin; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1575","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>Mar is eol don Teachta, faoi r&eacute;ir na bhfor&aacute;lacha &aacute;bhartha de na hAchtanna um &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, arna leas&uacute; faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, is ar feadh tr&eacute;imhse c&uacute;ig bliana a mhaireann ceapach&aacute;in  ar bhord an &Uacute;dar&aacute;is, c&eacute; is m&oacute;ite de na comhalta&iacute; at&aacute; ainmnithe ag na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la a bhfuil ceantar beag Gaeltachta i gceist, eadhon: Contaetha Chorca&iacute;, Phort L&aacute;irge agus na M&iacute;.

In the pursuit of that objective, we are committed to a Sport for All approach aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023, which includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.<\/p>  <p>  That plan contains a specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. It further commits that this fund will apply the Sport for All ethos.  Work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in funding drawn down from the Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated from the Dormant Accounts funding for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a specific Diversity and Inclusion policy which is expected to be launched shortly. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to participation in sport by women and girls, the aim in the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport entirely by 2027.

This represents an additional &euro;800,000 over the 2021 allocation. <\/p>  <p>  Language plans in respect of four Gaeltacht Service Towns - Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, Letterkenny, Galway City and An Cloch&aacute;n Liath - have been approved to date while language plans in respect of the towns of Tralee and Dungarvan are currently being evaluated by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The process of preparing language plans is underway for the following towns - Cahersiveen, Cork City, Castlebar, Clifden and Ballinrobe, while the preparation of plans has yet to begin in respect of Donegal Town, B&eacute;al an Mhuirthead, Macroom, Athboy and Navan.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, language plans in respect of three Irish Language Networks have been approved under the language planning process, namely, Ennis, Clondalkin and Loughrea. Foras na Gaeilge has also approved two Irish Language Networks north of the border which, although falling outside the scope of the Act, form an integral part of the language planning process. <\/p>  <p>  A broader overview of the advances being made in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions - including the language planning process, is set out in the second progress report on the ongoing implementation of the Government's 5-year Action Plan for the Irish Language which my Department published on behalf of Government in October 2021. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400060#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Plean&aacute;il Teanga","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400060#WRC01200"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[10319\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400060#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"maidir le Ceist Pharlaiminteach Uimhir 136 an 20 Ean&aacute;ir 2022, an dtabharfaidh s&iacute; soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar st&aacute;das phlean teanga Oile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1577","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>Maidir le plean teanga na n-Oile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann, mar a luaigh m&eacute; sa fhreagra a thug m&eacute; ar Cheist D&aacute;la uimhir 136 ar an 20&uacute; Ean&aacute;ir 2022, bh&iacute; deis agam roimh an Nollaig casadh le hionadaithe &oacute; na hOile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann at&aacute; gn&iacute;omhach sa phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga chun a bplean a phl&eacute;.

In total, almost 301,000 premises in the Intervention Area across all counties have been surveyed, with over 157,000 premises constructed or under construction across 26 counties and almost 34,500 premises are now passed with high speed fibre broadband.In line with a remedial plan to address Covid-19 related delays which was agreed with the Department in April 2021, NBI had expected to have almost 60,000 premises passed and available for immediate connection by the end of\u00a0January 2022. As would be expected with a large scale infrastructure build of this nature, challenges were encountered within planning and build processes and also as a result of Covid-19 impacts. NBI actively continues to work with its network and build partners to address any\u00a0issues as they arise. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. The focus for 2022 is to continue to build momentum in the build, catch up on the delays experienced and plan for acceleration.

The contract with NBI contains a comprehensive set of protections and legally binding obligations.

The Centre has contingency plans in place in case of an increase in tensions, and is engaging bilaterally with key infrastructure operators across Government and the private sector. The NCSC has also issued a number of guidance and support documents recently, including a &lsquo;Cyber Vitals&rsquo; Check list on 1 February, and a detailed Advisory Note on 17 February.

NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p>  <p>  It remains the ambition of the Government to rollout the National Broadband Plan as quickly as possible. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.<\/p>  <p>  The NBP Contract allows National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to explore alternative technologies if they are deemed necessary to assist delivery of the contract requirements. In doing so NBI must ensure that any alternative technologies utilised do not negatively impact on having a reliable and robust network available for all premises within the Intervention Area and that minimum contracted speeds are achieved. These considerations are a matter for NBI in the first instance given its responsibility to deliver the State led intervention under the contract with the State.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 11 February 2022, 486 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base of 3,799 at the end of 2017, to over 50,500 now. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has introduced its objective to be a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050 in a robust fashion through primary legislation. The commitment has been placed on a statutory footing through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. Core Measures will focus on a shift to transport modes with lower energy consumption, including walking, cycling, and public transport; accelerating the electrification of road transport; and the use of biofuels. Examples of key initiatives include a requirement, from 2023, that all new vehicles being purchased by the State are BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles), unless there is no viable electric option. <\/p>  <p>  Modelling for the Climate Action Plan included electrification of the Irish fleet. A number of scenarios were modelled based on all future vehicle sales becoming 100% electric by a given year. The core scenario assumes plug-in electric vehicles rising to 100% of new private car sales (80% battery electric vehicles and 20% plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) by 2029. This uptake profile delivers around 845,000 plug-in electric private cars &lsquo;on the road&rsquo; in 2030. The private car fleet emission model suggests that this rate of uptake of electric vehicles will deliver a 36% reduction in tail-pipe carbon emissions per car Km. The overall impact of improved vehicle technology, including electrification, is a 4.0Mt (=29%) reduction in total transport-related carbon emissions by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400068#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":521,"content":"<p>Question No. 209 answered with Question No. 208.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":523,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[10544\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400068#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the ESB ecar cards require a minimum credit of &euro;5 at all times; the rationale for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":524,"content":"<p>The ESB eCars charging network was free to use from 2010 until 2019.

The driver shortage is not confined to Ireland; it has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for a number of years now.  It is a multifaceted issue with a range of different contributing factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on the labour market for many sectors.<\/p><p>My Department established the National Logistics and Supply Chain<b><\/b>Skills Group in 2019, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sectors in Ireland.  The Group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education and training providers and all of the relevant Government Departments and Agencies. <\/p><p>Last year I asked the Group to examine the HGV driver shortage and make recommendations, with specific regard to actions that can be taken by Government and the industry. These recommendations were finalised at the end of 2021 and have been published here - gov.ie - Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group (www.gov.ie) The recommendations are aimed at ameliorating the supply issue, without undermining the working conditions and health and safety of drivers or other road users.  <\/p><p>Implementation of the Recommendations will now be monitored via the Logistics and Supply Chain<b><\/b>Skills Group who meet quarterly. Some of the recommendations have already been implemented and work is ongoing in respect of others.<\/p><p>For example, recruitment from abroad could make new drivers available in the short term. My Department maintains regular engagement with the Department of Social Protection (DSP), which has dedicated employer relations teams offering a range of supports and services to employers to fill vacancies including recruitment campaigns, specialised jobs fairs and through the online portal JobsIreland.ie.<\/p><p>The DSP organises events in the EU\/EEA labour market via the EURES network. On 02 March next there will be a EURES event aimed at jobseekers based in Romania who are interested in coming to Ireland to work. On 15 March, there will be an event for jobseekers from across the EU with a focus specifically on jobs in Ireland in the transport sector, as well as in hospitality and construction. Companies can post job vacancies directly on the event website here - Jobs in Ireland 2022 &ndash; Hospitality, Construction &amp;amp; Transport | EURES - European Job Days &ndash; and I understand that many companies in the transport sector have already done so.<\/p><p>HGV drivers from outside the EU\/EEA must have a valid employment permit and a visa to work in Ireland, if coming from a visa required state as defined by the Department of Justice.  Following engagement with my colleague Minister of State English at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU\/EEA was removed in 2021. I am aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently experiencing a high level of applications for work permits across all sectors but has recently assigned additional resources to work through this. Non EU\/EEA drivers must also exchange their HGV drivers licence for an Irish licence.  Ireland has licence exchange agreements with several countries and the Road Safety Authority, which oversees these agreements, is engaging with a number of other countries with a view to progressing further licence exchange agreements.<\/p><p>In terms of attracting young people already based in Ireland into transport careers, the promotion of education, training, careers and sustainable employment in the sector is crucial, along with skills development and career progression for existing workers. I am very encouraged at recent new programmes such as the BSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management and the Logistics Associate Apprenticeship involving TU Dublin and Munster Technological University and, in development, the first ever Commercial Driver Apprenticeship programme at Sligo IT.<\/p><p>The Logistics and Supply Chains Skills Group has recently published a comprehensive <i>Overview of the  Existing Education and Training Provision in Logistics and Supply Chain<\/i>. In addition, the group has prepared 2 general information notes on <i>How to qualify as a HGV driver in Ireland<\/i>and <i>Requirements for recruitment of HGV Drivers who are non-EEA citizens<\/i>, to assist individuals in understanding what is involved in becoming a HGV driver and companies in recruiting new talent. These notes are all available on the LSCSG webpage at the link provided above.<\/p><p>Regarding HGV driver testing in Ireland, in the 4 weeks prior to 20 February, an average of 211 tests for HGV drivers were carried out by RSA testers each week, with a pass rate of 78%. This means that 164 HGV drivers were qualified on average each week.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a 10-year strategy for the haulage sector. The Government&rsquo;s aim is to develop a strategy that will focus on generating efficiencies and improving standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.  A section of the Strategy will focus on the driver and skills shortage &ndash; highlighting work underway and ensuring a focus remains on this issue. Work on the strategy is ongoing with a plan for further consultation with the public and stakeholders in the coming months.<\/p><p>I will continue to proactively engage with the freight transport, distribution and logistics sectors and the Government is committed to continuing to support the industry. It is vitally important for education, industry, and government to work together to enhance the appeal of a career in road haulage and logistics, so that the sector can both attract and retain talent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenways Provision","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM01200"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[10684\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an update on the progress of each section of the Royal Canal greenway from Maynooth to Ashtown, Dublin 15; the costs granted to each section to date; and if his attention has been drawn to the Clonsilla to Castleknock section in the context of design and planning issues.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>As Minister, I have responsibility for the policy and overall funding in relation to Active Travel.

In addition, my Department facilitates, through an EIB-Ireland Financing Group and relevant sub-groups, engagement between the EIB and interested parties, including other Departments and State Bodies, in relation to these priorities.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the EIB has provided in the region of EUR 1billion in financial support to Irish projects in recent years.   Much of the information which the Deputy is seeking is published on the EIB&rsquo;s website (www.eib.org\/en\/projects\/index.htm).   I understand that elements of the request, including the repayment schedule, and interest rate are commercially sensitive and not available.  In 2021 alone, the Deputy will note that Irish projects listed there received EIB funding in excess of EUR 600 million directly from the EIB.  This included EUR 65 million loan for a windfarm in County Mayo; EUR 170 million to support deployment of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) fixed very high capacity (VHC) network throughout Ireland, and; EUR 200 million to the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) for a social and affordable housing programme for the next four years.  It should also be noted that in 2021 Ireland also benefited from a number of other investments, supported by the European Guarantee Fund (EGF), a crisis support instrument, established by the EIB Group in response to the Covid-19 crisis to support SMEs and Midcaps.<\/p>  <p>  While I am not in a position to disclose ongoing negotiations between the EIB and other Government departments or State bodies, I would note that the EIB has been providing significant support to housing development in Ireland including the EUR 200 million loan I mentioned previously, which was signed at the end of last year.  This is in addition to other loans provided for social and affordable housing in 2019, one of which was EUR 200 million to the HFA, and another of which was to the NTMA of EUR 61 million for a PPP Social Housing Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the State also supports housing development funding through a number of different State agencies, including: Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI); Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF); Land Development Agency (LDA); Housing Finance Agency (HFA); National Asset Management Agency (NTMA).  Each of these State bodies has a mandate to support the funding and development of residential housing.  The Housing Finance Agency&rsquo;s borrowing from EIB for the purpose of supporting social and affordable housing in Ireland referenced above forms part of Government&rsquo;s housing policy which is overseen by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM03300"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[10539\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications for the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, from its inception to date; the number of applications that have been refused during the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the scheme commenced, 51,988 employers have registered and payroll submissions have been filed in respect of 727,662 eligible employees.  Subsidy payments totalling &euro;6.5 billion and PRSI credits totalling  &euro;1 billion have been processed to date.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is currently open to employers who file their payroll submissions electronically through Revenue Online Service (ROS) and who were registered at, and had correctly received a valid subsidy by 31 December 2021, or who re-entered the scheme from 1 January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of the EWSS is placed under the care and management of Revenue.  From the commencement of the scheme up to 31 December 2021, employers had the facility to register themselves for the scheme online using ROS.  There was no &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; stage in the process for employers registering online up to this date.  As the scheme was operated on a &ldquo;self-assessment&rdquo; basis, with employers signing a declaration stating that their business qualified for the scheme, proof of eligibility for the scheme was not requested at registration stage.  In signing the declaration, employers agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of the scheme and undertook to retain all records relating to the scheme, including the basis of eligibility, for review by Revenue at a later stage. For July to December 2021, employers provided to Revenue details of their eligibility reviews on a monthly ERF (Eligibility Review Form) filed through ROS. Subsidy payments were held and not paid to those employers who breached the 30% threshold test or did not file an ERF within prescribed timelines for pay dates after 1 July. As at 21 February 2022, &euro;63.8m is being held by Revenue for threshold breaches or non-filing of the ERF record. <\/p>  <p>  On 21 December 2021, in light of public health restrictions announced on 17 December 2021, I announced a re-opening of the scheme for certain employers who would otherwise be ineligible. These were employers who were previously eligible for EWSS but were not eligible on 31 December 2021.  Under these measures, employers who met specific eligibility criteria were afforded an opportunity to apply for re-entry to the EWSS with effect from 1 January 2022.  Revenue received 466 applications for re-entry to the EWSS with effect from 1 January 2022 and 9 re-entry applications have been refused to date.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue undertakes a multi-faceted risk-based approach to compliance checks to safeguard the integrity of the EWSS. This includes real time checking of submissions and cross-referencing claim data against other Revenue data sources to identify anomalies or trends requiring attention. Overall, Revenue has finalised EWSS related interventions with 4,081 employers, recouping &euro;24.3 million, which equates to 0.37% of the total subsidy paid. There are further compliance checks with 2,215 employers ongoing, which will be finalised by Revenue in due course. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM03600"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[10576\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400069#WRM03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of engagements, including online meetings, webinars, briefings and in-person meetings he or officials from his Department have had with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland from 1 January 2019 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>During the period mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question I have engaged with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland (NWCI) on six occasions including in the context of the annual National Economic Dialogue and Pre-Budget meetings with the Community and Voluntary Pillar of which the NWCI is a member organisation.

Many of these strategies include priorities that seek to enhance access, participation and engagement with culture and creativity. This funding provided to local authorities can result in the organisation of music-based creative projects such as <i>Making Music with Sonamus, <\/i>a tuition programme by Wicklow County Council in partnership with Music Network offering participants over 55 an opportunity to experience and learn an array of musical styles and techniques from the combined musical backgrounds of Sonamus members<\/p><p>The Department also provides funding to support Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;), which is the largest group involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music both at community and national level.

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion.   The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritise the investment in disadvantaged areas.<\/p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the Programme closed for applications on 1 March 2021.  By this date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. The priority in the medium term is to progress all of these projects to grant drawdown stage.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to any unsuccessful applications, my Department will be in touch with relevant applicants shortly outlining the procedures which need to be followed to appeal the Department's decision. When the appeals process is complete, a full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and any recommendations contained therein will be included in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for sports facilities under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The LSSIF is designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also provides capital support for the construction of swimming pools.  In this regard, the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP) provides grant aid towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. To date 52 pools have been completed and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme. Lucan pool is under construction and is expected to be completed later this year, while both the Buncrana and Edenderry projects are at Contract Documents stage.<\/p>  <p>  Exchequer support for any new swimming pool projects is now being provided under the LSSIF.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the ongoing support through capital grants for sporting infrastructure, on 13 December 2021, Minister Martin and I announced the allocation of almost &euro;80m for the sport sector under two separate support programmes.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;73.6 million was provided in Covid-19 funding under five separate streams to help sports organisations to recover and grow post-pandemic, support our grassroots networks of clubs and local sports partnerships, and ensure that people of all ages and abilities return to sport and physical activity.  A further &euro;5.3 million was allocated to National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Sports Partnerships for the provision of sports equipment including the roll out of defibrillators for clubs, sport kits for school children and state of the art equipment for our high performance athletes.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, the Government announced over &euro;181 million in funding for sport this year, an increase of almost &euro;11 million compared to the 2021 Revised Estimate. The current expenditure budget for Sport Ireland this year is &euro;96 million, an increase of over &euro;4 million from 2021. This funding will enable Sport Ireland to continue to support the sport sector as it recovers from the challenges of Covid and will allow continued grant funding support for sporting bodies through Sport Ireland's range of funding programmes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"question","counter":648,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[10754\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she and her Department continue to encourage participation in sports in 2022 with particular reference to the necessity to encourage wider participation in the aftermath of Covid-19; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[10755\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she proposes to encourage sporting and recreation activities at local level in 2022; the ongoing expenditure in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Winter Initiative is a rolling programme of activities and initiatives that aims to get people back to sport and increase participation in the aftermath of COVID-19.

In addition to their immense inherent value, these are valued by all of our communities as important resources for social cohesion, individual and community wellbeing and for the presentation of Ireland as an attractive destination for tourism and sustainable inward investment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the core Departmental goals set out in this document, a number of cross cutting-goals have been incorporated into the Department&rsquo;s objectives which will be reflected in our policies and programmes over the lifetime of this Statement of Strategy including supporting and promoting diversity, social inclusion and full and effective female participation across the Department&rsquo;s sectors and society in line with Programme for Government commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":666,"content":"<p>Question No. 257 answered with Question No. 256.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":667,"content":"<p>Question No. 258 answered with Question No. 256.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadcasting Sector","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO03200"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[10762\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she and her Department are likely to monitor developments in the media with particular reference to addressing the proliferation of channels involved in promoting physical, mental or sexual violence against those who are deemed to be weaker or in their power; her views on whether the time has come to impose sanctions on such channels; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[10764\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO03400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she expects to challenge media outlets involved in the glorification of violence against women, children or others deemed to be weaker; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":671,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 260 together.<\/p><p>In regard to the portrayal of violence that may be broadcast in Ireland, under section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), as an independent regulator, is required to make codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by broadcasters. The Code of Programme Standards developed by the BAI pursuant to section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out that broadcasters should exercise due care in broadcasting depictions and\/or descriptions of violence in programme material. The Code also sets out that broadcasters shall have due regard to the appropriateness of and\/or justification for the inclusion of violent content in programme material.<\/p><p>In regard to the portrayal of violence through social media and audiovisual-on-demand media services, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 will establish Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n as a multi-person Media Commission to include an Online Safety Commissioner. It will dissolve the BAI, establish regulatory frameworks for online safety and the regulation of audiovisual media services, and transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive.<\/p><p>The Bill will amend and extend the duties, codes and rules currently applicable to broadcasters under the Broadcasting Act 2009 to audiovisual-on-demand media services. Accordingly, the Bill will empower Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n to make codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by both broadcasters and audiovisual-on-demand media services. Under the Bill, An Coimisi&uacute;n may, in particular, make codes to ensure that programme material relating to gratuitous violence or sexual conduct is presented with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience and in such a way that children will not normally hear or see anything which may impair their physical, mental or moral development.<\/p><p>As regards content on other categories of online services, it will be the role of the Online Safety Commissioner to oversee the regulatory framework for online safety. As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how designated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms.<\/p><p>Among other categories of content, online safety codes will ensure that designated online services take appropriate measures to reduce the availability of offence-specific online content and cyber-bullying material on their services. The full list of offence-specific online content is set out in section 45 of the Bill and includes, for example, relevant offences under Coco&rsquo;s Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020. In the case of Coco's Law, it is intended that this will have the effect of reducing the availability, on designated online services, of intimate images which have been shared without consent and of threatening or grossly offensive communications about, or to, another person.<\/p><p>  In addition to instances of cyber-bullying which would be considered as offence-specific harmful online content, the online safety codes will also address serious cyber-bullying material which is not related to a criminal offence. In contrast to the category relating to offence-specific online content, the non offence-specific categories of content will be subject to a risk of harm test. Accordingly, such content will only be considered harmful online content under the Bill where it gives rise to any risk to a person&rsquo;s life, or a risk of significant harm to a person&rsquo;s physical or mental health.<\/p><p>Under the Bill, in the event of a failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, An Coimisi&uacute;n will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover.<\/p><p>Finally, the Bill will also allow An Coimisi&uacute;n to create non-binding guidance materials for providers of relevant online services. Such guidance materials may seek to protect children in particular, but also the general public, from harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content. The Bill provides for a definition of age-inappropriate online content which includes, in particular, content which consists of realistic representations of gross or gratuitous violence or acts of cruelty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":672,"content":"<p>Question No. 260 answered with Question No. 259.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gaeltacht Policy","counter":673,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO03700"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[10765\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO03800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she and her Department continue to promote Irish language and culture in Gaeltacht areas throughout the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":675,"content":"<p>The 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and the accompanying Action Plan for the Irish Language (Plean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta 2018-2022) represents state policy for the Irish language and Gaeltacht regions.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy and Action Plan have cross-departmental ownership and, accordingly, responsibility for implementation falls on a number of Government Departments, bodies and Irish language and Gaeltacht organisations. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media is responsible for coordinating its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan and the second annual progress report published in October 2021 -  covering the 18 month period from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2020, present a clear overview of the 180 or so actions being advanced by c. 60 stakeholders in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions.<\/p>  <p>  A copy of the Action Plan, together with the progress report, can be found on the Department's website. The actions set out in the plan are presented around the nine specific areas of action as set out in the overarching strategy. Of particular interest to the Deputy will be Area of Action 2: An Ghaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  I might also point out that an additional exchequer allocation of &euro;7m has been provided in Budget 2022 for the Irish language and Gaeltacht sectors, ultimately meaning that total funding in excess of &euro;85m is being deployed in support of the Irish language via my Department alone next year.<\/p>  <p>  A budget allocation of &euro;5.8m is being made available in 2022 to support the Language Planning Process.  This will enable my Department to fund both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge who are tasked under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 with supporting the language planning process.  It will also enable my Department to support, at a central level, organisations which operate in the Early Years and Childhood, Family and Traditional Arts sectors as an additional support to the language planning process.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides significant co-funding to Foras na Gaeilge to carry out its statutory mandate under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis. This funding, along with funding from the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, enables Foras na Gaeilge to provide support, advice and financial assistance to many community language groups and to its six lead organisations who are working to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 has recently been signed into law.  The primary purpose of the Act is to amend the Official Languages Act 2003 with a view to increasing and improving the provision of public services through the Irish language. The systematic implementation of the Act will serve to further indirectly benefit the language in Gaeltacht regions.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that these key measures will continue to support and develop greater use of the Irish language both within Gaeltacht regions and nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[10766\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO04100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which she continues to ensure the availability of opportunities in arts and culture throughout the Gaeltacht area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":678,"content":"<p>Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta Teo., a joint venture between &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Arts Council, is the organisation responsible for promoting the development of the contemporary and the traditional arts in the Gaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  It is against the backdrop of the relevant measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for the Irish language 2018-2022 that Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta operate.

A breakdown of my Department&rsquo;s additional funding is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;1.275m was sanctioned by my Department in 2019 in order to support language-based arts classes and development opportunities in the various Language Planning Areas throughout the Gaeltacht over a three year period.  In the context of this programme, I also allocated a further &euro;50,000 recently to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta which will focus on promoting opportunities for young people taking part in the language-based arts classes to showcase their artistic talents outside the classroom environment.<\/p>  <p>  - As a separate initiative, I sanctioned an additional &euro;150,000 on a pilot basis to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta in 2021 enabling them to develop a drama programme directed at the youth in Gaeltacht areas.  This entails 700 hours of drama classes benefiting up to 230 pupils.  It also enables the organisation to conduct research and explore the activities and resources currently available to young people in the Gaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  - This funding also enables Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta to employ an additional five co-ordinators to implement the programme (four full-time and one part-time) located in the various Gaeltacht regions.<\/p>  <p>  I might also point out that further funding of &euro;12,200 per annum was allocated to Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne to provide language-based arts classes in the West Kerry Gaeltacht, while many of the national initiatives funded under the Creative Ireland Programme are also available in the Gaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  My officials continue to engage with relevant stakeholders including Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta in order to explore any opportunity arising for the artistic community, to build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector at present and to implement appropriate solutions for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400071#WRO04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400072#WRP00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Accommodation","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400072#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[10545\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400072#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a building (details supplied) is homeless accommodation or a domestic violence shelter.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":682,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.

This new regime will be administered in due course by the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA), and by An Bord Plean&aacute;la (ABP) and the coastal local authorities.<\/p><p>This new marine planning system will replace existing State and development consent regimes (<i>i.e. <\/i>the existing foreshore system with the exception of the responsibilities of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine) and will streamline arrangements on the basis of a single consent principle, <i>i.e. <\/i>one state consent (Maritime Area Consent) to enable occupation of the Maritime Area and one development consent (planning permission), with a single environmental assessment.<\/p><p>Maritime Area Consents (MACs) will be granted by MARA. Development consent responsibility for coastal areas will be generally discharged by the relevant local authority within a newly designated nearshore area i.e. from the high water mark 3nm seaward. ABP will be responsible for certain classes of development within the entire Maritime Area and for the generality of development beyond the nearshore.<\/p><p>The MAP Act also sets out special provisions for offshore renewable energy (ORE) projects satisfying the definition of &ldquo;relevant maritime usage&rdquo;. Recognising that it will take time to establish a new agency, it was decided by Government that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications should be granted limited powers to invite MAC applications for ORE projects satisfying the definition of &ldquo;relevant maritime usage&rdquo; for a specified period in advance of the establishment of MARA. A public consultation on these processes was held recently by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and applications for MACs from these projects will be accepted later this year. Any project satisfying the definition of &ldquo;relevant maritime usage&rdquo; which is granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new regime. <\/p><p>The aim is to have MARA established by Q1 2023 and, to facilitate this, a dedicated Unit has been set up within my Department to progress the Implementation Plan to establish this new agency. Extensive preparatory work will be required over the coming months to enable MARA to undertake the wide range of its statutory functions post-establishment. This work includes drafting commencement orders, and preparing a series of regulations and statutory guidelines as well as developing the processes dependent on same.  <\/p><p>In the interim period, responsibility for development on Ireland&rsquo;s foreshore will continue to be regulated under the provisions of the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended. As Minister, I am the &lsquo;appropriate Minister&rsquo; for the purposes of this Act (with the exception of a number of specific areas of responsibility for which the Minister for Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine is the appropriate Minister), and I will continue to accept, assess and grant\/refuse applications for foreshore leases and licences under the foreshore regime until MARA is established. After the establishment of MARA, new applications will not be accepted under the current Foreshore consenting regime, but applications on hand (e.g. site investigation applications etc.) will be processed to completion.<\/p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number and complexity of foreshore licence and lease applications over the last two to three years. The majority of this increased activity is related to Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) infrastructural development, including potential development site investigation activity, Eirgrid cabling development, and port infrastructure improvement. In addition, power and telecommunication cable application activity has increased from both commercial and state-led projects. In parallel, emerging case law and enhanced requirements arising from various environmental assessment Directives have added to the complexity of the appraisal process. <\/p><p>Over the last eighteen months, my Department has more than doubled the staffing resources available within the Foreshore Unit to address the increasing workload.

The NPF further underpins this approach by stating that \"in addition to legally binding targets agreed at EU level, it is a national objective for Ireland to transition to be a competitive low carbon, economy by the year 2050\".<\/p>  <p>  The three Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) also echo the importance of climate action and each contain a number of policy objectives in order to ensure emissions can be reduced and targets met.<\/p>  <p>  Under the relevant provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) (the Act), local authorities prepare development plans and local area plans to set out the planning policies and objectives for their respective functional areas. <\/p>  <p>  A programme of development plan review is currently underway in order to achieve consistency of approach with the NPF and the RSESs adopted by the three Regional Assemblies. <\/p>  <p>  National renewable energy objectives, and those set out in the regional strategies, are required to be reflected in county Development Plans. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, section 10(2) of the Act sets out the development objectives that must be included in the development plan of each local authority and are therefore &lsquo;mandatory&rsquo; requirements. Section 10(2)(n) specifically identifies climate action (adaption and mitigation) as a mandatory objective to be included in all Development Plans. <\/p>  <p>  These plans, which are adopted by the elected members of the local authority, are subject to review and evaluation by the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) to ensure consistency with national planning policy and guidance, including section 28 Ministerial Guidelines. Where matters arise in relation to consistency with national policy, further to a recommendation by the OPR, the Minister may decide to issue a planning authority with a Ministerial Direction under Section 31 of the Act, if a plan has failed to set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of an area.<\/p>  <p>  The SEAI published a Methodology for Local Authority Renewable Energy Strategies (LARES) in 2013 to assist local authorities in this regard. This methodology is currently being reviewed, with input from relevant bodies, to provide a best practice approach to identifying and assessing renewable energy resources in spatial planning at local authority level. Based on the indicative targets for onshore wind energy and grid-scale solar deployment, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) proposes to set out a target for the total onshore capacity that should be planned for on a national and regional level. The Regional Assemblies will be required to develop and implement regional renewable electricity strategies based on the overall national targets, renewable energy objectives contained in each of the RSESs, with the support of relevant guidance, including the SEAI LARES.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the construction sector, embodied carbon in construction materials makes a significant contribution to the lifetime carbon emissions of new buildings. The operational carbon emissions for heating, lighting and other services have been significantly reduced in Nearly Zero Energy Buildings. These building regulations requirements apply to all new buildings including social and affordable housing developments.  Currently these embodied carbon emissions are addressed in the Climate Action Plan and the Construction Products Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department has issued design guidelines for sustainable housing which includes recommendations relating to the need to have due regard to the environmental impact of construction materials.

This issue has been identified and is now fixed. While it has not been possible to immediately update all affected applications on the tracker, this will happen automatically when these applications reach the next stage of the process. The passport service apologies for any inconvenience caused to applicants who have been affected.  <\/p>  <p>  Applicants who wish to receive an update on the status of their passport application can contact the Customer Service Hub at (01) 6711633 or via Webchat on my Department's website (www.dfa.ie\/passports). The Passport Service Customer Service Hub officers respond to customer queries by phone and webchat as well as enquiries related to Emergency Passport cases. The Customer Service Hub are currently handling over 5,000 customer contacts each week. During times of high demand, there can be delays in getting through to a service agent due to the volumes of enquiries. The Passport Service webchat is also operational and customers should refresh the page if the icon is grey. A webchat operator is available when the icon is green. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 by the end of March. This represents a doubling of staff numbers over the course of 9 months. 109 new staff joined the Passport Service in the month of January. This is slightly lower than the estimate that was originally provided, as not all assignments that had been offered were accepted by candidates. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service:<\/p>  <p>  - Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications.<\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time.<\/p>  <p>  - A new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2022, the Passport Service received over 137,000 new passport applications. This is the highest volume of monthly applications ever received and indicates that there is pent-up demand for passports following the relaxation of necessary travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Passport Service estimates that up to 1.4 million passport applications will be received this year. Previous predictions for 2022 estimated a volume of 1.7m. However, for now this number has decreased due to the volume of passport renewal applications received in late 2021. The prediction for the number of passport applications in 2022 remains subject to review and the first six months of the year are still forecasted to remain very busy with most of the reduction in forecasted volume seen in the second half of the year.  <\/p>  <p>  While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. There is a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day. Figures show that there are currently 90,000 applications that are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. There are also 70,000 applications in the system where the Passport Service is waiting for the customer to complete the application. In these cases, the onus is on the customer to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.<\/p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:<\/p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this:<\/p>  <p>  - It is important to check the applicant&rsquo;s identity and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries. This is something we can all be proud of. However, in order to maintain this ranking and to protect the integrity of the Irish passport, the Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  - In the case of children, it is essential that the Passport Service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue. This ensures that the Passport Service protects the rights of the child and their guardians.<\/p>  <p>  - Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently processing 45% of adult online renewal application in one working day, while 99% of online child renewal passports are issued within the advertised processing time of 15 working days. <\/p>  <p>  The processing times for a standard online renewal passport applications compare very favourably to processing times internationally in countries such as the UK, United States, Canada and Australia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400073#WRS04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":735,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":736,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[10577\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of engagements, including online meetings, webinars, briefings and in-person meetings he or officials from his Department have had with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland from 1 January 2019 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":737,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has engaged with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland (NWCI) on a number of occasions from 1 January 2019 to date.<\/p><p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; Reconciliation Fund has provided support to the NWCI through two grants, totalling &euro;45,321, awarded in 2021 to support the establishment of their All-island Women&rsquo;s Forum.

First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. <\/p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:<\/p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p>  <p>  Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process. In cases of children whose parents are not Irish citizens, the process can sometimes take longer due to the need to ensure that all of the required supporting documentation to prove the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is submitted and correct. Due to the high level of complexity with these particular applications, further documentation is often required adding to the processing time.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 by the end of March. This represents a doubling of staff numbers over the course of 9 months.<\/p>  <p>  It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times for first time applicants in 2022. The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service:<\/p>  <p>  - Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications.<\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time.<\/p>  <p>  - A new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. <\/p>  <p>  We are confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service has been experiencing very high demand for passports since May 2021 and expects a high level of demand for passports to continue throughout this year. Currently, over 1.4m passport applications are anticipated this year compared to the previous pre-Covid-19 annual high of 935,000 in 2019. This is due to pent-up demand following Covid-19 public health restrictions over the past two years. Previous predictions for 2022 estimated a volume of 1.7m. However, for now this number has decreased due to the volume of passport renewal applications received in late 2021. The prediction for the number of passport applications in 2022 remains subject to review and the first six months of the year are still forecasted to remain very busy with most of the reduction in forecasted volume seen in the second half of the year.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2022, the Passport Service received over 137,000 new passport applications. This is the highest volume of monthly applications ever received and indicates that there is pent-up demand for passports following the relaxation of necessary travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 160,000 passport applications in the system. Of these, 20,000 are first time applications made within the State. While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. There is a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day. Figures show that, of the total 160,000 applications in the system, 90,000 (57%) applications are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 70,000 (43%) applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. <\/p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":752,"content":"<p>Question No. 287 answered with Question No. 284.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":753,"content":"<p>Question No. 288 answered with Question No. 284.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":754,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT02100"},{"type":"question","counter":755,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[10572\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT02200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of engagements, including online meetings, webinars, briefings and in-person meetings he or officials from his Department have had with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland from 1 January 2019 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":756,"content":"<p>In my capacity as Minister for Defence neither I, nor any official from my Department, has had any engagements, including online meetings, webinars, briefings and in-person meetings with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland from 1 January 2019 to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":758,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":757,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT02400"},{"type":"question","counter":758,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[10517\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400074#WRT02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to a lack of resourcing for reading schools in Dublin (details supplied); if she has any plans to increase supports for reading schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":759,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government. <\/p><p>This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>A continuum of education provision is in place covering the full range of need spanning placement in mainstream classes with supports through to more specialist placements either in a special class or a special school depending on the level of complexity of need. <\/p><p>Available supports include provision to meet care needs and to provide additional teaching support where this is required.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. <\/p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position.

My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. <\/p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400075#WRU00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":781,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400075#WRU01000"},{"type":"question","counter":782,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[10573\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400075#WRU01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of engagements, including online meetings, webinars, briefings and in-person meetings she or officials from her Department have had with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland from 1 January 2019 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":783,"content":"<p>The NWCI have not requested a meeting or briefing through my office .

In addition to improvements in core social welfare rates, there were a number of targeted measures designed to support those most vulnerable to poverty, including increases to the Fuel Allowance and Living Alone Allowance. As energy prices were increasing, I ensured that the increase to the Fuel Allowance rate was implemented from Budget week. I also broadened eligibility for the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these targeted measures, many of the most vulnerable pensioners have seen larger increases in 2022. For example, a pensioner in receipt of fuel allowance, living alone, will see an increase of &euro;13 per week during the fuel season due to measures introduced in Budget 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department, in as targeted a manner as possible.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment are required to satisfy a means test, while recipients of non-contributory payments are accepted as satisfying the means test.<\/p>  <p>  The amount of means allowed to qualify for fuel allowance is the equivalent of the current maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory) (SPC) including any increases, plus &euro;120. This means for example, that a person in receipt of SPC, with a qualifying spouse, may have a total weekly income of just over &euro;600 and still qualify for fuel allowance.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure measures costing in excess of a half a billion Euro, which will have a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.<\/p>  <p>  The measures include an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125, which will be paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment. It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.<\/p>  <p>  As such, this lump sum payment is intended to target the most vulnerable pensioners, as well as other social welfare recipients, to ensure that they are protected against rising fuel costs.<\/p>  <p>  This payment, in addition to the Budget increase to the Fuel Allowance, will mean low-income households see an increase of 41% this Fuel Allowance season compared to the last season.<\/p>  <p>  While not all pensioners will benefit from this lump sum payment, every household in the State will receive an Energy Credit of &euro;200, which will to be applied to electricity bills.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to monitor this situation carefully. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400076#WRV02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":845,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400076#WRV02900"},{"type":"question","counter":846,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[10599\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400076#WRV03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the progress that has been made to date in the determination of an application for illness benefit in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":847,"content":"<p>In order to qualify for Illness Benefit, a person must have 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited in the second last complete tax year from which the claim is made, or they must have 26 reckonable PRSI contributions paid in both the second last complete tax year and the year prior to that.

Examples under the Act are the offences of Riot as contrary to Section 14, Violent Disorder as contrary to Section 15, and Affray as contrary to Section 16.  Where a person has been arrested for those offences, and where certain circumstances arise, that person can be considered for detention and questioning under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 as amended.

Indeed, the maximum penalty in the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years in an amendment introduced via the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.<\/p><p>Legislative responses alone will not provide a ready solution and evidence from other jurisdictions indicate that simply adopting harsher penalties will not lead to a reduction in the incidence of these crimes. Our existing five-year sentence for knife possession is longer than in the UK, for example, where a four-year penalty applies.  It is important to note that there are no quick-fix solutions, based on international experience, and longer term, evidence-based strategies are needed. The issue of knife crime is currently being examined by a subgroup of the Antisocial Behaviour Forum, which is assessing available evidence to inform both legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices with regard to the issue. The work of this subgroup is ongoing and is expected to conclude in Q1 2022.<\/p><p>While the specific offences of 'serious assault' and 'grievous bodily harm' are not listed in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, (1997), the Deputy may wish to note that the Act provides for the following:<\/p><p>- A fine and\/or in imprisonment for up to 6 months for persons convicted of assault. <\/p><p>- An unlimited fine and\/or imprisonment for up to 5 years for persons convicted of assault causing harm.<\/p><p>- An unlimited fine and\/or a period of life imprisonment for persons convicted of causing serious harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400077#WRW04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":910,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400078#WRX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":911,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[10831\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400078#WRX00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will publish a list of the provisions enacted under justice legislation since 1994 that have yet to be commenced in the area of serious crime prevention; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":912,"content":"<p>It has not been possible to collate the information requested by the Deputy in the time allowed.

This is the full year requirement associated with the &euro;1.65 million that was provided from the Access to Care Fund in 2021 to support CHI paediatric orthopaedic activity at Cappagh. Furthermore, &euro;4.7 million has been provided on a recurring basis since 2021 to fund an additional 24 beds at Crumlin and Temple street, and 2 high dependency unit beds at Crumlin. These beds will facilitate the increase in activity needed to reduce paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. A further &euro;4 million has been committed for a theatre expansion programme across CHI sites to focus on paediatric orthopaedics. Capital funding of &euro;4 million has been designated to support this initiative, which is included within the 2022 Capital Plan due to be approved shortly. Finally, &euro;2 million has been provided for outsourcing initiatives for both inpatient and daycase procedures, as well as to meet radiology needs.

These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; Parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.

This removed a disincentive against the sale of properties that might otherwise remain vacant. The Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the Housing for All Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties \"in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people\". <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and I remain committed to ensuring that the NHSS will continue to deliver value for money in the provision of nursing home care as well as ensuring the provision of care which is affordable for residents and their families and appropriate to the needs of nursing home residents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400079#WRY03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":989,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400079#WRY03500"},{"type":"question","counter":990,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[10667\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022400079#WRY03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current level of HSE podiatry staff servicing acute and community services in County Wexford;

The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The taskforce will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan. <\/p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in my Department.

The new facility will accommodate up to 17,000 outpatient and 25,000 emergency care attendances per year.<\/p><p>  Together with the Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital, which opened in July 2019, these new facilities will improve access to urgent, emergency and outpatient care for a significant number of children. In 2021, there were over 13,300 outpatient attendances at Connolly and almost 11,400 patients presented for urgent care.<\/p><p>Work on the St James&rsquo;s site is ongoing and progressing well with major milestones reached in 2021, including the completion of the concrete frame with over 150,000 cubic metres of concrete poured, the topping out of the building (where the highest point on the building was completed- a significant milestone in any construction project), the infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame, the closing in of the concourse and approximately 17,000 square metres of glazing and 5,800 square metres of external fa&ccedil;ade installed. <\/p><p>To date, 86,000 square metres of internal partitions have been installed, with the equivalent of over 26 kilometres installed in 2021, and the fit out of most internal areas is now underway, including the south fingers comprising Outpatients, Cardiology Wards, and Therapies spaces, and the &lsquo;Hot Block&rsquo; comprising Emergency Department, Critical Care and Theatres. Work in 2022 will be focused on the progression of the internal fit-out of the over 6,000 internal spaces.<\/p><p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) has advised that the main contractor&rsquo;s current programme schedule outlines completion can be achieved by December 2023 which would mean the NCH at St James&rsquo;s could open in the second half of 2024, after the necessary commissioning period. The NPHDB is working to ensure that contractor will meet its own schedule.<\/p><p>In 2018, Government approved a capital budget of &euro;1.433bn for the NCH project. This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. The capital budget has not yet been depleted and, to date, &euro;924.4m of the &euro;1.433bn budget has been drawn down for works on the project across the three sites.<\/p><p>There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes, and the Employment Order.<\/p><p>Additional costs in relation to the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites brings the total programme cost to &euro;1.73 billion. This includes investment in ICT, including a new Electronic Health Record system, the Children's Hospital Integration Programme (the merging of three paediatric hospitals) including commissioning, and pre-2013 project expenditure relating to the former Mater project.<\/p><p>Brexit and the global pandemic have severely impacted supply chains and NCH project is not immune to these external challenges.

In addition, a National Vaccination Programme was rolled out with the immediate establishment of mass vaccination centres across the country, which required a large amount of external recruitment capacity. Through third party recruitment agencies, the HSE recruited approximately 3,000 people in COVID-19 vaccination centres and for test and trace operations.
