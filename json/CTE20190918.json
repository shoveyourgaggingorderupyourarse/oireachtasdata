I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Celeste O'Callaghan, principal officer; Dr. Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medial officer; and Mr. Stephen Brophy, principal officer in the Department.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the committee on the ongoing work to ensure a sustainable and effective national cervical screening programme and to address that have arisen since April 2018.  The Department's priority focus is on implementing the recommendations of Dr. Scally's scoping inquiry, overseeing the completion of the independent clinical expert review led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and working with the HSE to ensure capacity issues are addressed and to implement the switch to HPV primary screening.  <br\/><br\/>A further focus is on improving support for patient representation and putting in place an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme for the women and next-of-kin affected by non-disclosure of retrospective audit results, as well as the promised CervicalCheck tribunal.<br\/><br\/>Following his final report in September last year, Dr. Scally carried out a supplementary report which was published in June of this year.  As the committee is aware, the supplementary report identified a number of issues including contractual compliance and the use of additional sites for the screening of slides without CervicalCheck's knowledge.  Crucially, the report also stated that, on the basis of the information available to the inquiry, the use of these additional laboratories did not result in a reduction in the quality of the screening provided to Irish women and that there is no evidence to suggest deficiencies in screening quality in any laboratory.  This is, obviously, very welcome reassurance from the perspective of women's health.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the reassurance on screening quality provided by Dr. Scally's report, he identified a significant range of issues in the cervical screening programme that must be addressed.  Dr. Scally's recommendations have been accepted in full by Government and an implementation plan was published in December, setting out more than 160 actions to be undertaken by all organisations involved.  The Department has overseen progress in this regard and it has been steady, with more than half of these actions completed by the end of quarter two of this year.<br\/><br\/>The supplementary report of the scoping inquiry added two further recommendations and actions to address these are being incorporated in the overall implementation plan which will be published together with the quarter three report in October.<br\/><br\/>Smear test turnaround times have been a cause of significant concern for many women and there has been very good progress in recent weeks in this regard.  In early May, MedLab ceased to accept new slides in order to focus on processing the backlog of smears in that lab.  The HSE has now confirmed that, last month, MedLab completed in full the processing of its smear test backlog.  <br\/><br\/>All smears are now being processed either by the Coombe or by Quest Diagnostics and turnaround times have significantly improved.  Colleagues in the HSE will provide more detail on turnaround times and what women can expect over the coming weeks and months.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of the HPV test as the primary screening test was approved by the Minister in early 2018 and its introduction will be a significant milestone for the programme.  Notwithstanding the challenges faced over the past year and more, the staff in the National Screening Service have continued to make strong progress across the various work streams required to effect this change.<\/p><p>The Minister recently approved the HSE&rsquo;s draft project plan for the switch to HPV testing early next year.  Funding has been made available in budget 2019 to support the necessary work. <br\/><br\/>Recognising that colposcopy clinics are experiencing pressures, additional funding is being provided this year both to address the immediate pressures and to improve resourcing as part of the introduction of the HPV primary screening test, which is expected to lead to increased referrals to colposcopy after the first year. <br\/><br\/>The review led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, will provide each woman, or her next-of-kin, who consented to participate, with an independent report to provide them with assurance about the timing of their diagnosis and treatment. The Department has been engaging on an ongoing basis with the RCOG and the HSE over the past number of months on the operational aspects of the review and the process for communicating individual reports to women.  The HSE will provide further detail on preparations in this regard at this meeting. <br\/><br\/>The RCOG will prepare an aggregate report for the Minister, which will include recommendations, where appropriate, on improving care for women.  The RCOG wrote to the Minister on 6 September last advising that the aggregated report will be provided in October.  It also advised that, based on the provisional findings of its review, the performance characteristics of the CervicalCheck screening programme that fall within the scope of the review appear to be broadly in line with the experience in the UK. <br\/><br\/>A further focus for the Department this year has been the introduction of legislation to establish the CervicalCheck Tribunal, which became law on 23 July.  The Department is working on the practical arrangements to be put in place, and on the rules, processes and procedures required.  Work is also progressing on the legislative provision for restoration of trust meetings. <br\/><br\/>In addition, an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme has been put in place for women or next-of-kin affected by the non-disclosure of retrospective audit results.  Most recent figures are that 156 applications have been made with 152 assessments made.  The scheme remains open. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>There is wide recognition in the health sector that patients have an important role to play in the development of health policy and the reform of health services.  It is essential that the patient voice be at the centre of the work under way to address the range of issues arising in relation to CervicalCheck.  Both the CervicalCheck steering committee and the HSE oversight group include patient representatives. <br\/><br\/>Recognising the issues that have been highlighted by Dr. Scally and others in regard to payment for patient representatives, the Department has recently commenced work on the development of a policy for the selection and payment of patient representatives within the Department of Health and the HSE. <br\/><br\/>The Department has also provided funding to the 221+ CervicalCheck support group to enable it to support the 221 women and families involved in this issue.  Most recently, the Department has agreed in principle to provide further funding to enable the 221+ group to offer support to additional women identified through the RCOG review as having discordant smear test results. <br\/><br\/>To conclude, I have set out some of the key areas of progress so far.  The Department intends to continue a strong focus on the key priorities of implementation of the recommendations of Dr. Scally, the completion of the RCOG review and introduction of HPV primary screening, ensuring this lifesaving programme continues to deliver improvements in women&rsquo;s health. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracey Conroy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I am joined by my colleagues Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, HSE, Dr. Lorraine Doherty, clinical director, CervicalCheck, Ms Celine Fitzgerald, interim CEO of the National Screening Service, and Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the women and infants programme.<\/p> <p>  We continue to address and manage a vast range of issues that have emerged as a result of the crisis in the CervicalCheck programme in April 2018.  Our priority areas remain stabilising and strengthening our cervical screening programme; continuing to support women and families who were directly impacted by the CervicalCheck crisis; improving communications with women and increasing public engagement in our screening programmes; implementing Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations from each of his reports, supporting the independent external review being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, RCOG; implementing the recent recommendations from the rapid review carried out by Professor Brian MacCraith; continued strengthening of the governance and resourcing within our screening programmes; and enhancing the quality assurance of the programmes and implementing HPV primary screening. <\/p> <p>  Our Information line and client services unit continues to provide information to women and their families.  We also support women and their families in the provision of access to their records and ensuring women get their slides from laboratories, where required, for legal review.  The client services unit in our national screening service continues to support this process.  We have provided healthcare records to 631 women and have also provided 332 slides to women, families or their representatives.  We continue to support the 221+ group through our community liaison officers.  The community liaison officers support women and their families in provision of the support packages provided to the Government.  We are also working closely with the 221 patient representatives across a wide range of areas and are very grateful for their guidance and input to the screening programmes.  It is helping to make a real difference. <\/p> <p>  We have just completed a public and patient inclusion plan for our screening services.  This was developed in conjunction with our patient representatives.  This was also highlighted as an area to be strengthened in Professor MacCraith&rsquo;s report and his recommendations have been incorporated in our plan.<\/p> <p>  Some key actions within the plan include appointment of a full-time patient inclusion officer, extension of the screening patient panel, putting patients on key committees and a model for patient inclusion.  Our patient panel for cervical screening continues to operate and has already provided critical input into specific areas such as the information and communications materials provided to women and families.  We also have patient representatives on a number of key project groups within screening services with the inclusion of two patient representatives on the HSE oversight group, which provides the governance over the implementation of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report and all other CervicalCheck related issues. <\/p> <p>  We are very grateful to the many patient representatives who voluntarily give up their time to support our screening programmes.  We have made a start in this area and remain committed to having patients at the centre of our screening programmes. <\/p> <p>  The HSE continues to support the independent international expert panel review being undertaken by RCOG, which was established by the Minister for Health, following a Government decision, for women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HSE supported the consent process; established a national helpdesk; developed an eligible dataset with the National Cancer Registry; and implemented a client management system to support RCOG, in addition to co-ordinating the release of slides culminating in the completion of RCOG's review.  We are working closely with the Department of Health in supporting the RCOG where required. <\/p> <p>  Some 1,074 women consented to participate in the review.  RCOG is now transferring the individual reports to the HSE for dissemination to women and their families.  The dissemination of reports is commencing on a phased basis in the coming weeks.  We expect this process to take up until the end of 2019 in order for all results to be provided and meetings to be held, where requested, by the women and their families. <\/p> <p>  Issues emerged regarding delays in notification letters being issued to women arising from the HPV expiration issue.  The HSE CEO commissioned a rapid review to ensure that any lessons learned from the issue were identified and implemented, which was undertaken by Professor Brian MacCraith.  The HSE has accepted all of these recommendations.  An implementation plan has been developed to support the recommendations and many of the actions identified will be completed by the end of 2019.  These have been incorporated into the implementation plan for Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations to ensure an integrated implementation plan within the HSE.  While the issue represented a low clinical risk for the women involved, we would like to reiterate our apology for any upset they may have been caused. <\/p> <p>  In 2018 around 370,000 women presented to the programme, an increase from 280,000 in 2017.  This was an increase of around 90,000 and caused significant backlog in reporting results to women.  We have worked with existing private providers, other private providers and public service providers in other countries to try to grow our laboratory capacity to address this issue.  Following a global search and complex negotiations we have managed to secure additional laboratory capacity that has enabled us to eliminate the backlog to ensure more reasonable turnaround times for women.  The number of slides in the backlog was at approximately 81,346 which has largely been eliminated.  We would normally expect that approximately 23,000 slides would be in the screening process at all times.  The turnaround times for reporting of results were at one point taking up to six months and these have now reduced to an average of six weeks.  We hope to sustain the turnaround times at this level.  This will ensure that women and their GPs get their results in a reasonable time period. <\/p> <p>  A key risk to enable cervical screening to continue in Ireland was the extension of the laboratory contracts.  The HSE reached agreement with both the Coombe and Quest to enable continuity of the programme.  The HSE also made a decision to expand the public laboratory capacity and to develop a National Cervical Screening Laboratory, which is included in our recent HSE capital plan.  This will provide a better balance between public and private laboratory capacity provision.  A project steering group and project team are now in place with building and workforce plans developed.  While we are planning for a rapid build programme it will still take a number of years to implement, primarily due to the challenge of recruiting suitably qualified staff. <\/p> <p>  Our colposcopy services remain under pressure with increased referrals and the requirement for increased consultation time.  The HSE women and infants programme recently completed an impact assessment on colposcopy services that identified some immediate resource requirements.  Funding has been allocated in the 2019 national service plan and this resource is currently being rolled out to the clinics to support additional service sessions, to increase capacity and improve waiting times.<\/p> <p>  We continue to implement our plan to introduce HPV primary screening.  A project team has been in place since last year and there are seven work streams involved in the project.  We have completed a review of international HPV primary screening implementations, including site visits, to ensure that the lessons learned from other jurisdictions can be applied in Ireland.<\/p><p>We have completed a review of international human papillomavirus, HPV, primary screening implementation, including site visits, to ensure that the lessons learned from other jurisdictions can be applied in Ireland.  We remain committed to implementing HPV primary screening as soon as possible, with the aim for implementation in the first quarter of 2020.  Since we last appeared before the committee, we have reduced some of the major risks to the project through the reduction in the backlog and securing laboratory providers that can provide the testing service.  We still face significant challenges with the information technology system changes and to ensure sufficient availability of colposcopy services to address future demand from HPV primary screening on colposcopy services.<\/p><p> I advise the committee that we recently introduced the HPV vaccine for boys.  Combined with the existing uptake of the HPV vaccine by girls will help reduce incidence of cervical and other cancers.  Evidence from elsewhere in the world, including Australia and Scotland, demonstrates that this combination of HPV vaccine and HPV primary screening will have the impact of eliminating cervical cancer over the next two to three decades and in the shorter term ensuring that women present with the disease earlier, meaning they would be less likely to progress to cancer.<\/p><p> The HSE has contributed significantly to the development of an implementation plan in collaboration with other State agencies in response to the Scally scoping inquiry recommendations.  A senior manager appointed in September 2018 continues to oversee and drive the implementation of the report by Dr. Scally, including the supplementary report published in June 2019.  An oversight group was also established in the HSE to support and ensure continued implementation of the Scally report recommendations and other challenges in our screening services.  The group is co-chaired by our chief clinical officer and the chief operations officer.  In response to the reports from Dr. Scally, we have developed a set of 116 actions arising from recommendations that are the responsibility of the HSE to implement, and we are reviewing appropriate actions against each recommendation as the implementation progresses.  As of today, a total of 78 actions have been completed, with the remainder in progress.<\/p><p> Examples of progress to date include key appointments and governance improvements in the National Screening Service and CervicalCheck.  An organisational review of risk management structures has also been commissioned by the HSE, in addition to the establishment of an expert group within the National Screening Service to review clinical audit processes across all screening programmes.  Reports from both these groups are expected in the coming weeks.  A review of the HSE's healthcare records management policy has also been commenced.<\/p><p> One of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations included setting out the future approach to interval cancer audit.  The HSE established an oversight group for this project with expert groups.  The expert groups are independently chaired and comprise patients, patient advocates, a patient ethicist, screening clinicians and international experts.  The expert groups have considered international best practice as part of the work, and we expect them to report in the fourth quarter of 2019.<\/p><p> An interim revision of the open disclosure policy has been completed and was published in June 2019.  The HSE remains committed to ensuring the operation of open disclosure throughout the organisation by continuing to roll out its national training programme and the establishment of a national open disclosure office.  An open disclosure governance steering group has been established in the HSE, and the group is chaired by the national director of quality improvement.  An open disclosure framework has been developed.  The governance framework and the group will provide leadership for the evaluation of audit of compliance with the open disclosure policy.  All recommendations relating to procurement in Dr. Scally's report have been implemented.<\/p><p> Recruitment and retention of staff remains a significant challenge for our screening services.  We have progressed a review of the organisation design of the National Screening Service, and one of the key actions was the appointment of a permanent chief executive officer.  I expect the advertisement for the permanent chief executive officer to issue towards the end of September.  We have recently appointed an interim chief executive, Ms Celine Fitzgerald, for our screening services while we recruit a permanent chief executive for the service.  We have appointed a permanent quality and risk manager for screening services and prioritised the recruitment of additional posts in quality and risk management.  A deputy laboratory co-ordinator is now in place to strengthen the laboratory capacity in the programme.  We have just completed a recruitment process for the CervicalCheck programme manager to work with the recently recruited deputy CervicalCheck programme manager.<\/p><p> We were unsuccessful in recruiting a programme colposcopy adviser and are commencing an international recruitment campaign for this role.  In addition, we are preparing to go to recruitment for a CervicalCheck primary care adviser and a CervicalCheck colposcopy nurse, which will further strengthen the clinical input to the programme.  We are also recruiting a permanent director of public health for the National Screening Service and additional public health specialist positions.  This will strengthen the public health input to the programme.  Posts in communications and human resources have also been advertised in addition to a number of other programme support roles.  We will ensure that the recruitment of all posts from the National Screening Service workforce plan continue to be prioritised.<\/p><p> I assure members that the HSE is absolutely focused on continuing to stabilise and strengthen our screening services.  All possible resources are being directed at this challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today.

It is the accreditation of medical testing laboratories to ISO 15189 and assessing procedural and technical standards to demonstrate competence to perform cytology screening.  The scoping inquiry&rsquo;s report identified a procedural lapse that occurred within the INAB accreditation process, specifically relating to MedLab, and I will elaborate on how this took place.  MedLab was first accredited by INAB in 2011 for cytology screening following an assessment by an independent team of technical assessors, and this has been verified annually.  The company&rsquo;s principal location for this operation has always been based in Dublin.  In November 2016, MedLab contacted INAB by email, proposing to hire a cytology screening employee - a cytoscreener - and to locate that person at its laboratory in Manchester.  At the time, INAB considered the information, consulted technical assessors, and was of the opinion that the activities, monitoring and controls that were understood for the cytoscreening in Manchester would be in line with ISO 15189.  INAB informed MedLab by reply email that, in principle, such a proposal potentially would be acceptable.<\/p> <p>  The matter of cytoscreening at the Manchester laboratory was not subsequently raised directly again by MedLab with INAB.  The procedural lapse that arose within INAB is that we did not subsequently and formally follow through on this information.  From November 2016 onwards, INAB continued its usual annual assessments of MedLab in Dublin, which confirmed continued compliance to ISO 15189 each year.  During the assessments of cytology screening, the INAB technical assessor, a consultant histopathologist, assessed the competency records of all MedLab screening staff.  The lead assessor assessed the laboratory management system and no major findings for cytology screening were raised during these assessments.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting that MedLab employees who were subsequently confirmed as based in the Manchester site were included in the INAB annual assessment.  However, their exact location was not readily apparent to the INAB assessment team from the records examined.  Following INAB&rsquo;s engagement with the scoping inquiry earlier this year, it became apparent that cytology screening at the Manchester site - referred to in MedLab&rsquo;s email to INAB in November 2016 - was in fact fully operational.  We now understand from the scoping inquiry&rsquo;s report that MedLab began cytology screening in the Manchester site in February 2016.  We immediately conducted a review within INAB in conjunction with our technical assessors.  The main outcomes of this were as follows.<\/p> <p>  The competence of all relevant MedLab staff to perform cytology screening was assessed in detail by our technical assessors each year since 2016.  The Manchester site was under the direct control and management of MedLab.  The staff at the Manchester site were employed by and under the direct supervision of MedLab.  The Manchester site was using identical documentation, work instructions, information technology and reporting mechanisms issued and controlled from the Dublin site.  Employees in the Manchester site were included in the overall MedLab quality system and were monitored exactly as employees based in Ireland.  On completion of this review and based on the evidence, INAB confirmed to the scoping inquiry that the cytoscreening conducted at the Manchester site was within the scope of the accreditation of MedLab.<\/p> <p>  We followed up this review with a specific on-site visit to Manchester in April 2019 as part of our annual surveillance visit to MedLab in Dublin.  The review satisfied us that the cytoscreening at the Manchester site was accredited under ISO 15189 and the management system of the MedLab Dublin office.<\/p><p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, we do not think it acceptable to have been unaware of or not formally notified of, the specific external location of some of MedLab Pathology Limited&rsquo;s cytoscreeners in the Manchester laboratory.  Our review determined that a more specific, direct and robust level of communication should have taken place between INAB and MedLab Pathology Limited at the outset.  It is clearly our responsibility to ensure that all applicants for accreditation and accredited bodies keep us fully and clearly informed about proposals to modify or extend their accredited activities in order that these proposals can be scrutinised as fully as is necessary before being implemented.  We immediately put in place procedures to rule out any further such occurrence arising.  This includes scrutiny of the exact locations of any personnel within organisations seeking accreditation, implementation of new technology to track all such matters through our system, and checks and balances to monitor our own systems and staff.<\/p><p> In summary, it is the case that MedLab continues to meet the requirements of ISO 15189.  It is also very important to emphasise that nothing in our review and assessments or in the scoping inquiry report, suggests that the quality of cytoscreening conducted at the Manchester site was of a lower standard to that conducted at the Dublin site.  I will now hand back to Dr. McGuinness to conclude our comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Adrienne Duff","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The overall matters being inquired into by the scoping inquiry are of the highest possible importance to women and society in general and we take them very seriously indeed.

One issue relates directly to a constituent of mine, a lady called Claire Healy, who decided, because of the fact that she was a high risk patient, to get a private screening.  On foot of the results of same, when she went to the public system she was advised and told she would not be seen as a public patient because her test had been obtained privately.  Deputy Donnelly has been in constant contact with Ms Healy and I understand that as of last night, following months of being ignored, she received an email and a communication from the Minister's office to say the issue was resolved and people would have access to the public system whether they were tested privately or publicly.  To get that call on a Tuesday night at 10 p.m. prior to the witnesses coming before the committee on Wednesday morning is the most crass attempt at media manipulation I have come across with this particular issue.  I want to ask the witnesses a number of questions directly from Claire Healy because she has asked me to do so on her behalf and I am quite happy to do it.  The first question is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>In late August, Kerry Colposcopy Unit issued a reply to me stating that they were instructed by Cervical Check to prioritise public test results.  Who then made the decision in Cervical Check to exclude every woman who decided to access private testing, in an attempt to alleviate the pressure on an already overburdened system?<\/blockquote> <p>The second question is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Cervical Check decided to prioritise public tests.  Do you really feel refusing and ignoring private test results, refusing women, is an acceptable way to address the chronic waiting times in an effort to hide the numbers?<\/blockquote> <p>The third question is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>When I was refused my test, I looked for answers at a time of great worry and stress for my young family.  I was ignored by your Department.  Why was it that I had to go to great lengths and go public in order to get very basic answers?  Last night a late e-mail was sent to me from your office and that was the first acknowledgement of the awful situation I find myself in.  It took over two months to get a reply from your office?  Why are the lines of communication firmly shut?<\/blockquote> <p>The fourth question is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>I now find myself in a situation awaiting biopsy results and waiting for further answers.  The Colposcopy Unit in Kerry told me that as they are now processing both public and private test results, they are overwhelmed with those waiting for results.  I am told I will be waiting for between 4-8 weeks minimum before I discover if I have cervical cancer!  What is being done to shorten the waiting lists and provide extra services?  When will the Minister start to make changes which puts Women First?<\/blockquote> <p>The final question is as follows, &quot;Following all the revelations during the last year, why is there still no helpline, or central communications hub for women with concerns of this kind to ring?&quot;<\/p><p>I have a second series of questions relating to the Sharon case and the IT glitch but I would like the witnesses to answer those first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#F00400","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will make one or two comments to the Deputy.

They can be strengthened through the information line, the correspondence or various other means.  While I accept what the Deputy said when he described Ms Healy's case, I would say things have improved over time.  The CervicalCheck line which would have received a very small number of calls in previous years received tens of thousands last year.  The number of calls has reduced this year.  One of the key factors that, understandably, caused concern for women was the delays they encountered as they waited for their test results and tried to understand where they were at.  That is something at which we are looking.  We have seen a decline in the number of calls as a result of the improvement in turnaround times.  It is hoped this will be of assistance as attempts are made to strengthen the communication loop.  I accept the point that it needs to be improved.  There is an information line in place.  The challenge relates to the multiple sources that can be used to raise queries.  We need to make sure they are brought together in a more unified manner.

We discussed what was required under the headings of personnel and staff, equipment and minor infrastructural changes.  These requirements have been collated; the plan has been submitted and funding allocated to approve them.  One of the most striking things we found was a consistent increase across the country in the number of non-cytology referrals to colposcopy clinics.  The colposcopy clinics are designed to deal with people with cytology abnormalities.  Historically, a small proportion - between 5% and 10% - of those going to colposcopy clinics were women who had symptoms such as abnormal bleeding.  In the last year that small proportion has increased to between 35% and 50%.  The colposcopy clinics are finding it difficult to cope with the extra cohort of patients.  The reason for the increase in the number of clinical referrals reflects an anxiety in the community and primary care services.  Patients are very conscious of the need not to neglect symptoms.  The number of patients being processed in colposcopy units has increased.  Arguably, these clinical referrals are inappropriate for colposcopy units.  With that in mind, we are seeking to find a method to take them out of colposcopy clinics.  We are exploring how funding can be sourced to see them being dealt with more rapidly outside the colposcopy environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter McKenna"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I understand I will get a second chance to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#G01000","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#G01100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I want to revisit the IT glitch issue and the case of Sharon which was highlighted in the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#G01200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I will let the Deputy in a second time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#G01300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Okay.

In normal circumstances, when a woman presents to a GP or another smear taker because she is concerned about the delay in obtaining a smear test result through the system, she may be referred to the private service to have the smear taken.  The result normally comes back to the GP or the smear taker who acts on the result by referring the patient to a colposcopy clinic if it indicates that this should happen.  Is it now the case that, regardless of whether the smear was taken in the public or private system, when the GP or smear taker refers the woman to a colposcopy clinic, there is no barrier to prevent her from being seen in that clinic?  That seems to be the issue.  The private smear was received by the smear taker who acted appropriately, but the colposcopy unit decided that it was not going to accept the result because it was a private smear.

Ms Fitzgerald and others have joined in recent times.  There is a wider recruitment challenge.  There are specific challenges in laboratories and in trying to resource colposcopy.  Each part of the pathway presents different challenges.<\/p> <p>  We made a decision towards the tail end of last year to develop a national cervical screening laboratory.  An agreement was reached with the Coombe Hospital that it would be provided there.  We believe this will take some time.  The planning permission application is being made this week for the new build for the new facility.  The design is completed and the Coombe has signed off on it.  The building is expected to be finished by the end of 2021 and it was in the capital plan announced recently.<\/p> <p>  The challenge I alluded to in my opening statement relates to trying to attract and retain the staff we need to operate the laboratory.  We also have a challenge with the fact that the Coombe Hospital has a very small base with regard to the programme.  It has only been involved in it for a short period.  Currently, it processes approximately 10% of the slides.  It is a very important laboratory because in recent months it has also taken on additional colposcopy work, which is more complex with regard to the smears and the multidisciplinary meetings that need to follow.  We have developed a workforce plan and a steering group to develop the project, which is jointly chaired by the Coombe and the HSE.  We have people working full-time on developing it.  We have identified 22 resources needed over coming years.  Immediate approval has gone out for ten resources to be recruited and competitions are running for them.  We are trying to be opportunistic with regard to where we can source some of these scarce resources, be they consultants or medical scientists.  Currently, one permanent consultant and another locum consultant are working in the hospital.  We have sanctioned a number of additional consultant posts but our challenge is trying to attract medical consultants into what is a specialised and quite a challenging area.  We have had some success in identifying possible candidates and we are trying to work them through for additional posts.  Up to four consultant posts will be authorised for the hospital but, as I have said, the challenge will be trying to fill them.  There is also the scalability issue with regard to when we will be able to have growth in the Coombe.  We believe we can get it to 40% to 50% over the next 18 months of the programme.  Beyond this, it is contingent on being able to attract the right type of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#H01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Surely it will also be contingent on being able to train the right people.

I speak as someone who uses the service.  I am not happy that smear tests are bouncing all over the world.  My instinct is that the best defence is to have the smear tests read here in this jurisdiction.  It is one thing to say we all would like this to be happening and that it is being looked into and discussed but it does not seem as though much is being done.

A workforce plan has been developed which looks at all aspects.  Critical within the laboratory is the logistics and the operation is where much of the heavy numbers are in staffing.  Equally, there are medical scientists and consultants.  If one does not have medical consultants, one cannot provide the service or one is constrained in the volume and scale that can be provided.<\/p> <p>  The workforce plan has been agreed, the Coombe has ten posts, which it is now advertising and recruiting.  On the medical side, we have identified additional posts.  They are in the middle of trying to look for those posts.  Some are going through the recruitment process but it will be very challenging to recruit people.  We have tried to broaden out the nature of the role to make it more attractive to consultants.  On the medical scientist side, the Coombe has a programme running with the institutes in Dublin.  It is also recruiting and ran a campaign in recent months to recruit people.  We are actively trying to increase capacity within the Coombe. There is also a sensible growth volume.  Moving from 10% to a larger amount requires that it be done in a very safe, sustained way to ensure that one does not create difficulties for the existing laboratory.  Finally, the new facility will go to planning this week.  The money is in the capital plan.  It will be completed, if on target, by the end of 2021.  Very significant steps are being taken.  I take the point that we need to try to accelerate the process but we are trying to push it across each of the three staff categories of medical, medical scientist and the logistics and operation piece.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Finally in this round, I believe Ms Conroy spoke of extra money being provided.

Last night I had the pleasure of being at the official book launch of Vicky Phelan's amazing book, which I am pleased to say is number one in the non-fiction chart.  I met a range of people there who are very much affected by this crisis.  I took the opportunity to scan their views and to listen to them for hours with a view to the questions I would pose this morning.  The seven questions I will ask are based on doing this.  I will ask them together, as it will make the best use of time.  I ask that everyone answer them fully and directly, not in a generic fashion, as they are quite specific.<\/p> <p>  I listened to Mr. McCallion provide the basic information on the 221 and the laboratories, what labs were used and on what dates, etc.  I have good time for Mr. McCallion but I just do not buy this and I am not sure that Mr. McCallion does himself.  Tony O'Brien, to be fair to him, said in May last year that this information should be available within weeks.  The 221 have asked for this information in that detail since last December.  It is now September.  There is a reason why this information is not being given out.  Will Mr. McCallion be honest and tell us?  <\/p> <p>  If we have learned anything over the past year or so, it is that we must be open and honest with the 221 campaign and the patient representatives, Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap.  Mr. McCallion is saying that it will take another four weeks to collate this information.  The information is available to him.  I can guarantee that.  If the patient representatives write to Mr. McCallion today and ask for the information, as he currently has it, in whatever state it is, will he give it to them?  That is my first question.  That information is available and Mr. McCallion should not tell me that it is not.  If it is not collatable and available, there is a level of incompetence in the HSE that means that we have bigger issues than those about which we already know.  This is a very simple desktop exercise.  It could be done in one hour, never mind a year and a half.  I ask Mr. McCallion to answer this very directly.  We need to know the information.  I have information from my own sampling, which suggests certain trends but we need the real facts.<\/p> <p>  My second question is specifically for the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, and the Department.  I acknowledge the apology and regret for what happened by the representatives from INAB.  What happened is very unprofessional and unacceptable.  I have been trying to piece together a jigsaw around Dr. Scally's second report and what happened.  The report was due in the middle of February but was suddenly postponed for many months.  Responding to several of my questions and at committee meetings, Dr. Scally has stated there was no exact date when he discovered the laboratory in Salford was unaccredited.  I have listened to him dance around the issue and I have listened to INAB do the same.  On what date did INAB find out that this laboratory was not accredited and by whom?  Will INAB provide the committee with all communication, written in any format, electronic or otherwise, from its parent Department, namely, Health, the HSE or the Scally inquiry or both, as well as from any members of its team, to this committee in respect of the issue of this lab?  I want to know the date when they found out this was not accredited.  Moreover, in a question to which many people want an answer, how can a lab be accredited retrospectively?  I could read out a dictionary definition of quality assurance.  How can INAB guarantee that everything that went on in that lab was to the standard required?  We ought not forget that between 2016 and 2018, 91,000 smear tests went through there, not counting the free smears as we do not have those figures.  <\/p> <p>  The third question is probably for Dr. McKenna or whichever representative on that side wishes to take it.  On colposcopy waiting times, we are told that CIN 3 should be four weeks.  The target is 90% in four weeks; it is now 70% and getting worse.  CIN 1 should be eight weeks.  The target is 90% at that level, but is also at 70% and getting worse.  This is a serious problem.  What is being done to address this?  Given that HPV screening is being introduced, which I greatly wish to see, and accuracy levels will improve and so on, how will we deal with that as the number of referrals should increase in a good way?  What plans are being put in place to deal with that?<\/p><p>My next question is for the representatives from the Department of Health.  Dr. Scally visited seven of the 16 laboratories.  He accidentally gave us misinformation regarding his visit to the laboratories, which, in fairness, he corrected.  We now know that there was retrospective accreditation of one laboratory.  He also stated that it was surprising and disturbing.  I have the schedule of all of the non-visits to all of the other laboratories.  How can we be guaranteed that there was not outsourcing, in any capacity, in any of the other laboratories ever over that period?  I have a real concern on that issue and I would like to get some answers.  <\/p><p> My next question concerns the RCOG review.  I have to acknowledge, first, that there has been some learning in the area of communications.  The HSE believes that 40% of all slides will have some form of different outcome.  Some 1,047 women are involved in that review.  Using that 40% percentage means that 430 women will have a different outcome.  That seems high but 40% is referenced in the steering group minutes of July 2018.  How can that percentage be explained?  I ask the representatives from the Department of Health to please not insult me by stating that it is down to site review, bias or anything like that.  Why do the representatives from the Department think that it is going to be 40%, as referenced in the minutes?  <\/p><p> My next question is interconnected.  This 40% is referenced the July minutes.  Regarding the current position, I have raised for the past year and a half the fact that I believe it is wrong that the audit has just stopped.  That is going to cause serious issues in the future.  I do not have time to discuss this now, but it will cause serious issues and that must be faced up to now.  The quicker this issue is dealt with the better.  The trajectory of discordance of sampling, I have heard, is continuing post the audit.  I want to know when the audit will be brought back, what proposal there is to do that and why the Department of Health continues to ensure that it is stopped.  I ask that because, if we look at this based on what is going to come out in the RCOG review, the Department is going to have a much more serious problem, given the statistics it has stated itself.<\/p><p> Regarding what happened with the accreditation of the laboratory in Manchester, it is obvious that there was a breach of contract in some way.  The Department of Health found out about this some significant time ago.  I am not fully sure of the dates because they seem confusing.  I have been given multiple dates.  The Department, however, found out about this in January or February of this year.  I presume it was before 14 February.  That was when Dr. Scally was meant to publish his report but the date was pushed back following questions of the Secretary General of the Department at this committee.  He stated that it was imminent but then the publication date suddenly changed.  Obviously, that had something to do with the laboratory in Manchester and other quality assurance issues.  <\/p><p> There is, however, a contractual issue in this regard.  Any competent organisation will deal swiftly with a contractual issue of this seriousness and magnitude, which is causing such public concern.  Will the representatives from the Department of Health provide the committee with all the details, in writing, of the efforts that the Department has made, and contact it has, with the organisation I referenced in trying to deal with that contractual issue?  Will they also update this committee now on what has been done with company concerning that contract?  This is an issue that the Department would have to have dealt with swiftly by now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#J00900","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelly and I call Mr. McCallion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#K00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I will address the information on the laboratories.

Other audits like this would have shown a discordance rate of 25% to 35%, so we decided that we would plan for the worst case, which would be 40%.<\/p> <p>  We have not got all of the reports back yet, but the evidence we have suggests that the discordance rate is going to be substantially lower.

For example, our own breast screening programme has an interval cancer rate which compares very favourably internationally.  The events of last year and Dr. Scally's report showed and characterised the existing audit as flawed in design, implementation and the way in which it engaged with clinicians.  Following the publication of the Scally report, we committed to design, and are well advanced in designing, interval cancer audit for all three cancer screening programmes.  We have expert groups led by independent chairs.  We are scoping out international best practice.  For example, in Canada, all audit or quality assurance clinical activities are protected in legislation while, in England and Wales, a duty of candour legislation was introduced in 2014 making it almost unique in bringing in not only open disclosure with regard to certain elements of false negativity.<\/p> <p>  We do not want to just reintroduce what was characterised as a flawed audit.

As I said earlier, it is going to planning this week and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2021.  That is the plan in terms of the building aspect of it.  A workforce plan has been developed concerning what is needed to operate a national cervical screening laboratory.  Approval was given this year for ten posts through the funding that was mentioned earlier by colleagues in the Department and those people, including medical scientists, are being recruited.  The Coombe is working with the institutes in Dublin in terms of the training piece for medical scientists but our biggest challenge will probably involve medical consultants - the appropriate consultant cytopathologists.  There are significant challenges.  We have one permanent person and one locum person in the country.  In order to develop a laboratory, we do not just require a building, medical science and logistics.  The medical piece that provides the oversight and engages in multidisciplinary meetings with the colposcopy units for patients who are referred to colposcopy is critical.  We have sanctioned the posts and the funding so that is not an issue.  We are going through the normal consultants approval process.  That is one of the areas where we are working with our medical manpower people.  There is a national lead for medical workforce planning in the HSE and we are trying to utilise those to look at opportunities for how we could grow that.  There is a clear plan regarding how that will work but we also face a challenge that is part of the ongoing work around looking at international evidence where we need a level of resilience alongside that.  If everything is in one laboratory and there is a spike and we lose staff, the danger is that we get back into backlogs.  Difficulties can arise if there is an issue in a laboratory.  We must look at that balance.  Most jurisdictions have found some balance between having some options around resilience as well as part of it and that is also being considered.  There is a very clear timetable for the building and a workforce plan has been agreed and has started with regard to recruitment.  The Coombe, which has kindly agreed to take on this facility within the hospital, is working with the institutes to develop that and I am confident that they will address that part but there are very significant challenges involving the consultant workforce and trying to develop it.  We are looking at a range of options around how we can do that.  It goes beyond training in the sense that there is a number of people we need in the country.  If we have a small number of people and someone leaves or falls ill, we have no resilience in what we are offering so we need a significant number, which is why we have grown the number of consultant posts within the model for the national cervical screening laboratory, but there are challenges there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Have we looked at other jurisdictions such as the UK, New Zealand or Australia to see whether we have people working in that area and to try to encourage them to come back to Ireland or even to go down the road of that training?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#N00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>On the medical side, we are trying to attract qualified people.

The man in Salford in Manchester was conducting tests for nine months before there was mention of the second cytoscreener.  That is when MedLab Pathology got in contact with the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB.  INAB was not in any way aware of the Manchester laboratory until the application was received for the second employee.  Deputy Harty mentioned the number of people who worked in the laboratory.  Is there any scope for practitioners to carry out tests before they are accredited?  Could Deputy Durkan start doing tests and receive accreditation when he got round to looking for it?  My apologies to the Deputy.  That does not seem to make any sense.  For instance, in all of the contracts the State has concluded for the provision of any screening, the guidelines and precursor documents require the meeteing of the International Organisation for Standardisation, ISO, standard.  We have spoken about equivalence between the ISO standard and that of the College of American Pathologists, CAP, to which we will get back in the future.  It seems a bit handy that they are now equivalent.  If the contract for the provision of services specifically states the practitioner has to be ISO or CAP-accredited, how could there be a situation where somebody performs tests and then receives accreditation afterwards?  If a person opens a laboratory and is operational for several months before he or she receives accreditation, surely it is a breach of contract and standards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#Q00100","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Let me answer that question in a general sense.

Then, in a unique moment in INAB's history since 1985, it retrospectively, a word the delegates do not like, granted accreditation based on certain information, which I assume consisted of laboratory files, calibration documents, humidity information, etc.  As I have worked in a laboratory, I have an idea of what goes on.  When INAB's agents went there, they were able to see the files, the logs and the qualifications.  INAB is an organisation that is independent of the Department of Health and I imagine it has a European boss because the ISO standard is a European standard.  Why, for the first time ever, would it do this for a private company?  It just does not seem to add up.  Why would INAB, a group funded by the Health and Safety Authority, go back and accredit a person's work retrospectively?

How is that risk being managed?<\/p> <p>  Is Quest Diagnostics involved in HPV testing, in addition to cytology?  When doctors received results from MedLab Pathology, not only did they receive the cytology report, they also received a HPV report in conjunction with it.  Will the delegates clarify what Quest Diagnostics has been contracted to do?  What is the waiting time for samples that go to it?

It will now be the primary test or should be, while the cytology test will, I presume, be a secondary test.  That will reduce substantially the load on cytopathology.  Will it speed up the repatriation of cytological screening?<\/p> <p>  It was the audit and interval cancers that brought this controversy to the fore when it became apparent that an audit had been carried out but women had not been informed of the results.  Audit is a very important part of quality assurance.  There are two elements to the audit.  Was a misreading of a smear negligent or was it purely a built-in difficulty in screening, that it is not possible to be 100% accurate in the screening system?  Errors are inherent within screening.  The High Court judgment on absolute confidence in any cytologist looking at a smear was that if he or she had any doubt whatsoever, he or she would have to apply the absolute confidence principle.  Will it be built into any new audit process to be introduced?<\/p> <p>  To come back to Deputy Kelly's question, to which we did not receive a clear answer, when a new audit process is put in place, will it pick up from where the last audit stopped or will there be a gap in the audit process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#S02600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I will answer on one facet of the questions about the audit process and how a slide for a patient who turns out to have an interval cancer is reviewed.  To date, all of the reviews have been made in an unblinded manner.  They include the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, review where the people looking at the slide know that the patient has developed cancer.  The environment in which the review is taking place is very important.  It also depends on who a person asks.  If, for example, the slide is shown to a consultant cytologist and they are given unlimited time, in telling the doctor that the woman has cancer and asking them if they can, please, find the abnormal cells, that is an entirely different environment from that of a screener who has received many slides that day to go through and who has to pick out the abnormal cells.  None of the reviews about which we have spoken, whether they have been in court, at the RCOG or the original review, has been carried out in an unblinded manner.  It appears to us that the only fair way to do it is in a blinded manner, that a panel of individuals be included which would include a number of primary screeners, in addition to more senior ones, and that the abnormal smear be mixed in with a number of normal ones, for example, ten or 20.  There would then be an individual report from each of the people who had looked at it and an aggregate and agreed report.<\/p> <p>  The reason we believe it is so important to go into this detail is that it does not really matter how one looks at a slide if the patient is not to be told.  In many countries patients are not informed of the result of a review; therefore, the slide can be given to ten professors who will have a week to look at it for one of them to find the abnormal result.  That will have no implications if the patient is not to be told the result.  Similarly, it will have no implications if the patient is to be told and there will be no financial repercussions for the system.  In Ireland, up to now, the patient has been told and it appears as if it will have financial repercussions.  That is why it is very important to design a review system that will be entirely fair to the programme, the screener and the patient's expectations.  <\/p> <p>  That is only a small element of the questions asked by the Chairman.

Dr. Doherty might speak about HPV screening.<\/p><p> On the question on the balance between Quest Diagnostics and the Coombe, in the first quarter of this year we faced not having a cervical screening programme.  We had done a global trawl for capacity for the laboratories.  That was limited as people moved to HPV and there was little to no appetite for companies to come into this country to provide a service.  It was clear, as we have discussed earlier, that it would take a significant time, notwithstanding the effort and investment that has gone into the Coombe to build that up.  Following three months of long and protracted negotiations with the two existing providers, we managed to get an agreement.  That is the context for where we are and in terms of understanding that, it is important to note that while the Coombe did not grow, it took on much more complex work with the colposcopy smears.  Both the Coombe and Quest Diagnostics have stepped up in that regard.  Our strategies were clear, namely to build up the capacity of the Coombe, and to rebalance between public and private testing.  As I said earlier, we believe we can make some progress on that over the next number of years.  On where we can ultimately get to, we have challenges in defining a point that the Coombe can grow to but we are putting everything behind that to try to strengthen it.  On the risk with that, it is the same whether it is 90% or 10%.  The Coombe will be subject to the same quality assurance that Dr. Doherty has talked about, as will Quest Diagnostics.  As members can see, there has been one QA visit already.  An additional QA visit is planned and those are increasing in frequency from the three to five year reviews that would have been undertaken heretofore to partially restore public confidence for people and alongside the other steps that are in place within the programme.<\/p><p> I will ask Ms Fitzgerald to talk to the tracking system and the efforts to improve how information is put together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#S02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The introduction of a tracking system was part of the Dr. Scally recommendations and we have been looking at the best way to do that.

It is critical that it can be fully integrated and that we can track the samples from when they are taken by the smear taker to the conclusion.

On current HPV testing, we are a cytology-based primary screening programme.  If a woman goes for a smear, she has cytology.  She only has a HPV test if there is some abnormality on her cytology that warrants further investigation.  Where there was additional HPV testing, we have called it co-testing, which arose in the context of managing the backlog that developed in recent months, which we have now resolved.  At that time, we allowed our service providers to co-test the cytology samples for HPV to identify those which may be at a slightly higher risk and which should proceed to cytology immediately.  That happened in MedLab Pathology Limited and in Quest Diagnostics for a time.  MedLab Pathology Limited is no longer contracted to work with us and Quest Diagnostics has now resolved its backlog issues so we are back to being primarily a cytology based programme with reflex HPV where there is a need.  When we move to HPV primary screening we will turn that around where the first test will be a HPV test and those who have a positive HPV test will then proceed to have a cytology test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Doherty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I want to emphasise the accuracy of interval cancers.  They do not constitute errors <i>per se<\/i>.  All screening programmes internationally have interval cancer rates because we are dealing with a healthy population and we are applying a relatively simple and quick test to identify some of that population who are at risk of going on to develop cancer in the case of cancer screening programmes.  They are not diagnostic programmes.  For example, in our breast screening programme, for every 1,000 people screened, there are two interval cancers.  When one looks at interval cancers and breast screening programmes internationally, that breaks down to where nothing is seen, even in unblinded retrospective review, and in a small number of cases there will be something very clear in retrospective review.  As I said earlier, programmes tend to measure interval cancer rates as a measure of the quality of a programme.<br\/><br\/>On the Chairman's question on an audit, the primary purposes of an audit are learning, education and improvement.  These values are so strongly felt in many jurisdictions that the whole process of an audit is in itself protected to ensure that it can carry on unhindered so that people can learn, improve and further develop programmes.<br\/><br\/>The final question the Chairman put was on the Cross judgment and absolute confidence.  At the time there was disquiet in the screening programmes and in many other disciplines, including primary care, applying a test of absolute confidence to clinical scenarios where judgement is being used, which, as the Chairman knows, is not necessarily absolute in all clinical scenarios.  My understanding is that if that is gone, the State Claims Agency is appealing that judgment and that is proceeding in November.

I want to make it clear because Claire Healy is watching proceedings here and is extremely upset.  She was a public patient who was invited by CervicalCheck to take a test and the only difference was that it could not give her a test in a timely manner and because of her concerns she went and got a private test.  That test proved positive for precancerous cells and when she went for a colposcopy she was told they could not test her because it was a private test.  Those are the facts of the matter.  I understand the system is under pressure but let us be honest about it - the system was under pressure because of free out-of-cycle repeat smear tests that were offered by the Minister in the middle of this crisis, which put the whole system under strain.  It was a poorly thought out strategy.  For anybody who is caught up in the issue and whose case has a negative outcome, the system should be reaching out to those people.  That is why my constituent is so upset by all of this.  If this case was not highlighted publicly, it would not have been resolved.  I want to make it clear that Claire Healy was a public patient who was called in by CervicalCheck.

An issue arose in February of this year when the laboratory had taken on an additional workload for the HSE and was trying to issue results in the normal way to our IT system.  If a result comes into our IT system, the woman who has had the test is automatically notified that her GP has her result and her GP receives her result.  When the IT system in Chantilly was unable to interface with the CervicalCheck system, they used a manual system for issuing results to the GPs.  However, because the results were being issued manually, they did not come into our system electronically, and so our system did not generate letters to the women.  We wrote to GPs in April, when the manual system was finalised, to tell them they would be receiving the results manually and that they should inform their patients.  We did not write to all the women in the programme at that time because we did not know exactly who was coming or who had been screened.  We had not communicated with the women and we have learned from that.  Though we had a temporary arrangement in place and communicated with the health professionals on the issue while trying to resolve the IT glitch, we did not communicate with the women.  I take the Deputy's point.  That is a lesson for us and it has been picked up in the MacCraith report.<\/p> <p>  The IT system upgrade took longer than we expected and it affected this large group of women.  However, I can assure the committee that the IT issue has been resolved.  The results are now coming electronically into CervicalCheck and the system is working in the normal way, in that the GP gets the result and the woman gets a letter to tell her she has received her result.  We have categorised all the women who have been involved or affected in any way by this IT glitch into different groups based on the action we needed to take, and all of them have been contacted.  There is a small group of women who are working with their clinicians and whose clinicians had been in contact with them about some of the test results.  The IT issue has been resolved, the system is now functioning normally, and everybody who had been affected by this over the last number of months has had a communication from CervicalCheck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019091800002#U01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Doherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Dr. Doherty said she would follow up for me, but am I correct in saying that she has requested the circular on the decision to exclude women who had private testing, and the subsequent circular around reversing that decision?

It was only when she threatened to go to the media on 6 June that the Department of Health responded to ask for her details.  No action was taken between the beginning of April and the beginning of June regarding getting her results.  At that time, nobody was aware that there was an IT glitch, at least not in the public domain.

I appreciate this is a very long morning for the witnesses.  To return to the issue of communication with Sharon, she raised a very serious issue, which we have all now accepted.  Some did not accept that initially, but it turned out to be an incredibly serious issue.  She was fobbed off with a standard response.  I am certain she was not the only person who raised the issue with the Department.  As witnesses have said, there was a huge volume of correspondence from women who were very concerned about issues relating to their health, so concerned that they felt it necessary to escalate that.  In the normal course of things, people get a smear test done and wait for the results.  It is not unusual to wait, and generally people do not panic when they do not hear anything because they believe they will be contacted if something is wrong.  We now know that clearly that was not the case.<\/p> <p>  A large number of women raised concerns.  Did they all receive within a couple of weeks the same fob-off letter explaining the delay to them?  In reference to what the Chairman said, it does seem that only when the threat of going to the media raised its head was any sort of meaningful response given.  I am perfectly willing to accept that was not the case if the witnesses can demonstrate that to be so.<\/p> <p>  A number of women raised concerns, and so concerned were they that they raised their concerns to the level of the Minister for Health.  It appears they were being fobbed off, with the people concerned thinking it was just another letter from another woman who was just concerned because she probably read something in the newspapers or something, and they were just given a letter to explain what would happen in a generic delay-type situation.  Clearly, this was not a generic delay-type situation.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any idea how many women contacted the Department directly about this particular issue?  I hesitate to call it an IT glitch because that is very disrespectful to those on the business end of what was a complete mess.  Nobody checked if these women had legitimate concerns or if they were just part of the overall mess, for want of a better word, or part of the overall delay.  How many communications were there before a meaningful response was given?  The witnesses know what I mean by a meaningful response - not the one that explains what a delay is, because the woman was clearly living that at that time.

How serious does the volume have to be?  I fully appreciate that the Department would have been in receipt of a lot of representations, but women were making representations to the Office of the Minister for Health on the basis that they were concerned, notwithstanding the massive and unacceptable delays that meant they were already outside of that timeframe.

It does not make sense that the accreditation body would do this.  It would make sense to me if it were done all the time, because then I could say it was part of a standard approach.  The accreditation body has been in operation since 1985.  It seems that in the middle of a serious health crisis involving cervical cancer screening, it decided to tick this box for a private company, thereby deeming that in the accreditation body's expert opinion - looking back - the laboratory was competent and everything was suitable.  I do not buy it on the basis of what would happen if I operated a laboratory like this.  As a pharmacist, my understanding is that if the contract says \"ISO accreditation\", that is what we pay for and that is what we get.  My understanding was that the accreditation board, under the care of the HSA, was independent.  I am not saying it is not independent.  It is supposed to accredit.  I understood it would accredit what was in front of it, and that there would be no scope for any flexibility or generosity with regard to accreditation.  When the State signs a contract with a specific standard in it, I assume that is what we get and what the people get.  We have found out that the stuff in the US was going to Honolulu and the stuff in Sandyford was going to Manchester.  The guys who were auditing did not notice.  We do not know what these lads were doing when the quality assurance people were going over.  I am bewildered regarding what they did during the quality assurance visits.

On social housing delivery, I note from the statement provided by the Minister that more than 6,400 homes are on-site.  All present are acutely aware of the need to expedite the delivery of social housing.  Has the Minister written to local authorities about raising the discretionary cap to &euro;6 million, a measure negotiated for inclusion in budget 2019?  In my view and that of my party, that would assist local authorities to build developments of 40 to 50 houses without having to go through the five-stage process with the Department.  It was agreed to before the budget.  The last time I asked about it, I was told that it was being assessed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That did not form part of our discussions on the matter last year.  Has the Minister issued a circular to local authorities to advise them that the discretionary cap has been raised to &euro;6 million?<\/p><p>How much social housing does the Government expect to build this year?  I discussed this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and tried to tie down the number of homes we were building, rather than buying.  We are still operating in a shrunken market.  Last year 18,000 homes were built.  The State bought approximately 2,760 of them, while the investor and cuckoo funds, to which I will return, bought slightly less than 3,000.  Approximately 4,700 were one-off rural homes, most of which were not offered for sale.  That left approximately 7,000 homes available for purchase on the market in 2018 before any consideration of affordability.  The average house price in Dublin equates to approximately nine and a half times the average industrial wage, which is a big problem.  Supply is a big issue.  What is the Department's stance on purchasing homes through the Housing Agency or otherwise?  I know of quite substantial developments which the Housing Agency is seeking to purchase.  I am delighted that people are being housed, but we are in a shrunken market and competing against people who want to try to get their foot on the housing ladder.<\/p><p>Are there plans within the Department to arrest the march of cuckoo and investor funds in acquiring build-to-rent properties?  A report in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>last Sunday examined planning permissions granted for some developments.  In Walkinstown, Dublin 12, there were 757 new units, of which more than 500 were built-to-rent units.  Some 1,258 units were approved in the greater Dublin area, 965 of which are build-to-rent properties.  Of course, we need to increase the supply of rental properties, but investors are pouring into the market because of the high rents payable across the country and the tax-free treatment they receive, which is taking many prospective homes off the market.  In the area I represent it has happened in Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and Semple Woods in Donabate where family-sized homes were sold directly to real estate investment trusts, REITs by some of the larger builders such as Glenveagh Properties.  That is a big problem which needs to be tackled through planning and otherwise.  There is a role for investors in the market, but that role should be appropriate and proportionate.  They are taking over swathes of Dublin and the rest of the country, which is a serious concern.<\/p><p>The cost-effective analysis requirement which the Department has put in place for schemes worth more than &euro;20 million was previously known as cost-benefit analysis.  When local authorities submit schemes to the Department, they face the new hurdle of cost-effective analysis.  Effectively, the Department has set down a criterion for schemes worth more than &euro;20 million, whereby it asks the local authority whether the plan stacks up, which is understandable.  However, my understanding from research we have carried out is that the development of almost 2,000 homes in the Dublin city local authority area alone is being held up by the cost-effective analysis hurdle.<\/p><p>From correspondence I have seen there is a frustration with some of the local authorities that no criteria has been set down or published as to how they would meet the requirements of this cost-effective analysis.  One would think that at a time when we are trying to increase the supply of public and private housing - in this instance, it is public housing - we would actually make it easier for our local authorities to deliver and not make it more difficult.  Why is this cost-effective analysis in place and why has the Minister not seen fit to move forward with raising the discretionary cap to &euro;6 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#E00500","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions, which covered a couple of different areas.  I will start with the Deputy's first and last point around the cap and the move from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million.  To be able to raise that cap we would require a derogation from the public spending code from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We would need to seek that derogation.  I have looked at this in a lot of detail because we discussed it last year when we were talking about the budget for this year, and I believe the benefits of such a move are questionable.  We have a 59-week process now within the Department where we are working with local authorities to get housing from local authorities approved so they can get on site to start building.  Raising the threshold from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million would perhaps save six to eight weeks.  Six to eight weeks is not nothing but in return for that time saving we would lose oversight of some 44% of the capital spend on housing nationally.  Obviously there are risks in that when we consider the loss of oversight and the uncertainty around value for money.  There is also the more worrying problem that when the projects come to us for final approval, which they would have to, if they had made mistakes along the way, we would not have seen them.  At that point we might have to refuse, which would mean projects would have to go right back to the start.  Local authority projects have been brought forward previously where the individual home to be built might be at a cost of &euro;750,000 based on how they inspect it.  In that kind of a situation, if we had not been keeping an eye through each of the stages we would be telling them to go right back to the beginning.  That would mean the shortened six to eight weeks timeline would need to go right back to the beginning again.  We have examined this and it would require a derogation from the public spending code from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Based on that kind of information, and I can give the Deputy further detail on it, I am not sure that either Department will be recommending going forward with that.  The benefits versus the risks are questionable.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the build out this year, what we will build and will tear out lease and acquisition from that.  The target is at least 6,200.  I did a review with local authorities in the summer and have had a number of engagements on this.  I will meet with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, again tomorrow.  So far our targets are looking good with regard to the pure build number.  The Deputy referred to the Housing Agency and acquisitions.  The Housing Agency is leading on acquisitions from bank-led vacancies.  These are homes that are vacant because the banks have them vacant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#F00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>The agency is buying whole estates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#F00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>The Housing Agency has a mandate to lead on bank-led vacancies and that is what it is doing.

These institutional investors are now captured by rent controls for the new stock they are bringing on line and if one is a tenant it does not matter if the landlord is a once-off investor or somebody who owns a number of properties.  This is also important.  We need to find the right balance in the sector so that we are not losing landlords from the market and so tenants are not exposed to the volatility we have had previously due to an over reliance on individual landlords.  We also need to make sure that this type of finance is not crowding out the kind of finance that builds homes for people to buy for themselves.  This is why we are keeping an eye on things, to make sure we do not tilt in a negative way.<\/p> <p>  The cost-effectiveness analysis is for projects estimated to cost over &euro;20 million.  I understand the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently reviewing this.  We have 22,000 homes in the pipeline with the Department, with more than 6,000 homes currently under construction on sites up and down the country.  There are no unnecessary delays with regard to what is happening in the Department.  We constantly look to streamline things.  Provided today are the new specifications for internal guidelines for layouts of social housing homes schemes and for the type of fit out.  The purpose of finalising and providing those is that local authorities can take standard layouts and designs off the shelf.  These are not done for the exterior layouts and designs because the exterior design needs to be sympathetic to the receiving area and we do not want social housing to look the same throughout the country.  If we can provide 25 to 30 different types of design and specifications for internal layouts, it will be good and will help to cut timelines.  There is also a proposal from the CCMA on restructuring the housing delivery office, on which I will hear more tomorrow.  These are further reforms that will improve timelines for delivering social housing.  There are big numbers this year: 10,000 in the stock for social housing, the majority of which will be built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#F00800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I have one final point.

It relates to the #sexisnotrent question raised in the D&aacute;il earlier today by Deputy Coppinger.  Deputy Coppinger and I met with the woman in question, and I will talk about this in a moment.  First I will ask the Minister four questions.  Does the Minister accept the housing crisis seriously increases the vulnerability of women in such situations?  What steps does the Minister propose to take to ensure that people in such a situation are safe to speak out without fear of eviction?  What steps does the Minister propose to take to gauge the prevalence of this problem in society in this State?  I am getting messages as I speak to indicate that our office and Deputy Coppinger's office have been contacted by many people in the last two hours who are housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants.  We are now contacting these people to get exact details, but it seems that some landlords who interview people for HAP tenancies are raising the idea of sexual favours if the person gets the nod for the tenancy.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this, and if it is the case, what action might be taken.  I met recently with the woman concerned in this case, with Deputy Coppinger-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#F01100","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I am sure Deputy Barry is aware, but I feel obliged to say that he should make sure not to name any individual in his important contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#F01200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I have the correspondence here.  It is clear who the correspondence is from, but I will not name any names at the committee today.  I recently met the woman, along with Deputy Coppinger.  She is a young woman who is working.  The idea of having a place on her own was a real difficulty because of the high cost of rent.  She had been sharing accommodation with a friend.  There is a direct connection between the housing crisis being experienced by this country under the Government.<\/p><p>The friend decided to leave the accommodation for her own reasons as she was moving on with her life, and so the woman in question was facing the threat of homelessness.  Once again, the housing crisis we are experiencing under this Minister and  Government was a factor here.  The landlord then found himself in a position of power over this young woman and some of the texts containing these suggestions were sent only a matter of days before she had to leave the premises.  Three offers were made to this woman by the landlord, who she estimates to be in his mid-60s.  One offer was to solve her problem by going to live with him.  Another option was to go for dinner with him, see what happens and continue to pay rent at the same rate, which would be half the rent on the property.  He also suggested that if things went the right way, the rent could be free.  It is estimated that there are 250,000 cases of this type in Britain and I think there must be many cases in this country too.  This could be a #MeToo moment for the housing crisis and while I have asked questions of the Minister on this, I also appeal to people generally and encourage them to speak out about this issue.  I would be stunned if this was the only case.  I know it is not the only case.  Now is the time for people who have had this horrible experience to speak out in order that we can lift the lid on one of the uglier and murkier aspects of the housing crisis under this Government.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#F01300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I addressed this issue in the D&aacute;il earlier today.  If what the Deputy is alleging happened, it is illegal and a matter for the Garda.  I have already attempted to make contact with Deputy Coppinger to get information about the case.  My office is also contacting the Department of Justice and Equality to see how we might compile statistics or evidence in this area.  As with any other issue, it is important to get the best information possible in order to know what policy responses might be needed.  Such responses would not relate only to housing and would not fall to just this part of the Government because this is a wider criminal issue.  A number of people are vulnerable because of the housing crisis.  There is a housing shortage, which we are trying to address.  People find themselves in incredibly difficult circumstances because of that.  The case the Deputy has outlined is one example but there are also issues around families having to go into emergency accommodation or people being housed in substandard and dangerous accommodation.  That is why we have brought forward rent reforms and are building tens of thousands more homes than we were previously.  It is also why we have put better emergency supports in place for people who find themselves vulnerable at this time of crisis.<\/p> <p>  I would caution the Deputy on linking this allegation to something specific like the housing assistance payment, HAP, just because he received a few phone calls on the issue.  HAP is working successfully for tens of thousands of people and if the payment were not in place, those people would be even more vulnerable because of the housing shortage.  Comments from colleagues in the Deputy's party have served to undermine that support.  HAP helps people so let us be very careful about the comments we make around this sensitive issue.  Let us also ensure the help we are trying to give everyone suffering as a result of the housing crisis is directed in the best way possible to actually help them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#G00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":527,"content":"<p>How much time do I have left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#G00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>The Deputy will have time in the follow-up round.

I place on record my appreciation and thanks to the Minister's team in the Custom House.  I have found them to be exceptionally helpful and supportive whenever I have requested information on Rebuilding Ireland.  Much of our work can be done in that way, which works well for me.  I just want to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Deputy Rock on his appointment as Chairman and wish him well.  I also extend my best wishes to Deputy Bailey who served this committee with distinction.  The Chairman has big shoes to fill, as the Minister said, and I want to wish Deputy Bailey well.  She contributed greatly to this work and that is important.  I have no doubt she will have a continuing role in relation to housing.<\/p> <p>  I have had a look at the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  As I indicated to the Minister's predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, it contains 168 key actions in five pillars.  It was a brave and courageous move for a Minister and Government to set down all those tasks because once one starts setting down tasks in a format like this, one always has to deliver them and account for them.  I do not think the Minister or his team has any difficulty with that, and much has been achieved.  When we look back at this original document, we have to acknowledge where we have come from and where we are now.  Much of the work involved putting down strong foundations and getting things done but there is much more to be done.<\/p> <p>  I have about 12 questions and I intend being simple and to the point.  I will tee off the reference points for these questions in the Rebuilding Ireland status report.  Actions 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 all relate to Tusla.  I have serious concerns about the safety protocols there.  We all need to feel safe wherever we live and we also need to feel safe and secure, particularly in emergency accommodation.  Without commenting on a particular case currently before the courts, there was a description in the papers yesterday of emergency accommodation that was \"chaotic\", \"unsuitable\" and \"unsafe\".  That is the allegation, which must be a worry for anyone involved in housing.  People are vulnerable, as the Minister said.  People feel isolated and vulnerable when they are homeless and they need our help.  We all accept that but it is important to state it.<\/p> <p>  I will make a few requests of the Minister.  We should review and examine the protocols in relation to Stay Safe and child protection.  Every local authority should be reissued guidelines on what to look out for and what the statutory obligations on child protection are.  This is really important.  I ask the Minister to request a review and that a protocol and circular be issued to all housing authorities and people dealing with housing in relation to this matter.<\/p> <p>  It is time that we look again at action 1.7, which refers to a renewed focus on people living in institutional and State care.  They are particularly vulnerable and we know from our research and work on the ground that many of them end up homeless after leaving care.  We need to look at this objective again.<\/p> <p>  The HAP place finder services are working exceptionally well and we need more of them.  I would like to look again at providing additional people and resources for local authorities and HAP.  I know one or two local authorities said they did not want those resources but we need to look at the ones that do because it is a good system.<\/p> <p>  Action 1.35 deals with non-Irish nationals without residency entitlements, which is a particular area of vulnerability for people who need safe housing like anybody else.  I ask that we look at that again to ensure we are picking up on all the issues and fulfilling our commitments on it.  This is a group of people that needs to be supported and cared for as much as anybody else would be in this country.  I ask the Minister to look into that.<\/p> <p>  Could the Chairman flag my time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#G00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":530,"content":"<p>The Senator has one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#G00600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I note that the Minister says he is currently gathering up the social outputs for local authorities for quarter 2, and that they are on their way.

I refer to the points he raised about Tusla.  When the Ombudsman for Children released his report, perhaps three months ago, I met him and we talked through the different recommendations in the report.  We discussed the need to ensure all necessary care and supports are being put in place, including by agencies that do not report directly to me, of which Tusla is one.  We needed to make sure there is a line of sight between the people providing the care and the parent Departments in order that the right procedures and protocols were being followed.<\/p><p>We had a conversation around that.  One of the important outcomes of the work we have been doing with the NGOs is the quality standards framework.  We had it as a pilot project but it has now been rolled out nationally, which is important.<br\/><br\/>Regarding private operators, a number of whom I have visited in the last couple of months because I wanted to look into it in more detail, everybody working in the these facilities are Garda vetted and trained in child protection and there is other mandatory training to take place also.  We are in continued engagement with the ombudsperosn on things we want to do around standards, inspection, care and safety for people in emergency accommodation.<br\/><br\/>On institutional care, the Senator is correct.  One of the things I remember addressing initially when I came into the Department was where people leave hospital or prison, for example, and do not have a home or accommodation sorted, ensuring arrangements in place.  It has been happening between some NGOs and hospitals, for example, on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, but through the interagency group I established in September of 2017, we are trying to put in place more formal engagements in that regard.  Some things are moving well on the health side, for example.  There will be some new facilities coming on board and the health side has made a commitment to support these facilities if we support the capital contribution to get them open.  Where people might be in long-term institutional care, we must ensure it is the right kind of care and they are not just seen as being in emergency accommodation.  They will not be able to maintain an independent tenancy on their own and will need these long-term supports and we must ensure these are in place for them. <br\/><br\/>On the Place Finders service, it is proving successful.  They were new when I came into office.  We have offered Place Finders to every local authority.  Most importantly in the Dublin area, we recruited 15 new staff members to the Place Finders service who will be starting work in the coming weeks.  I spoke to Dublin City Council about that earlier in the week and I am sure they will do much the good work there.<br\/><br\/>On the question of non-nationals and those who do not have rights, it is important for the public to understand that where outreach teams go out at night to people sleeping rough, they do not ask any questions about people's rights.  Their immediate concern is to get them into safe care.  I saw that happen quite dramatically at the time of Storm Emma, where many people who were squatting or otherwise were brought into the system.  It is then a question of trying to get them through the system in the most effective way possible for them.  We had a protocol agreed with the Department of Justice and Equality.  That was one of the outcomes of the interagency group, that is, to have a person in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, to help with these types of issues.  There is a protocol now in place for the sharing of information, which is important.<br\/><br\/>It is also is important to ensure emergency accommodation is emergency accommodation and not a substitute for direct provision or other care and supports needed by people who do not have rights, or are in the process of establishing their rights, or who are fleeing persecution or seeking asylum.  It is about getting the right kind of care and support.  To be honest, people in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and other local authorities are not trained in those types of supports.  It is important we keep those two things separate, notwithstanding the fact that, immediately, whenever we come across an individual who needs help, he or she gets that help, regardless of his or her status and rights.  The most important thing is to treat people with compassion and care.<br\/><br\/>On social house building and the numbers for the first and second quarters, 2,537 was the increase in the stock of social housing in the first half of this year.  Like in other years, the programme ramps up in the third and fourth quarters.  That speaks to the question the Senator asked about the financial drawdown so far from the Department in that we always see it, and, from memory, we have never underspent on our capital side.  We always get there or thereabouts towards the end of the year.  In fact, I had to seek additional funding towards the end of last year because we were doing better than expected in the supports we provided in the course of last year.  That is not an option open to me given the financial considerations that we are all aware of and that are on the way because we are planning for no-deal Brexit.  We will be spending our budget in full this year and will be delivering the supports that we said we would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#G00800","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I have three questions in this round and will come back to the other pillars in the second round.<\/p><p>I want to pick up on the Minister's exchange with Deputy Darragh O'Brien on the speeding up of social housing delivery and this issue of whether the Government was going to raise the threshold for local authorities to use the one track or one stage planning process.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in his contribution on the budget last October, made it very clear that an agreement had been reached with Fine Gael that the one stage process threshold would be increased to &euro;6 million.  He stated: <\/p><blockquote>We secured agreement to reduce the four stages of planning applications from local authorities to the Department to one stage, we also removed the ceiling of &euro;2 million that requires Authorities to apply for even very small developments. The ceiling is now increased three-fold to &euro;6 million.<\/blockquote> <p>Members will remember there was a very heated exchange at the last committee meeting where Deputy O'Brien claimed that was agreed and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, took a different view to say it was agreed to examine it, but that was subjected to a consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If I am not mistaken, this is the first time the Minister has publicly stated, or certainly to this committee, that on foot of that advice from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, he does not believe it is appropriate to raise the threshold from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million.  Can the Minister just confirm that is correct and that it is not the Government's intention, irrespective of other parties may claim was agreed in last year's budget negotiations, and that the threshold is not going to be increased?  Therefore, local authorities, like those in Dublin, for example, which do not do social building projects for &euro;2 million, will not be able to avail of the fast-track one-stage process.<\/p><p>My next question is on homelessness.  The latest homeless figures were produced, as the Minister is aware, a couple of weeks ago.  In the last 12 months, adult homelessness is up as is child homelessness.  The percentage of individuals and families in emergency accommodation and the length of time they are spending in emergency accommodation have increased.  Crucially, we are spending more on private emergency accommodation than ever before.  We have more individuals, families and children in private emergency accommodation, and it is costing the State, the taxpayer, about &euro;2 million a week for hotels, bed and breakfasts, etc.  In Dublin, it is about &euro;1.5 million a week and outside of Dublin, it is &euro;0.5 million.  Does the Minister not accept at this stage, given all those facts, and notwithstanding the fact there have been some positive outcomes on prevention, that what he is doing simply is not working and the problem is getting worse?  What is he going to do in the coming months that is different and that we do not end up having the same conversation that we have every quarter, when the numbers are going in the wrong direction?  I am not arguing that he should not be spending on emergency accommodation but it is about the relentless rise in homelessness.<\/p><p>On affordability, in our first of these meetings at the start of this year, I asked if the Minister would confirm that no affordable homes to rent or buy would be delivered in 2019 under any Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government funded scheme, be it costs-rental or affordable purchase?  At that stage, the Minister declined to answer and said he would answer it later on in the year.  Given that none has been delivered, will the Minister confirm none will be delivered for the remainder of this year?<\/p><p>The Minister said something interesting during Oral Questions in the D&aacute;il earlier today.  He said the delivery date, in terms of when tenants were likely to move into the affordable cost-rental properties in Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, is 2021.  Given that these are the first of the affordable housing projects to be funded by his Department, can he confirm that no affordable properties to rent or to buy under schemes funded by his Department will be delivered at next year?<\/p><p>Related to that, many of us have huge concerns about what the Minister considers to be affordability.  Enniskerry Road, as we know, is about &euro;1,200 rent a month.  That is not affordable for the vast majority of households that need it.  We now have three sets of figures from Dublin City Council on the potential purchase price of the so-called affordable homes in O'Devaney Gardens.  There was a report by the manager early last week and additional information was given by the manager to elected members this week and the Minister made comments today.  The figures range from the high end of &euro;420,000 for an affordable home to &euro;399,000 for an affordable home.  During Oral Questions in the D&aacute;il today, the Minister said most would be delivered below &euro;310,000.  Even &euro;310,000, of course, is not affordable because the average loan offered by Dublin City Council in the Rebuilding Ireland home loan is less than &euro;200,000.<\/p><p>My concern is that we are not getting delivery of units and even the units that the Minister is promising us are not going to be affordable.  What are the Minister's thoughts on all that?  Crucially, given that the affordable housing to rent or buy is for those households above the social housing eligibility threshold, which is &euro;38,000 for a family with several children in Dublin, and up to &euro;75,000, the only way we can meet their needs to rent or buy is if we have rents at &euro;700 to &euro;900, and houses to purchase at less than &euro;250,000.  Does the Minister accept those points?  Will he respond to what Mr. Brendan Kenny said when he was here the last time?  He said that to deliver homes at those prices, he needs an additional intervention from Government, either longer maturities on the loans funding, for example, St. Michael's estate or greater capital investment at the start.  How are we going to deliver genuinely affordable rental and purchase homes, not homes at &euro;1,200 or &euro;310,000 up to nearly &euro;500,000, which is currently the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#H00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":535,"content":"<p>To respond to the question on the potential increase of between &euro;2 million and &euro;6 million on the one-stage and the four-stage in the social housing approval process, I cannot confirm anything because I have not had an opportunity to consult the Department of Finance on the need for a derogation and whether such a derogation would be forthcoming.  As we made clear as a Government at the time, most projects coming before the Department could come in under the one-stage approval process and did not need to go through the four stages.  There was a question as to how necessary a derogation was but we agreed to review and change the threshold if it was seen to be justified.  On foot of the review and taking a look at the projects coming through, the speed at which they are being completed, new innovations we are bringing forward to cut the timelines, some of the projects that have come to us from local authorities, which are not proper projects and have to be set back, losing time, and the risk is that might increase, my fear is that it would be reckless to change the threshold, although I have not had a chance to discuss the matter in detail with the Department of Finance because other conversations are ongoing given the time of year.  I want to have that conversation with the Department before we come to a conclusion but I was clear with Deputy O'Brien in our previous engagement at the committee as to what my understanding was from those engagements around this time last year.<\/p> <p>  On the question about homelessness, the Deputy outlined a number of facts about what is happening with the homelessness issue.  We cannot and should not pretend we do not have a massive challenge and that it will continue to be a challenge in the future.  From the experts in the local authorities, on the front line and in some of the leading non-governmental organisations, we have learned that the problem has stabilised.  We continue to have a serious challenge because it is still true there is net immigration and not enough homes are being built.  We will continue to have to deal with the challenge but part of the reason I am trying to improve the details and data we have is to enable a national understanding of what is happening.  Some 1,400 people exited homelessness in the second quarter of this year, which was a 21% increase on the previous year, while some 2,800 exited in the first half of the year, an increase of more than 20% on the same period last year.  Some 532 of the exits into social housing equated to a 52% increase, meaning that more people are entering social housing than are entering the private rented sector from emergency accommodation or homelessness, which shows that new homes we are producing and providing for social housing are helping people who are experience housing insecurity.<\/p> <p>  Presentations in Dublin have fallen, as has the number of people entering emergency accommodation in Dublin.  In the first half of this year, for every two families who presented we found a home for one immediately.  Even though there have been continuing presentations of families and individuals in their thousands over the course of the past year, fewer families and children are in emergency accommodation than there were a year ago, which speaks to the considerable work being done by everyone working on the front line with us.  It continues to be a significant challenge, however, and we will continue to have to allocate resources to it.  Given that more than 2,000 homes begin construction on site every month, as is happening, and given there is a commitment and money to deliver approximately 10,000 new homes to the stock of social housing this year, we will make serious in-roads and continue to help thousands of people either exit emergency accommodation or escape the housing insecurity that has made them present as homeless in the first place.<\/p> <p>  On affordability, prices have fallen for a while.  There was double-digit growth throughout 2018, but that has fallen to low single-digit growth nationally while in areas of Dublin it is falling.  To put that in perspective, a total of 88% of first-time buyers buy their home for less than &euro;250,000 outside the greater Dublin area, Cork and Galway.  For first-time buyers in those areas, one in two buys a home for less than &euro;320,000.  Two people earning the average industrial wage can afford to buy a house and secure a mortgage from a bank, not from a local authority, and buy a home at that price point.  In Dublin, a total of 40% buy their home for &euro;320,000 or less, which tells the story of the affordability challenge we face.  It is not nationwide but it is quite acute in certain areas.  That prices are falling in parts of Dublin is welcome but it is not true to say we have not delivered any affordable homes under affordability schemes.<\/p> <p>  Measures such as the &Oacute; Cualann model are possible only because they have been taken by Dublin City Council and the other local authorities.  Homes with the LIHAF cost reduction are already on sale.  In 2020, affordable homes will be completed as per the timelines presented to me by the various stakeholders bringing the projects forward.  I believe that the site under construction in Enniskerry Road, a two-bedroom apartment at &euro;1,200, will be affordable, at &euro;600 for each person paying the rent.  It was not easy to get there, however.  The Housing Agency, the National Development Finance Agency, Tuath Housing, Respond, my Department, the European Investment Bank, and the Housing Finance Agency - a number of actors - were involved to try to get us to a place where we could provide those types of affordable rents.  Let us not forget what we are doing in respect of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which received a significant increase in funding following the engagements I had with the Minister for Finance, and the help-to-buy scheme, which has helped more than 12,000 people to get a home.<\/p> <p>  On the report on O'Devaney Gardens, I spoke to Dublin City Council about the matter.  Four homes will cost &euro;420,000 but Dublin City Council informed me that it will re-examine the matter and that no homes will cost more than &euro;400,000.  Notwithstanding that, the majority of the homes will cost less than &euro;310,000, which, as I noted, is affordable for people earning the average industrial wage.  In the case of other Dublin sites, such as in Ballyfermot and Ballymun, using the serviced sites fund there will be homes for less than &euro;200,000.  We will use land to continue to increase affordability and bring forward such schemes.  The purpose of the Land Development Agency is to bring forward affordable housing but that is not just the mandate of the agency but rather of the whole Government.  In any Department or State agency where development is under way for housing, 30% must be secured for affordable housing, which has a deflationary impact on land prices more generally and will help push down prices.<\/p> <p>  I continue to keep issues under review in respect of affordable building and delivery.  We continue to consult people working in the sector and hear their proposals to lock more affordability into what is happening in the housing sector.  As I have always stated clearly, the old ways of thinking, namely, that if we build enough social housing homes, it will bring about affordable housing, has not worked in other cities.  The Government has to step in to bridge the affordability gap, which is precisely what we are doing with our various initiatives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#J00100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":536,"content":"<p>On the homelessness figures, I appreciate the level of work being done to reduce the level of homelessness but, regrettably, the numbers continue to increase.  While we all accept that 2,825 people either have been prevented from entering homelessness or have exited homelessness, in the past six months some 129 people per week have presented as homeless, or 18 people per day.  The figures are still increasing, therefore, and we have not got on top of the matter.  The Minister stated 2,825 is a 21% increase.  Where do we need to reach for the figures to decrease realistically?  There has been a decrease for two months but this month there has again been a further increase.  The Minister stated previously, including well over a year ago, that we need to collect better data but when do we stop collecting data and make decisions?  What better data do we need to make decisions?<\/p> <p>  The Minister also mentioned the monthly reporting of homelessness.  He suggested there is a better format and that he would prefer the figures to be reported every three months.  Nothing is stopping him from publishing a quarterly homelessness report if he can gather additional data.  What information will be gathered for a three-month homelessness report as opposed to that gathered for the monthly homelessness report which is currently presented?  If it can be done, why is the Minister not doing it?  He does not need the approval of the committee to publish a quarterly report.  <\/p> <p>  On rapid building, we all know that \"rapid\" was probably the wrong word to use.  When the scheme was announced, there was a perception the homes might be poor quality, although I believe we have now dismissed that and people accept that rapid-build houses are well-built houses.<\/p><p>We are so far off target on this, however, that it is frightening.  Perhaps the Minister can give us an update on the rapid-build programme.  Moving through the rapid-build programme, I will move to the delivery of the volumetric rapid-build delivery.  Perhaps the Minister can give an update on exactly where that design process is, as it was meant to be here in quarter one but it is not here in quarter two.<\/p><p> One other item that has not been addressed yet is the Home Building Finance Ireland fund of &euro;750 million.  This is of interest to me because I have spoken to a lot of smaller developers from outside of Dublin who have found it exceptionally hard to access funding.  I see there has been some success in this regard and while I know it is early in the play, can the Minister get us some detailed reports on the type of applications that are being presented, where they are from, why some are getting approved and others are not?  That would give us a better understanding of how that scheme is working because it could be positive.<\/p><p> We all share the frustration regarding vacant properties.  We have not delivered on the potential of what vacant properties could have done in solving our housing crisis.  We asked each local authority to set up a vacant property office.  Is it delivering or what else can be done to try to get all these vacant properties back into use?  They are visible to all of us but we have failed to get them back into use and it is part of the solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#J00200","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  On homelessness, a lot of the inquiries we are seeing are being driven by individuals and the complexities we have there.  We are moving to increase the number of additional emergency accommodation places we have for individuals because it is important to do that.  What we saw for two months in a row was a decrease in the overall numbers but for three months before that we were seeing the numbers of families and children in homelessness falling.  It could be the case that the numbers for August might be up again.  Looking back - and I have looked back over previous years - we have traditionally seen high numbers for homelessness in June, July and August.  We did not see them in June this year but we saw them in July and it might have carried through into August.  I am engaging with the local authorities to get a better understanding of what has happened over the course of August.  The increases we are seeing have been met by increases in exits and in preventions, and that is the important thing.  We are doing a huge amount of work and if that work was not being done, a lot more people would find themselves in crisis.  For example, if we were not using types of supports such as the housing assistance payment, the homeless housing assistance payment, the place finder programme, paying the deposit and the first month's rent, things would be a lot worse.  The same goes for the increase in the social housing stock and that is why it is so important that we are doing that.<\/p><p>I have produced the first quarterly report.  What I said previously was that we would continue to publish monthly and we would start reporting quarterly to give that greater level of detail in order that we could understand what was happening with presentations, preventions, exits, length of time in emergency accommodation and to where people are exiting.  That is why we know there has been a more than 50% increase in the number of exits into social housing homes rather than into the private sector.  That is why we know the majority of people currently in emergency accommodation in Dublin are spending less than 12 months in emergency accommodation.<\/p><p>I have been doing a bit of reading and research into efforts to tackle homelessness in other parts of the world and one of the first things any expert will say is that without good data, it will not be possible to get on top of the underlying causes and then bring about the necessary policy responses.  That is why we are continuing to build up our data.  We have a separate independent research project under way that is tracking a piece of work on families in emergency accommodation that I hope will help better inform our data and the work we are trying to do.  The monthly numbers are important but I have always said we need to get behind the numbers to the people and to the problems and that is how we figure out and tailor better solutions.  It is also how we can make sure we get to a point where we believe we have stabilised what is happening in homelessness and to get people out of long-term emergency accommodation.  We must make sure that as we build social housing homes, as we increase housing more generally and as we see more landlords returning to the rental sector, it results in a continuing decrease in the numbers of people in emergency accommodation.  However, we continue to see people presenting, individual adults in particular.  That is a cause of concern but we continue to increase the number of preventions and exits, which is also important.<\/p><p>On rapid-build, &quot;rapid&quot; is an unfortunate word to use  The fact of the matter is that it is quick, once planning and procurement have been gone through.  We try to shortcut those other processes as much as we can.  The fast-track planning process has been done in my Department.  There are perceptions around quality, which are unfortunate, but they have largely been dealt with.  We have a new framework.  Some 150 homes are coming off the new framework on two sites in the next couple of weeks and that provides for 1,200 more homes.  What we are seeing with local authorities - and it is part of the engagement I have with the CCMA tomorrow - is that where there are parts of the local authority sector with better expertise on rapid, modular, off-site or prefabricated builds, they are coming to the fore and helping other local authorities that do not have that.  It is part of the shared services model we have been building more generally in the housing sector as we upskill the local authorities to build more homes.<\/p><p>On Home Building Finance Ireland, while that is not directly under my Department, the note I have here says there have been 30 applications to date with &euro;41 million of funding approved for 228 homes on seven sites.  Some 92% of those are outside of Dublin.  The Department of Finance will report on what it is doing at regular intervals but I know from my direct engagements with HBFI what it has been able to do in a number of instances.  Having been approached, HBFI, by working on the borrower's application, is enabling that person to then go to the existing banks and get finance that way.  That was a point that came up in a recent engagement I had with the Irish Home Builders Association.  That was probably about six weeks ago.  We had HBFI in the room, as well as Irish Water and others, to go through different challenges the sector was experiencing and we got a good update from the representative from HBFI.  A report should be published soon on what it has done to date but those are some of the top-line figures from the Department.<\/p><p>On vacant officer teams, from memory, since Rebuilding Ireland commenced, somewhere in the region of 7,000 to 9,000 homes have come out of long-term vacancy and back into the stock of housing.  We have vacant home plans for every local authority and I approved funding for vacancy officers for every local authority.  Through that work, I have an individual breakdown of what is happening in each local authority area.  What I have been saying to colleagues, to Deputies and to Senators - and I have spoken on this a number of times in the Seanad - is that I have spoken on particular local authorities and given that drill-down of information.  I have pointed out what the Central Statistics Office, CSO, said, I have pointed out what the geodata said, I have pointed out what our own surveys said, I have listed the inspections that have happened, I have given the up-to-date numbers and I have detailed the compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, that are in train.  That is the level of detail I have given and I can provide that to members on request if they want to do it by way of a parliamentary question, in a Topical Issue matter or in a Commencement matter because it is a good way of getting the information out.  There has been a revamp to the website.  That will be launched tomorrow by the Minister of State, Deputy English.  We have had thousands of people provide information on vacancy in their areas.  That goes through Mayo County Council as the lead local authority and then goes through the separate local authority areas from there.  It will be announcing some interesting numbers on that tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#K00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I call Senator Kelleher and I welcome her to the committee again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#K00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

How many in direct provision centres, including children, have residency status but are unable to leave because of the housing shortage?<\/p><p> The report, No Place like Home, by the Ombudsman for Children and the report of the Children's Rights Alliance, Home Works, highlight the negative impact of living in emergency accommodation on children, not just for the present but for their futures too.  A ten year old girl compared the family hub accommodation in she was living to a prison because that had been her experience.  It leaves children at risk of developing adverse childhood experiences, something that has been well documented as a phenomenon.  The research shows the long-term impact of homelessness on children's health and well-being, including an increased likelihood of homelessness in later life.  Is the Department, or any other, carrying out any assessment of the long-term impact on children of living in emergency accommodation?  Would the Minister consider placing a time limit on how long a child can spend in emergency accommodation?<\/p><p> The first key action in pillar 1 of Rebuilding Ireland was to ensure that by mid-2017, that is, two years ago, commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation would only be used in limited circumstances to provide emergency accommodation, in recognition of the fact that staying in such accommodation was inappropriate and unsustainable over a long period and particularly detrimental to children.  As of 1 June 2019, 80 homeless families were in one-night-only emergency accommodation.  Why has the commitment to cease the reliance on commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation not been delivered on?  What steps are being taken to ensure no families will be subject to what is a chronically unstable and inappropriate provision?  Will the Minister consider a change in the law in order that decision makers will have to consider what is the best for each child and ensure his or her needs are met when deciding where to accommodate families?<\/p><p> Serious concerns were expressed about housing in the budget submission of Cork Chamber of Commerce, which represents 1,200 businesses.  The chamber's latest survey of its members reveals issues related to the availability of rental accommodation as being the top threat to growth, second only to Brexit.  The report states that while housing provision is a social issue, insufficient housing stock, particularly rental accommodation, remains a primary concern that has a negative impact on the ability of businesses to grow and hire and retain talent.  It also contributes to wage inflation, thus impacting on competitiveness.  I ask the Minister for his comments on the short, medium-and long-term impact on children of living in emergency accommodation.  They number almost 4,000 according to his own figures.  I also ask him to comment on the lack of a good rental sector in the context of our future prosperity, as Cork Chamber of Commerce has flagged in successive budget submissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#K00800","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>There are 1,005 families headed by a single parent in emergency accommodation.  We tried to do a piece of research into the reasons people were presenting as homeless and at emergency accommodation centres, but 40% of respondents did not give a reason.  We tried to get a proper understanding of what was going on from the answers of the other 60%.  Family breakdown accounted for one in three cases, although we did not have a further breakdown of what family breakdown meant, or know how many cases involved domestic violence.  One in three came from the private rental sector, although not necessarily following an eviction.  In fact, we did not know what the reasons were.  This shows the lack of detail included in the data.  We have commissioned a more detailed survey which is under way.  I hope, we will get a much better understanding from it of the reasons people present as homeless.<\/p> <p>  I am not responsible for the direct provision system.  Different supports are in place for peope coming into the country and seeking asylum.  It is not done by local authorities but is led by the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>  I am very well aware of the negative impact on children.  One of the first things brought to my attention was the presentation of children suffering from motor skill development issues because of the cramped places in which they were being brought up.  I have spoken to people who work in the hubs and have dealt with the issue of homelessness for far longer than I have.  I have heard about their fear of intergenerational homelessness and situations where a child is more at risk of becoming homeless than adults.  I have also spoken to teachers about the impact of homelessness and living on emergency accommodation on children.  The hub programme is in response to the fact that we believe hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation are not an appropriate first response for families.  There are 650 families in family hubs where they receive all the care and support they need.  Families in hubs spend much less time in emergency accommodation than families in hotels.  In Dublin the majority of families spend less than 12 months in emergency accommodation before they are given a home.  That is still too long, but the stay is much longer for families in hotels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#L00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Hubs are not homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#L00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>They are not homes but a first response.  In the first half of this year 467 families left emergency accommodation and moved into homes, an increase of 45% on the number in 2018.  While things are very bad and we face a huge challenge, we are increasing the supports and getting more families and children out of emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  On the question about the position in Cork, we need more rental properties in this country.  I am awaiting the latest rental sector data for the second quarter from the RTB's rent index.  They will be available in the next couple of weeks, but the data for quarter 1 show that there increases in the numbers of landlords and tenancies.  That is good because, for a long time, they were decreasing, putting greater pressure on emergency accommodation.  With fewer landlords and fewer places to rent, there is greater housing insecurity.  Perhaps it is turning back in the other direction and the quarter 2 data will give us more information in that regard.  There is a need for more rental  properties in Cork, but they will not come from individual landlords in bringing one or two to the market.  They will only come in building more apartments.  That requires build-to-rent apartments and institutional investment.  As I discussed with Deputy Darragh O'Brien, we need to ensure this will continue to happen but not in a way that will unbalance the market.  As of now, 10,000 of 350,000 rental properties are with institutional investors.  The number is increasing and we are keeping the position under review.  I have met representatives from Cork to discuss the challenges in building apartments that people can afford to buy or rent.  Based on suggestions they made to me, the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste who is a representative for Cork, we are reviewing some of the proposals to see if we can help expedite the delivery of apartments.  In the latest report we have seen an increase of 150% in the number of planning permissions.  The number of planning permissions for apartments now exceeds that for homes by a ratio of 5:1.  If this follows through to commencements and completions, it will do a lot of the heavy lifting to help those in the rental sector and those looking to buy their own home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#L00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment.

His experience will be very useful in helping the committee to chart where it wants to go in what remains of the term of this Oireachtas.  I also join colleagues in commending his predecessor, Deputy Bailey, on the work she did.<\/p><p>As an aside, I welcome Senator Kelleher to the committee, as I know her commitment to this particular area, equality of access to housing for all, irrespective of their communities and whether people are in a minority.  She will play a significant role in the work of this committee.<\/p><p> I welcome the Minister.  We have had engagements over a period about how some local authorities have been more compliant with national policy than others.  I know that to try to focus minds, a twice-yearly conference has been organised to bring those authorities together and to challenge them to meet their targets and so on.  What is the Minister's view on their targets?  Are the departmental data indicating that matters have improved in respect of local authorities meeting their targets in the various areas?<\/p><p> There is the question of purchasing properties, including distressed properties or those on the open market, for social housing.  I firmly believe that buying more private houses in different estates for social housing is a far better model, as it spreads social housing throughout the community, leading organically to everybody living in a more equal society.  I completely understand the need to build large-scale housing developments and we need plenty of social housing in all areas of the country and each street in every town in order to create the type of equal society we all seek.<\/p><p> Over the summer we saw disgraceful behaviour from universities with respect to on-campus accommodation, as the figures charged to young people starting at third level were dramatically increased.  There were also increases in the cost of on-campus accommodation for people in second or third year or those doing postgraduate courses.  Regulations were about to come into force and this stunt - it can only be described as such - from the universities and third level colleges came a couple of days beforehand.  Is there any way the Minister can rectify or address this by having the universities and other third level institutions to do the right thing by bringing this back to what it was?  All third level colleges and the surrounding areas should be deemed rent pressure zones.  It is one way of dealing with this once and for all.<\/p><p> I had a conversation on the meeting fringes with the Minister about emergency accommodation.  I agree with the principle that Tusla should have the power to inspect all emergency accommodation in an unannounced fashion.  Is the Minister's thinking in any way similar and would he consider exploring the matter by speaking with Tusla's new executive, Mr. Bernard Gloster?  I know he is exceptional as I worked with him when we was with the Health Service Executive in the mid-west.<\/p><p> There is the question of the rent-a-room scheme.  When people rent a room in their apartment or house, it works well by and large and such people can take in &euro;12,000 or &euro;13,000 tax-free for a room.  Has the Minister data on the take-up of the scheme and is it worth putting more resources into promoting it?  There is an ageing population and I know of several people in the city who have availed of it.  It has created a social space for them, as well as an income and it is working very well.  I have no doubt there are thousands of homes and apartments where single professional people, and perhaps even elderly or retired people, have the capacity to provide accommodation to young professionals.  Are there any data on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#L00500","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  I might jump around with the answers as there were some important questions and I want to ensure I can address them.  There has been some misunderstanding about what happened in the universities over the summer.  What may be advertised as \"rent\" is not actually rent until it is agreed.  As the new laws came into effect on 15 August, unless the universities increased rent for previous tenants, new tenants coming to accommodation this week, next week or the month after that would have their accommodation captured by rent pressure zones as per the legislation.  Those students have the protection of the legislation that was introduced earlier in the year.  The universities have been talking about increasing their rents since the third quarter of 2018 and that is one reason we moved to bring the change in legislation and those protections.  If the accommodation was rented last year, the rent cannot be increased beyond the 4% level.  If there is any concern about that, those students should absolutely access the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about Tusla inspections.  Inspections of emergency accommodation happen and when I met the Ombudsman I said that we absolutely want to ensure we can have trust in what is happening in our emergency accommodation.  The national quality standards framework is important and we must roll that out to emergency accommodation across the country.  We can then look at what might follow.  Tusla does not report to me on this matter but I raised this point with the Ombudsman.  All the appropriate checks in terms of Garda vetting and training are in place for the providers of emergency accommodation and hubs, and the local authorities and non-governmental organisations are responsible for the hubs they operate.  There is also a responsibility on private operators.  There is already an inspection system in place and there are already standards being rolled out nationally.  We will continue to see what more we can do to ensure people can have confidence in the type of accommodation being offered to families in particular at a time of emergency and crisis.<\/p> <p>  The cap for the rent-a-room scheme is still &euro;14,000.  Last year I helped to fund some student union organisations in getting the word out about this scheme and they presented very compelling data to me on the success of their campaigns, and how this has helped people, particularly in accommodation close to universities.  We do not hold data on the scheme as it does not fall under my Department.  Acquisitions are helping in areas where there are vacant properties and there is no demand in the private sector.  The process is also helping regeneration in a number of areas as well.<\/p> <p>  In 2018 we saw an eightfold increase in the number of social housing homes being built by local authorities since 2015, the year before the publication of Rebuilding Ireland.  People always say this number is coming from a low base but it is not any more.  More than 6,000 homes will be built this year and the stock of social housing is to be increased by 10,000 units.  It is why I publish the annual targets for each local authority and what numbers are then reached.  Everybody knows what they must do and what is achieved.  We have held a number of housing summits and they have been very helpful.  We have moved from housing summits with chief executives to more focused engagements with housing delivery teams in regions and specific local authorities.  In two local authorities, we have introduced the task force concept that we had in Cork; it is now across Galway city and county and it is starting to show results in what it will be able to do this year and next year.<\/p> <p>  Some local authorities are ramping up more quickly than others, and we have an engagement tomorrow at the County and City Management Association to see how we can get the better performing local authorities to help other local authorities.  We also have the new standard internal design document that has been published and the document for both the layout of social housing estates and the internal layout for homes.  It will help the local authorities that need such assistance to do better.  We can look at the increase in numbers and what is happening, and although it took a couple of years to gear up the local authorities, they are now geared up and delivery is coming.  I mentioned this morning that right now, there are more than 6,000 social housing homes on-site and under construction.  That number will continue to increase each month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#M00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>We can proceed to a second round of questioning and I propose a limit of two minutes for each speaker in the interest of fairness, if that suits everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#M00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I was genuinely surprised by two comments made by the Minister in our discussion around affordability.<\/p><p>He should correct me if I misrepresent what he said.  He seemed to indicate that he thought rent of &euro;1,200 per month is affordable and to suggest that &euro;310,000 as the purchase price of a house is affordable for a two-income couple on the average wage.  In the most comprehensive study of affordability to date, the ESRI states that for renting, affordability would be determined by 30% of net disposable income.  On a rent of &euro;1,200, one would need a net monthly income of &euro;4,000.  Clearly, it is affordable for such people.  However, we are looking for affordable housing for people who are above the threshold for social housing and, according to the Minister's rules, earning less than &euro;50,000 for a single applicant and &euro;75,000 for joint applicants.  That rent is not affordable for the Minister's system and rules; amounts of between  &euro;700 and &euro;900 are.  Likewise, if one is purchasing a home for &euro;310,000, there is a 10% deposit of &euro;31,000, which leaves a loan of &euro;279,000.  Under the Central Bank's rules, a gross income of &euro;79,000 is needed.  That household is above the threshold of eligibility for affordable housing.  It is also above the threshold for eligibility for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  Even if it were not, the average Rebuilding Ireland home loan across the State is &euro;200,000 or less.  Does the Minister know how many loans under the Rebuilding Ireland scheme Dublin City Council has offered since the scheme opened that are close to that price?  Only 16 have been drawn down.<\/p><p> Here is the problem.  We are trying to get the State to invest in a supply of affordable rental and purchase accommodation for households on incomes between &euro;38,000 and &euro;75,000.  None of the stuff the Minister is promising, meagre and all as it is in the context of numbers, is going to meet their needs.  Somebody will be able to afford what the Minister is offering; I am not doubting that.  Some people will pay for it even though it is not actually affordable according to mainstream ESRI rules.  Enniskerry Road and O'Devaney Gardens are the only developments we are seeing prices for and our big fear is that they are way off the Richter scale.  What I would like to know, and what those who are desperate for affordable housing would like to hear, is what is coming down the line for the families on &euro;38,000 to &euro;75,000 that will be affordable to them under the existing rules and mainstream understanding of affordability.  When will those units be available?  For the people we all represent, nothing is becoming available now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#M00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I think we all agree that the affordability gap can only be bridged by means of State-led intervention.  It is not going to happen if we leave it to the market.  It is not going to happen if we only do it in respect of social housing and hope that might have a knock-on effect.  When we look at what is actually coming on line through things like the serviced sites fund or the cost rental scheme, Dublin City Council has already identified two sites where there will be homes for less than &euro;200,000.  That is affordable.  There is now &euro;129 million for Dublin City Council under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme for 2018 and 2019 to give out that affordable mortgage product.<\/p> <p>  If we look at two people earning the average industrial wage, let us say it is approximately &euro;40,000, they have a combined income of &euro;80,000.  With the Central Bank rules, with help-to-buy, they can get the money together for a home at &euro;310,000.  The rent on a two-bed apartment on Enniskerry Road, which we are talking about being affordable, is &euro;1,200 or &euro;600 per person.  Those amounts are affordable.  However, there is a lot more work that we have to do regarding affordability.  It is on both sides of the ledger still.  We still have work to do on ensuring that all of those thousands of apartments that have planning permission are built.  We still have work to do to make sure that the significant level of funding we have provided to date for affordable homes delivers such homes.  It is also recognised that more than 12,000 households have been supported with help-to-buy and that more than 1,000 people have been able to buy homes using the Rebuilding Ireland home loan mortgage, which now has funding to support another 2,000 people up to the end of this year.  A huge amount is being done by the Government.  While we have to do more, we also have to recognise the complexity when it comes to individual sites such as Enniskerry Road, which require a number of partners and quite a bit of time to get things right.  That is why we engaged the European Investment Bank officially in May as a research partner to ensure that, as we do this at scale, things like cost rental will be properly affordable over the lifetime of the building.  As we bring affordable homes on-site across the country using the serviced sites fund, which is &euro;310 million, almost half of which has already been allocated, we must ensure that we are seeing homes such as those Dublin City Council is talking about in terms of Ballymun and Ballyfermot and that we are bringing on homes at those prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019091800002#N00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I have seven questions.

On Thornton Hall, I discussed the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality some time ago in respect of the Land Development Agency.  There is a potential use there but it will not necessarily be for housing because it does not have the infrastructure in place for that.

People should not be in emergency accommodation.  Some 80 families are in hotels as of June.  People are in hubs.  The damage to children is immeasurable and the scale of the trauma those children are facing, now and in their futures, is not properly understood.  Therefore I sincerely ask the Minister, his Department and other Departments to understand the impact.  If he does not have sufficient data he should commission it.  This should not happen to children today.  It should never again happen to such a large group of children in our State.  I would really like the Minister to give me a sense that he understands.

The scale of this challenge is incredibly significant.  It is not just that not enough homes were built for several years.  We also have net immigration because the economy is doing so well, which puts us under even more pressure to ramp up the delivery of new homes.  Regarding the scale of our response, by the end of this year 100,000 households will have been supported since the beginning of Rebuilding Ireland because of the work local authorities, my Department, housing bodies and NGOs have done across the country to help people.  That includes preventing people from becoming homeless in the first place, supports like the housing assistance payment, HAP, and getting people into social housing.  The important thing we have to do is drive the delivery of new homes.  The new data shows that the number of families exiting emergency accommodation into homes is up by something like 45% on the same period for last year.  That is important.  The number of families exiting emergency accommodation into social housing homes is also up by more than 50% on the previous period.  That is important too.

We will check those stories and talk to those people.  Some of them are single parents, who are disproportionately affected by the housing crisis.  They cannot find anywhere else to rent.  They fear being homeless with their kids.  They are particularly affected by this power imbalance.  I put it to the Minister that the correct position for him to take was not to have a go at myself and my party, which has raised criticisms of HAP in the past, but to express concern if there is any possibility that this might be the situation and to state his intention to put measures in place to deal with it.

Can the Minister give an update on that?  Moreover, has the Minister made any progress with his Cabinet colleague towards introducing regulation of the short-term letting platforms themselves where tourism is concerned?

I do not believe it will leave the Department open to any undue risk because, as I said to the Minister previously, the local authorities are responsible and answerable to him, and most, if not all, of them have the requisite experience and expertise.  Currently, county architects are sending back plans to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to be checked by juniors and are going back and forth in that respect.  We do not need to do that.

This is the guiding principle on which we base strategic and operational decisions.  As guardians of the peace, keeping people safe and safeguarding human rights are central to what we do.  Progress on our strategy statement is measured against the delivery of our annual policing plan.  So far this year, we have met the majority of our policing plan targets.  Many of these have had a direct impact on the community, such as the introduction of local protective service units to investigate crimes against the vulnerable, the continuing redeployment of Garda members from administrative roles to front-line duties, and an increase in roads policing detection of lifesaver offences.  In addition, we have introduced a number of strategies in areas such as a human resources and ICT that will deliver better support for our people resulting in improved service provision.<\/p> <p>  A key central element of our strategy statement is a new operating model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The operating model will introduce major changes to our structures and, more importantly for the public, it will provide more front-line garda&iacute;, increased Garda visibility and a wider range of policing services in their local area.  Ireland is changing and with this crime is changing.  However, the reality is that despite the very great efforts of all of my staff our own burdensome structures are holding them back from providing the best possible policing service.  This is supported by the Garda Inspectorate, which stated in its 2015 Changing Policing in Ireland report that fundamental structural change will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond with increased visibility and effectiveness to the needs of society today and in the future.  In addition, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland stated divisions should be large enough to be self-sufficient for all routine administrative and operational purposes.  The Policing Authority has welcomed the new model, stating that when implemented, it should result in an increase in Garda resources and greater autonomy at divisional level, which will make it possible to better respond to the specific needs of the local community.<\/p> <p>  The new operating model will see larger divisions with more resources available to the chief superintendents leading them.  A key focus of these divisions will be on community policing, with between 50% and 60% of all resources in each division devoted to this area.  As we have done in the four divisions where we piloted this model, community policing teams will be introduced that are dedicated to working with communities and other stakeholders to identify and tackle problem crimes in their area.<\/p><p>This should result in different agencies and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, working with us to break cycles of anti-social behaviour, drug dealing, and violence that can blight communities and the lives of individuals.  I believe this approach meets key recommendations from this committee's report on community policing and rural crime from earlier this year.  It will mean a local policing service based on local needs.  The public wants to see more garda&iacute; visible on the streets and so do I.  Our new operating model will help achieve this.<\/p><p> The model, along with long-needed investment in information and communications technology, ICT, such as our mobility app, will reduce the amount of time garda&iacute; have to spend in stations, time that they will spend out on the ground, on patrol instead.  We will receive a net increase of 800 Garda members under our recruitment programme between now and 2021.  This, combined with a further 1000 garda&iacute; released to front-line duties, will make a positive impact on the policing service we deliver.  Increased visibility in local communities will help provide reassurance that there is a strong policing presence, in line with a key recommendation of this committee.<\/p><p> Chief superintendents and superintendents will be empowered to make decisions on how policing is best delivered within their divisions.  This has been something that they have been wanting for quite some time.  This has been portrayed in some quarters as creating 19 mini-police services, but this will not be the case, nor is it my intention.  Local divisional officers - chief superintendents - will have the ability to make many more decisions of their own on how to police their area, but, in doing so, they will be subject to oversight at a regional and national level, and must operate within our corporate framework.  That way we will have consistency of delivery of service across the country, something we are aiming to be sure of in our service delivery.<\/p><p>I also note some of the commentary that Garda members, particularly superintendents will inevitably be pulled into wherever the divisional headquarters are placed.  That will not be the case and it is certainly not our intention.  While there may be some centralisation, largely of administrative resources, at the divisional headquarters, I am resolute that as many as possible superintendents will be in key locations throughout a division.  This has been achieved in the divisions that piloted the model.<\/p><p> In addition, specific administrative support and the introduction of the superintendent for performance assurance will remove a major bureaucratic burden from the community engagement superintendents, which they have sought for a long time.  As a result, the superintendents for community engagement will be freed up to get out from behind their desks and interact with their communities.  Communities have seen an increase in sergeants and inspectors and this will continue.  This will not only be of benefit to communities, but also to garda&iacute;.  A key request from our cultural audit was for more supervision.  Additional sergeants and inspectors will provide much-needed supervision, mentoring and guidance.<\/p><p> At a time the reporting of sexual and domestic violence is increasing, when many crimes have a digital element, and when financial frauds are increasingly complex, it is not sustainable to rely solely on our national units to investigate all such crimes.  Our new operating model will enhance the investigation of crime through the delivery of a greater range of specialised services in local areas such as the investigation of sexual crime, domestic violence, cybercrime, and economic crime.  Each division will be provided with a detective superintendent who, along with trained investigators in specialist areas, will be responsible for local crime investigation.  Complex or highly technical crimes will generally be dealt with at national level.  This widening of specialist services at local level will be supported by the introduction of an investigation management system, which will make it easier for those supervising investigations to oversee their progress but also for us as an organisation to understand the investigative demand that is placed on us as a whole.  This will have a number of benefits for victims.  In general, it should see their crime investigated more quickly and, particularly in the case of specialist crimes, by investigators well trained in that area.  More investigations being conducted locally, coupled with the investigation management system, should also mean information about the progress of the investigation is more readily available.<\/p><p> Our new operating model is in line with best international practice, is based on extensive consultation with our own people, has been recommended by both the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the Garda Inspectorate, and is supported by Government and the Policing Authority.  It will deliver a community-based, community-focused police service, which was a central recommendation of this committee.  An example of this commitment to community-focused policing is the recent permanent reallocation of Garda members to one or two-member stations in areas such as Emly and Toomevara in County Tipperary, and Ballyhale and Stoneyford in County Kilkenny.  These stations have not had a Garda member attached to them for a number of years and although not regarded as closed, they were opened only intermittently.  This is what we aim to do, increase our commitment to community policing in rural communities.  This is in addition to the six Garda stations to be reopened under the programme for Government.<\/p><p> We are also examining other options such as setting-up clinics in vacant stores in certain towns and villages but we are also using the An Post offices to set up in effect clinics where we meet the community.  Our strong connection with the communities we serve will not change.  It is one of the key reasons why we have a trust level among the public of approximately 90%.  The new operating model is being introduced under the Government's 'A Policing Service for the Future' plan.  This year, a number of improvements have been introduced as part of that plan, including regional control rooms, the start of the roll-out of the investigation management system, more garda&iacute; redeployed from administrative posts to front-line duties, and a range of measures to enhance our ability to deliver a human rights focused service.<\/p><p> Further benefits are to come before the end of the year include beginning with the roll-out of mobile phones for front-line officers, particularly those working in roads policing; starting the procurement for a new Garda uniform; accelerating our e-learning programmes, and further roll-out of new systems such as the investigation and management system, and the roster and duty management system.  I recognise that change is never easy, but our operating model is necessary if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to meet the needs of the public for a community-focused police service that focuses its resources and energy on keeping the people of Ireland safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

It is in that context that our operating model comes into play for the work we will do over the next three years to transform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that we can fulfil our mission of keeping people safe in their homes and communities.<\/p> <p>  Our policing plan sets out what we intend to do this year in delivering that service across the country.  The Policing Authority has commented favourably on our progress to date in delivering all of the goals in the areas we set out.  That is a good bill of health for 2019.  The operating model involves improving our services, structures and processes with the goal of delivering a better service to the community and keeping people safe in their homes and communities.  That means enhancing our community policing and the emphasis on what we are doing in the operating model is ensuring that we have more garda&iacute; available for front-line policing across the organisation so that people feel safe in their homes and communities, with particular emphasis on the most vulnerable people in society.  An example of that is setting up our protective services units that we will have in each division in the country.  <\/p> <p>  It is important that we as an organisation adapt to the changing society.  Crime and its nature are changing and the demography of communities is changing we have to be able to adapt to that policing environment.  Our structures have not changed for almost the past hundred years since the organisation was set up.  Given the investment that is taking place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this is an appropriate time for us to examine our structures and to enhance and improve the service and how we deliver it. <\/p> <p>  The operating model is part of the 'Policing Service for the Future' report, which was recently commissioned by Ms Kathleen O'Toole and her committee, following extensive consultation around the country.<\/p><p>There has been extensive consultation with the public, her colleagues, and stakeholders in terms of politicians and the public.  That wide consultation will go a long way towards informing us about how we deliver the new operating model. <\/p><p> The operating model will deliver what we set out in our strategy in respect of enhancing community policing, protecting the public in terms of being at home or in their communities, and all this must be done within the human rights context.  We want to make sure that our people are our greatest asset.  They want to help us to transform the organisation and deliver a policing service, which we require for the public.<\/p><p> The next four slides put the operating model into context.  We, in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are creating larger divisions so we can do more with our services.  Inevitably, we want to deliver more and have more garda&iacute; on the front line to deliver bespoke services to local communities.  To do that, we need to enhance our national services and regional supports, and all of this is heading towards improving and providing a better performance across the organisation.<\/p><p> What will larger divisions mean?  We are moving to larger divisions of between 600 and 800 personnel.  That will mean divisional officers will have the capacity to deliver a wider range of policing services across the organisation, be that dealing with economic crime or dealing with vulnerable people in terms of the protective services unit.  We are giving the divisions the capacity to deliver a local bespoke service that meets the needs of local communities, which is one of the major driving forces behind the local policing model.<\/p><p> We want to ensure that we have a sufficient number of garda&iacute; to meet the demands of the local policing services.  That is why we are moving from our district-based model, which was spread across 96 districts, to a new divisional model.  Effectively, the number will decrease from 128 administrative units to 19 and, therefore, we will have more operational resources to deploy to front-line policing.  Divisional officers, with larger numbers, will be able to provide a wider range of skills whether that is dealing with economic crime and cybercrime or dealing with protective services units.  Divisional officers will have the autonomy to decide which policing service will be delivered locally provided they operate within our corporate framework thus ensuring there is consistency in how we deliver our services across the organisation.<\/p><p> There will be more front-line garda&iacute;, which I will show on my next slide.  I reiterate that we are recruiting more garda&iacute; and garda staff, which will allows to redeploy more front-line garda&iacute;,  The fact that we have reduced our administrative hubs has, in the four areas where we are piloting this policing model, released more than 50 garda&iacute; from administrative posts back to front-line policing.  That is an example of how the operating model can change the Garda presence and service we provide to the public.  Indeed, when one passes through the airports now, one will see that the garda&iacute; have been released from that duty and the immigration service mans the booths at the airports. <\/p><p> Garda staff work in our control rooms.  So far this year, 33 garda&iacute; have been released to undertake front-line policing as a result of putting Garda staff into control rooms and we have another 31 garda&iacute; lined for the end of the year.  That means an initial 64 garda&iacute; are now delivering front-line policing to communities.  Our challenge is to make sure that when we release garda&iacute; from operations to undertake front-line policing that it is the type of service local communities need to match the demands of the local areas in which they work.  We are empowering the chief superintendents to say, \"We will give you more garda&iacute; and we will give more autonomy but it is up to your to match that to the demands of the local service\".  One can see from the figures on the slide that since 2017 we have brought more than 2,000 new members into the force.  An additional 1,000 staff are ready.  We have seen a reallocation because 480 Garda staff or members have been released to undertake front-line operational duties. <\/p><p> In the next part of the slide, it can be seen that an additional 1,500 Garda members will be brought into the Garda college and more than 1,200 Garda staff over the next two years, which will result in more than 1,000 members being released to undertake front-line policing.  This is, again, being done so that divisional officers can give a bespoke policing service to local communities and fulfil our mission to keep people safe in their local communities.<\/p><p> Enhancing the powers of local divisional officers and giving them more autonomy to deal with a greater range of services will allow our national services to focus on dealing with more complex and sensitive cases, which are high profile at times, whether that is international human trafficking or the work that is being done by the Garda drugs and organised crime unit.  In the past few days, some great work has been done by the unit to bring people before the courts and taking assets from people who have bee involved in crime.<\/p><p> Divisions will be the focus of how we deliver our service across the country, and by enabling our local divisional officers and divisions to do more locally with more services and resources then, at national level, we can concentrate on using our elite units to focus on delivering on the more complex, sensitive and high-profile crimes.  One will be able to see that across the organisation.  For example, we have more cybercrime facilities at local level because every criminal has a phone and we know that nowadays that is a central aspect in how people commit crimes and economic crimes.  We need to have the capabilities both nationally and locally to deal with that challenge.<\/p><p> We can provide armed support units across the entire country.  Indeed, we are expanding the service in the Border areas.<\/p><p> We have a new investigation management system so that our members can investigate crimes.  They can upload to the system all of the work that they have done so their managers can readily see all of the work that is being done.  The new system enables us to do our work faster and quicker.<\/p><p> I have given some examples of what we can do and provide.  Ultimately, this is about how we can improve our performance across the organisation.  As one can see from the slide, we are putting supports in place across the organisation.  Since 2018, there have been an additional 172 inspectors and 422 sergeants to support our people who deliver front-line policing.  At national level, we will appoint a deputy commissioner to lead our transformation programme and ensure that we improve our performance across the organisation both nationally and local levels.  A superintendent will lead our performance and accountability in delivering the change programme across the organisation.  From top to bottom, people will see greater accountability and a better focus on how we deliver services.<\/p><p> The next slide depicts the changes we can already see.  We have begun the restructuring programme and reduced the number of regions from six to four.  We have moved to streamline and flatten the organisation both at regional and divisional levels.  At regional level, we have retained the strategic parts of the organisation, in terms of the Border region and the north west, and merged them to make one unit.  The Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, is basically staying as it is.  The eastern region encompasses all of Leinster and the area around the DMR, and that will be the new eastern region.  The new southern region encompasses the existing region plus the Tipperary and Clare divisions.  The structural changes have taken place at regional level.<\/p><p> The next slide shows the changes that are taking place at national level.  We have reduced the number of divisions from 26 to 19.  I have outlined the changes that are taking place in streamlining and enabling the divisional officers who will lead the new divisions that comprise between 600 and 800 personnel.  The divisional officers, therefore, will have a larger number of personnel who are capable of delivering a wider range of services across the entire organisation.<\/p><p> What will we see next?  Changes have taken place in the regions through restructuring.  We have demonstrated our commitment to moving to 19 new divisions.  Over the next two to three years, one can see from the table the number of additional garda&iacute; who will provide front-line policing, and the increased capabilities that we will have at local level to deliver a range of policing services locally.  Ultimately, our model is about changing how we police and moving away from the district model to the new divisional model.  The goal of the organisation, be it at regional or national level, is to support the bespoke delivery of front-line policing services with the additional resources that the commissioner has received as part of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I have given a brief overview of the operating model and we will now take questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I thank assistant commissioner Finn for his presentation.

The Commissioner has just completed his first year in the job which I sincerely hope he is enjoying.  He has taken the organisation in a professional direction and instilled confidence.  The vast majority of the public are on his side and public confidence in the work he is doing is at an all-time high compared to his predecessors.  That has to be welcomed.  I hope he is enjoying the important work involved in his new role and the associated challenges.<\/p> <p>  It is commendable that Mr. Harris has introduced significant structural changes after less than 12 months.   Most people welcome the proposed reduction in the numbers of senior managers, namely, chief superintendents and superintendents, and the increased numbers of officers on the ground, especially those involved in community policing.  Also welcome is the assurance that garda&iacute; are moving from administration tasks to do the work they were trained to do within communities.  I would love to see that happen in other organisations.  If the Commissioner is considering a career move, perhaps he could move to the HSE because that organisation seems to be moving in the opposite direction.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Commissioner's comment that change is difficult and challenging.  That is particularly the case within communities when they see change.  I am the type of person who defends it when I believe it is being done for the right and appropriate reasons and the correct rationale behind it.  I want to talk briefly about the changes the Commissioner is proposing to make in the mid-west and the joining of the divisions in counties Clare and Tipperary, in particular.  We do not have the facility to display PowerPoint slides, but I want to show the Commissioner a picture of a bridge that is the only connection between counties Clare and Tipperary.  It is small and we are considering investing in a new one.  It connects Killaloe and Ballina.  I highlight its position as the map to which the Commissioner referred did not reflect the waterway between the two counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#G00200","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":612,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I would have thought counties Clare and Galway would have been a good fit.

They were drawn from my experience but also from international research and work done by the Garda Inspectorate and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  One of the design principles concerns what is a viable operational command structure for a chief superintendent to take on.  We looked at the scale of the command structure and the work that would be associated with it.  The Senator made a number of suggestions.  We considered all of them.  However, joining counties Clare and Limerick would have meant having a really lobsided model, given the scale of the command structure.  We would have been creating a division that was considerably larger than the others.<\/p> <p>  In creating this model I set out to ensure chief superintendents would take responsibility for the local areas.  I have freed up time for them by creating an administrative peer within a division.  That frees them and the other superintendents to concentrate on police work.  In addition, I have given them additional sergeants and inspectors.  This is about chief superintendents being responsible for operational delivery, supported by the structure around them.  I appreciate entirely that counties Clare and Tipperary are divided by a considerable waterway and that there is only one bridge.  I see local delivery of operations on a day-to-day basis being undertaken by sergeants and inspectors, with superintendents overseeing that work and the chief superintendent having oversight of the entire division.  That is our basic model for how we will deliver policing services.  <\/p> <p>  All of these aspects involve an element of compromise.  The compromises we have had to make in this case concern not only geography and the population numbers we could face but also the specific demands involved.  That has driven some of the decision-making and some of the decisions may be contentious.  However, in delivering this model across all of Ireland we have made the best fit in respect of what we want to see as our delivery model, namely, the divisional model.  We have to try to fit it as best we can with geography and population.  I appreciate the suggestions made by the Senator, but these models have been thought through.  We considered that it was not sustainable to give one individual oversight of counties Limerick and Clare or counties Galway and Clare.  It would be too large a command structure, too wide an expanse and place too many demands on the officer concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":615,"content":"<p>The assistant commissioner, Mr. Finn, wishes to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#G00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":616,"content":"<p>We did take cognizance of the fact that counties Clare and Limerick had a unique and close working relationship.

I did not make my comments lightly.  I respect the fact that much consideration has been put into this model.  However, there is one major issue that is concerning the people of County Clare.  We have to remember that it is unique.  We have an international airport at Shannon where there is an ongoing security threat as a result of the use of the airport for refuelling and stopovers by the United States military.  There is a constant Garda presence.  Many of the Commissioner's colleagues were based in County Clare in the last three or four months when President Trump and Vice President Pence passed through the airport.  We also have the second busiest tourist attraction in the country, the Cliffs of Moher which are visited by more than 1.5 million people every year.  Hundreds of thousands more visit tourist destinations in the rest of the county.  People could live with the new structure, but the single biggest concern is that the divisional headquarters is being moved from County Clare to County Tipperary.  It is an open and shut case that the divisional headquarters should be located in Ennis because of the international airport at Shannon and given the significant tourist numbers with which we are dealing in County Clare.  We only have to look at the profile of police activity in the county in the last six months to see that that is the case.  This issue is of such concern to the people of County Clare and their representatives that a special meeting of the local authority, Clare County Council, will take place next Monday to discuss it.  I am seeking an assurance from the Commissioner that the divisional headquarters in the Clare and Tipperary division will be located in Ennis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#G00800","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his representations.

Wherever the headquarters is located, I am absolutely determined to ensure the superintendents, particularly those who are community focused, will be dispersed geographically.<\/p><p>As far as is possible I will also be asking for the detective superintendents to be dispersed.  The chief superintendent will not be sitting in a corridor with the four superintendents in the next offices.

We take account of critical infrastructure such as airports, the crime profile, the population profile, major events and the tourism profile.  Those things are all under consideration.  I note the increase in supervision which we have had already in the form of sergeants and inspectors.  Supervision will be increased further as we appoint a further 150 sergeants and 75 inspectors.  We will have plenty of supervision and command on the ground, including operational command and tactical command.  We will also have additional numbers.  We have described those already.  I refer to the increase in the overall size of the organisation, as is evident today.  Including Garda members and Garda staff, we are larger than we have ever been.  Our numbers are set to increase further.  I am also determined to ensure that we maximise our overall impact, including community policing, the work of the divisions and the work of national units.

We are working closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  Next week we will have our annual joint agency task force meeting, at which we set out the agenda for dealing with organised crime, including organised crime against Revenue, for the year ahead.

We will, however, have to fall back on a far more complex process rather than the European arrest warrant, but, overall, we are ready.  We have, in effect, been thinking about this matter for two years and building up resources in the Border area during that time.  In November we will have a further passing out parade.  That will allow us to further supplement some of Border county divisions.  We have also built up our resources in the armed support unit.  We have about a further 30 members who are trained and ready.  We are looking towards the introduction of an armed support unit in Cavan to reduce response times in the Border area.

Dublin Airport is not far from Rush and the M1 motorway adjoins it.  It was eventually announced that the Garda station would need to be refurbished substantially before it could be opened.  This refurbishment has been ongoing throughout the summer and in July I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW to see when the work of refurbishment would be finished and the station would open.  I was told by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran that it would be handed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the end of September.

May I say at the outset that it is wonderful at the end of Mr. Harris's first year as Commissioner to be meeting him and having such a positive engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I acknowledge as the Chairman did at the start of the meeting today, that since I became a member of the Oireachtas committee on Justice and Equality, we have had so many engagements with Mr. Harris's predecessors and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that were caught up in the controversies of the day.  To be attending a meeting that is discussing positive things such as redeployment of Garda, structural change, looking at the future and also to do that against the backdrop of a policing authority report coming out, acknowledging not just the success rate of the implementation of that change and the hitting of targets but also recognising that there is through the current leadership team a dynamic element to that change and I want to see that.  It is incredibly positive.<\/p> <p>  I wish to drill down on a number of issues.  There are pilot schemes and they have been obviously successful.  Can Mr. Harris give us a brief outline of how the public would see the difference between the service that was being delivered in the past and the service that is now being delivered?  Obviously that gives us the best feel of what the public will eventually hopefully see on a national basis?<\/p> <p>  May I clarify something on the divisional regional structural change and the worry that might exist around divisional command stations.  My understanding of what the Commissioner is trying to do is to effectively enhance the delivery and the quality of all stations throughout the new divisional regional structure so that there is a much more equal spread of ability to deliver both localised policing and directly implement those decisions so that it is not really a loss but an enhancement across an entire area.  I am interested in an update on ICT and where we are on that.  It has been a bugbear for quite a while and I would be very interested to hear about the funding that the Government has provided.<\/p> <p>  I know that when there is structural change there always are reservations and it is vitally important not only to bring the people to whom you provide the service, which is the public but also the members and staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with you.  I would be interested to learn about the experience of the officers in those pilot programmes, and whether the officers think it is a better structure to work within.  One of the things in terms of the consultation process that I know was shown up very clearly was the level of dissatisfaction within the membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the very top down non-consultative, non involvement way in which the previous structure worked.  I would be interested to see how that has played out.<\/p> <p>  Again in the context of this terrific redeployment to the front line, Mr. Harris answered one of my colleagues by saying that it was obviously to deliver better services.<\/p><p>Are the witnesses talking about community policing still being at the heart of the process?  That is really part of what the reform programme is about, and it should be the end goal of every structural change and every method that has been introduced to make change.  In that context, perhaps the witnesses will talk about the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has met its targets for quarter 1 and quarter 2 for the 500 plus redeployment of garda&iacute;.  Where have they gone, primarily?  What types of roles are those garda&iacute; filling and are they touching directly in the area of community policing?  In general, I believe that what has happened so far within a 12 month period has been  a terrific success story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#K01800","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. Finn, to refer to the pilot areas and the experience of that over the past two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":675,"content":"<p>We have four pilot areas in Cork city, Galway, Mayo and Dublin South Central.  This local policing model only started officially in the first quarter of this year but we have been planning for it over a two year period.  There has been wide consultation on the local policing model and how it is going to be delivered at local level.  On the initial impact, we have had only one quarter where we have had it fully operational, even though we have been ramping it up since last year.  The impact locally has been very positive.  This is primarily because we have been able to take the savings we achieved as result of centralising our administration and civilisation programme - where we put civilian staff into the control rooms - which allowed us to put garda&iacute; back out onto the front line policing the State.  Immediately there is a win for the public because we are able to beef up community policing teams.  That is one example in an urban centre.  Divisions such as Galway or Mayo, for example, would have the benefit of allowing more garda&iacute; to go back into some rural stations.  That is the emphasis in places such as Galway.  From talking with Chief Superintendent Tom Curley I am aware that this is what he is trying to achieve initially.  During the period of austerity we took a lot of resources out from those smaller rural areas and sucked them into the centre, effectively to keep our 24-7 services going.  Now the chief superintendent in the Galway division is able to put garda&iacute; into those smaller, rural stations and increase our footprint.  That is where we are getting bang for our buck in the impact of our operating model and changing our structures.<\/p> <p> With regard to the public, it is now easier for people to engage with us.  In the past a person might have had to write to three or four different superintendents to get an answer to a question.  Now a person may write to divisional HQ, which will look after all of the administration.  We have taken the administration away from the superintendents and we have also taken away a lot of the work they may have done in the past such as going to court or having to investigate complaints, which was taking perhaps 30% or 40% of their time.  We have taken that away from superintendents so they can spend more time out there engaging with their communities, and understanding what needs to be done for delivering that policing service locally.<\/p> <p>  These are some of the benefits we have seen in the four pilot areas where we ran the local policing model, which is one part of the overall operating model we are bringing about.  While the local policing model and structural changes are the very public dimension of the reform a lot of it is about streamlining our back office services and trying to reduce the administration, right from the top of the organisation down to the bottom.  It is about freeing up local garda&iacute; so they can be deployed back out into front-line policing.  Another example is the airports.  If one goes through Dublin Airport now one will not see garda&iacute; manning the booths like we had in the past.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service does that now.  Those resources can now be deployed back to increasing our drugs and organised crime units right across the State.  The feedback has been very positive so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":676,"content":"<p>That is the public element of the feedback, which is vital, but I also want the witnesses to tell us about the whole area of reservations, which we have heard about.

Not exactly; not until the investigations they currently have in their in-trays are washed out.  Then they will see even more benefits from the reform.  As they go along they will see the richness of it, plus the fact that we have taken a lot of simple administrative tasks away from them.  As that begins to progress and we expand it across the country then all boats will be lifted by reducing that administrative burden and the amount of time that is tied up in that work.  This is really where one can see the benefit.  Our own Garda staff who do the back-office support can see that they are building their teams and their teams are becoming more experienced and more efficient as this gets rolled out.  There is also the learning we acquired from having piloted the model in four areas, which can be taken to the other divisions so they will not have to go through the same pain of trying to implement new processes and new procedures.  We will be able to ramp up the speed at which we can deliver the model across the State, using the learning from the first pilot areas moves on.  The feedback so far has been positive internally and from the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Finn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I will touch on some of the other matters.  Where we have replaced a Garda member with a staff member, by and large that garda has stayed in his or her local area and has started to deliver policing.  We have already outlined some of the impact of that such as being able to supplement the response units and the 24-7 units.  We have also been able to re-staff stations that we had retained but within which our presence had not been retained, with only a nominated member or a couple of members assigned to the station.  That has been a big advance.  This also applies to our other community policing teams in the cities.  Some of those redeployments have been in headquarters where perhaps a superintendent, inspector or sergeant had held a role and once they finished in that role had moved on, and they were then replaced by a staff member.  In effect that prevented somebody else being brought in.  We are keeping a focus on operational delivery by sworn members of the organisation.  We see this as a positive.  The next step will be different because we will be identifying roles currently being undertaken by members, which will have a more direct impact with the public.  I refer to the front desk type role.  We have a lot of resources tied in to providing front desk services and 24-7 services in lots of areas, and in maintaining that using Garda staff members.  Again, this would release sworn Garda members for patrol duties.  The focus is very much on community policing.<\/p> <p>  It must be said about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it has a strong community focus and there are very fine people working in the organisation.  They have asked for many of the reforms we are now putting in place.  We can see this through the cultural audit.  They want to be freed up from bureaucracy and they want to get out there to provide the service to their local communities.  There is a great attachment between the service they provide and the local communities.  We want to make sure that this is not eroded and that it is enhanced.<\/p> <p>  There is a 90% confidence rating in the organisation, which is very significant.  Regrettably, the senior leadership team is languishing at around 42% to 45%.  We have a lot of work to do to make sure the public can see that we are leading an organisation and making sure we are providing all the supports we can to personnel on the front line, whatever it might be.  It might be community policing and it can be the national units and specialist detective work.  We are also a national police service and we have a wide range of demand placed upon us.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of information communications technology, ICT, one of our focuses is to try to make things easier for the individual garda out on patrol.  The mobility programme is a particular focus for that.  Members will have a phone that will have functionality to allow the garda to take a photograph of a licence or a number plate and then get connectivity back into our records.  This is a significant improvement.  It worked very well when we piloted it and now we want to run it out to roads policing and to critical areas where there is a lot of policing demand.  That will start this year and should be rolled out by the end of 2020.<\/p><p> I have mentioned some of our other significant programmes, including the resource deployment management system, which is essential in order that we know where our people are, what they are doing and when they are there.  The paper-based system we have at present does not really give us the management tools we need to achieve that.  This important initiative is not being introduced as a cost saving but as a management tool.  I think it will make a significant enhancement because we will know better where our resources are at any given time.  The investigation management system will also give us much more information about the demands that are placed on us.  When all of this is considered alongside developments like the second generation of the command control system, it is clear that we are starting to build up a better picture of the demands that are being placed on us and of how we are spending our resources in meeting those demands.  We are also better placed to assess whether there is more we should do in terms of the structure of the organisation and the skills within the organisation to meet changes in demand.<\/p><p> These ICT systems are very significant.  ICT will always be going through evolution and change.  We are probably skipping a generation of criminal justice ICT systems, but that is all to the good.  We can learn from what others have done.  We can implement the things they have found useful while being innovative in our own right in terms of what we want to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":680,"content":"<p>That is interesting.

It is important to note that the transformation we are discussing is coming about on the back of very serious reports and on the back of people's pain.  Nothing was learned from the Morris tribunal, which cost the country a fortune.  The O'Higgins report was followed by the Charleton report, which touched on the Garda in addition to other matters.  It is very important to mention these reports because they are why we are here now looking at these glossy brochures.<\/p> <p>  The first practical thing I would like to note is that Assistant Commissioner Finn welcomed the opportunity to make an overhead presentation as a means of communicating to those members of the force who may be watching today's proceedings.

It is extraordinary that we have to go down the road of embedding a code of ethics.  It is mentioned on page 19 of one of the documents that we have been furnished with that 95% of Garda personnel are to be trained in this code of ethics and all trained personnel are to have signed up to the code by the fourth quarter of the year.  Where are we with that?  Where are we with the Crowe Horwath report, which is mentioned on page 16?  It seems that an action plan for the report was to have been agreed in the first quarter of the year and its implementation was to have commenced thereafter.  Where are we with that?  The report in question was commissioned by the Policing Authority on the back of what happened with the figures for mandatory intoxicant testing and the fixed penalties.  Where are we with that?<\/p> <p>  I am not happy with Mr. Nugent's reassurance that work is under way on statistics.  The need to be able to rely on statistics and on what is being reported in terms of crime and in terms of the other context goes to the kernel of public trust in the Garda.  The Committee of Public Accounts was told at some stage - it may have been by the CSO, but I stand to be corrected - that there is absolutely no way that reassurance can be given in respect of these figures in the immediate future.  Has the force arrived at a point where it can tell us at what stage in the future we will be able to rely on its figures?<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the press office.  When the new divisions are in place, will there be a single national press office or will there be a number of press officers?  I welcome the emphasis on community garda&iacute; on the ground.  I despair that it has taken so many reports and so much hurt for us to go back to the idea of having a trusted police presence on the ground, which we all knew was the right thing in the first place.  That is what we always wanted to do because it is what communities want.  Will the press office be broken up along with everything else that is being broken up?

Can technology provide some answers concerning individuals on remand going backwards and forwards to court?  Can it be done by video link to remove the reason for prisoner transfers, completely in some cases?  Can other technological solutions be applied?<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of thought being devoted to this.  It was the subject of work over a couple of years and this has revitalised that.  We hope to see, in the next two years, some of the responsibilities migrating across.  It will probably be for the Department.  A lot of this is within the family of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It will decide on how the resource cake is divided up.  That will follow undoubtedly.  I will make my case but I am sure my peer group will also make its case.  It will be a case of saying, \"If you are not doing this, then we need the money to buy in the service in whatever shape or form is necessary.\"  It is not straightforward.  With regard to some of the things we are doing, we probably represent the most expensive way of doing them to the Exchequer.  There are probably more cost-effective ways of proceeding, particularly regarding court security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":712,"content":"<p>If there are to be courts services, prison services or agencies looking for additional money from the package of money that comes through the Department of Justice and Equality, will there be a reduced allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because agencies will take on its work?

On the prevention of this type of incident, we are a police service, but a police service is, in effect, an extension of good citizenship.  Our goal is to ensure that we can prevent and detect crime, with prevention being the most important element of that.  We want the public to have confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and see it as a reassuring presence such that people know that if they see or hear something suspicious, they can make contact with the Garda and we will respond properly to that.  It is to be hoped that through such co-operation we can prevent serious incidents such as that referred to by the Deputy from occurring.  There are daily successful interventions through patrols, the use of intelligence and acting on information that comes from the public.  We work best when we work closely with local communities and receive information which allows us to act on their concerns and prevent crime or, where crime occurs, apprehend those who engage in it.  That is society's role in terms of good citizenship.  We are here to protect members of society and will do our utmost in that regard.  We are all dedicated to it.<\/p> <p>  Regrettably, I cannot give an assurance that an incident such as this will not happen again.

A considerable proportion of these officers' effort - and as I have said, between 50% and 60% of their resources are dedicated to community policing - will be expended on delivering our community policing function.  More and more we can see that it is not only down to what we do as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but is about how we work with other agencies and the relationships we form and partnerships we have.  These allow us to jointly identify and deal with some of the more persistent problems around anti-social behaviour through, for example, preventing street-level drug dealing and dealing with very serious crimes, such as domestic abuse, which have a devastating impact on families and relationships but can also have a devastating impact on an area or location.<\/p> <p>  Overall, by freeing up divisional officers and allowing them to be more operationally autonomous and by freeing up personnel in order that these officers will have the personnel to deliver this policing function, we believe that we will see an increase in the quality of policing and an improvement in the amount that we are able to provide through the development of a policing service for the future.  As we get on to a more formalised footing in our relationships with other State agencies, we can start to have a real impact on quality-of-life issues that are impacting on critical neighbourhoods.

I come from Dundalk, County Louth.  I have noticed a serious issue and I do not know whether the Commissioner is fully aware of it.  More than 400 people from County Louth are reported missing every year.  Information on missing person reports is included in the Garda annual report.  Statistics are also available on a county-by-county basis.  County Louth has one of the highest rates of missing persons per head of population.

We should be thankful that many of these missing people are found safe and sound.  Sadly, a number are found deceased and others remain missing.  Can the Garda provide details of the number of missing persons who are found deceased and the number of people who remain missing, both nationally and in my native county of Louth?  As an island, unidentified remains are washed up on our shores or found in other circumstances.  Can the Garda give an indication of the number of unidentified persons discovered in Ireland?  Are there records of all cases and, if so, where are they kept?  <\/p> <p>  At times, only partial remains are recovered.  What procedures are in place for such cases?  What efforts are under way to obtain DNA samples from the partial remains found over the years?  As the taking of DNA samples for the Garda database is a relatively new initiative, what actions are the Garda taking to solve cold cases involving the unidentified persons who have been buried in cemeteries across the country where no DNA samples were taken?  Other countries, such as the UK, are carrying out audits of cases of unidentified remains on a county-by-county basis.  In some instances exhumation is carried out to obtain DNA samples.  Is a similar project planned for Ireland?  If not, why?  It would solve many cases for families, as it has done in the UK.  Audits also solve some cases.  We all know that it is not nice to be missing a daughter, a son, a brother, a father or a mother.  There are an awful lot of unmarked graves in this country.

Will sufficient resources be available to cover the whole expanded area?<\/p><p>Will local Garda districts still be headed by a superintendent?<\/p><p> As the Commissioner knows, we have had a fair bit of trouble in the past few years, with two garda&iacute; in County Louth being murdered.  However, we have great confidence in the way the system is being operated.  With Brexit, all we hear in the news is that the PSNI has asked for hundreds more officers and that it is getting them.  Has the Garda Commissioner asked for extra resources?  I was disappointed to read in the national newspapers in recent days that the overtime bill had increased by 20%.  Much of it may be due to the visit of the President and the Vice President of America.  There is talk that there is an extra &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million for overtime and that the Garda is expected to take it out of its current budget.  As I said from day one, I offer my full support to the Garda.  The Commissioner has a good team and I think they are doing everything right.  I grew up in Dundalk and know, having seen what happened there, that nobody wants to see the Troubles come back as a consequence of Brexit.  We can all see what is happening in Derry.  The Border is more than 300 miles long.  Even in County Louth, it runs from Cullaville to Omeath.  There are nearly 50 border crossings and in recent years many small roads have been built along it.  Much good work has been done.  I know of the Commissioner's connections with the PSNI.  The Garda and PSNI have worked well together for a long time.  Nobody wants to see the United Kingdom leave the European Union, but there is uncertainty.  Things are fine and people do not like to see changes, but they are concerned about the new divisional plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#Q00800","speaker":"1441","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":745,"content":"<p>With regard to implementation, we will come to the Border divisions last when we are certain about how the model works.  We recognise this in the period we are entering, with Brexit firmly on the horizon.  I also give an assurance about the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  The divisional headquarters will be well situated in the region.  We are conscious that that division, with the Sligo and Donegal division, is policing the Border.  Depending on what happens with Brexit, it could also be an international border for the European Union, something we have to factor in too.  We have to factor in the various demands that have been talked about, including the threat mentioned by the Deputy and also organised crime.  We have to address the issue of how secure people feel to ensure they will not feel raiding across the Border can happen.  We will continue to work closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in that regard.  It will include joint operations on either side of the Border, all of which are set to continue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned incidents in Derry.  When such incidents happen, we are always quick to respond on this side of the Border, in County Donegal, to make sure we support the PSNI.  It would be the same across the Border.  People expect this of us.  I offer the Deputy assurance about the numbers we will have available.  We have divisions which are responsive and focused on local delivery.  We will also be there as an organisation, both at regional and national level, to support them with additional resources, including specialist resources.  People have expressed concerns, but they should be set against what happens.  The division will have a dedicated detective superintendent to oversee the investigation of crime.  It will have a detective inspector appointed to the protective services unit to oversee the investigation of crimes against the vulnerable, including domestic abuse, serious sexual assault, child abuse, etc.  We will bolster the number of inspectors and sergeants and free up officers from many administration tasks.  Our focus will be on delivery of the local policing plan.

That makes sense and is fair.  I come from Killybegs in south-west Donegal.  We will be farther away from the police district head office.  My experience is that the farther one is from the head office, the less one will see and the less that will actually happen.  That may not happen with this process, but my fear is that it will.  In my part of County Donegal there are a number of Garda cars with more than 300,000 miles on the clock.  That presents a difficulty.  At weekends garda&iacute; are left on their own in stations.  We have no resources for training on how to deal with cybercrime.  Training stopped at level 2 interviewing.  There is a no-deal Brexit plan, which is understandable, but members of the force believe there is not one.  There are not enough garda&iacute; to keep open the stations which are supposed to be open.  How will that change with the new process?  In Killybegs there may be a disco on a Saturday night, with perhaps 400 or 500 young people and one garda to police it.  That is not safe for the garda, let alone members of the public.  It is not acceptable for one garda to operate alone.  How will that change under the new plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#R00700","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":751,"content":"<p>There is roster reform.  The current roster loads staff towards the beginning of the week.  We want to change it in order that it will more accuately reflect the demands placed on us to provide a service.  Much of it is about the night-time economy across Ireland.  The second thing we want to achieve in changing the roster is the provision of training time in order that we will not be training in overtime, that it will not necessitate backfilling and that training can be done while on duty in order that members can avail of training regularly such that it is part of their cycle of shifts.<\/p> <p>  Brexit planning has been ongoing for 24 months.<\/p><p>Those who are perhaps unclear about what we have decided probably need to speak to their regional AC because there has been a lot of meetings, conversation and consideration of how we will manage Brexit, the various scenarios that might arise and how we will deal with them and liaise with the PSNI.  A lot of Brexit planning has happened.  I entirely refute the suggestion that there is no Brexit plan.  We have made, as best we can, provision for what Brexit may bring.  We have had to deal with some of the things we feared would happen because there has been an increase in the number of attacks by groups such as the New IRA in Northern Ireland.  That has a consequence for us in terms of operations.<\/p><p> I appreciate that the committee submitted five questions.  At the moment, Donegal and the Sligo-Leitrim division have 794 personnel in total between them, comprising Garda staff and members.  That figure is set to increase.  It is a sizeable command for the chief superintendent to lead and the division will have flexibility in how it uses resources to meet its policing plan and local policing plan issues.  I want the chief superintendents to deliver a bespoke service that answers local needs.<\/p><p> I am conscious that some of the divisions encompass large geographic areas.  In terms of personnel, they would marry with some of the divisions in the DMR, but they are far more concentrated.  I am conscious of how geographically dispersed some divisions are and I am determined that our services will be spread equally and there will not be an Eircode postcodes lottery in the service people receive from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have built up some of the specialisation within divisions because the work is becoming more commonplace.  Regrettably, increased reporting of economic crime, including fraud, as well as other crimes I have mentioned such as domestic abuse, serious sexual assault and child abuse, means that there has to be more of a divisional response to address these matters.

That point was repeated by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the Policing Authority in its report, which also commented on the provision of the policing service and our responsiveness to changing demand.<\/p> <p>  The district model could not survive.  There was far too much administration and bureaucracy and the packets of personnel were too small.

We are taking out a tier of administration so that we can focus more of our resources on other areas.  We are focusing on local accountability and delivery, which is the position of JPCs, and we will deliver a local policing plan.

I do not question the professionalism or the friendliness of individual garda&iacute; whom I have witnessed get on board vehicles, but they do not ask me or people who look like me for passports or papers, and people who do not look like the Commissioner or me are asked for papers.

My understanding is there is no legislation on checks at the land Border in respect of the common travel area, which we are all assured will be maintained and sustained whatever happens around Brexit.  There are deep reservations about these searches and I think they stack up and firm up.  As a cross-Border worker who uses public transport to get to work and who witnesses these searches, I believe there has been an increase in the number of searches, even from an anecdotal perspective.  I would therefore be interested to hear about the legislation in this regard and the way in which members of the Garda are directed.  To be fair, if they have not been directed or if there has been perhaps a clumsy or haphazard approach to this thus far, consideration might be given to engagement with the Garda officers responsible in order that they have a clear understanding of not only their legal responsibilities but also their societal responsibilities not to fall into the realm of potentially racial profiling people travelling north and south.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#W00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":814,"content":"<p>From my understanding and what I have seen of the matter, these are operations directed towards organised crime involvement in immigration-type crime.

For the past 12 months, I have been pushing for a centralised database to be established.

I am very concerned about this.  What is the Commissioner's view on the issue?  My understanding is that when a body is recovered and not identified, the information stays within the coroner's area.  What I have been pushing for is for all of the information to be centralised in order that there would be joined-up thinking in trying to match information.  For instance, there were two cases in the past 12 months.  One involved a person who had disappeared in Limerick in 2000.  The remains were washed up in County Clare nine months later, but it took 17 years for somebody to put two and two together.  The other case involved a person who had gone missing in Dublin about ten or 11 years ago.  Three months after they had gone missing, remains were washed up in County Louth, but nobody put two and two together until last year.  These are the two cases about which I am talking.

It impacts on people deeply.<\/p> <p>  There have been successes in identifying unidentified bodies through a process involving DNA samples taken from family members.  I think that process has only emerged in the past four or five years.  Although DNA samples have been used from the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the process has only been applied to such cases in recent times, with success being achieved both in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The attraction is that if a body is recovered from the sea, one can quickly go through DNA records to resolve matters quickly for the family.  The vagaries of the tides and currents in the Irish Sea can mean that bodies can travel right across it.  The bodies of people who have gone missing in Ireland have turned up along the Anglesey coast.  It does not just involve a national response.  We must look at the response across the Irish Sea also.  I do not think we compartmentalise.  If somebody is missing, we take notice of it nationally.  Forensic Science Ireland has taken a national approach to the issue in the investigation of remains that have been recovered.  We have assisted in investigations which may have directed it towards identifying a recovered body as being the remains of a certain individual.  DNA testing allows this to be clarified with certainty.  There is quite a piece in this and I would like to have the opportunity to consider it.

When the debate was taking place in the Seanad, a family came to see me in Dublin about the case where a family member had disappeared two years previously.  There is a provision in the coroners Act, under which the Minister for Justice and Equality can request a coroner to hold an inquest, even where a body has not been recovered.  I wrote to the Minister and as a result of that letter, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na came to the family's house to take DNA samples to be sent to Wales and France.  My point is that there should be reciprocity.  If there was to be a case involving someone in Wales writing to the Irish authorities, there would be no centralised database.<\/p> <p>  I will follow up with a tied-in question.  It concerns the case in Limerick involving the late Gussie Shanahan.  What I am really disappointed about - I have written to the Commissioner about the matter - is that the family had to wait 17 years before being called into the Garda station in October 2018 to be advised that the remains that had been washed up in County Clare were those of the father's late son and his daughter's late brother.  Some 11 months later the relevant documentation has not been sent from Limerick to the coroner in County Clare to enable them to hold an inquest and for a death certificate to be issued.  The family are really concerned and contacted me about four weeks ago.  It is disappointing that, having waited 17 years, they are still waiting 11 months later for a death certificate to be issued.  It has been a really difficult time for them and everyone else involved.  I wonder if that issue could be dealt with also.  There should not be such a time delay when there is clear evidence that the person is deceased and the appropriate correspondence has been sent to the coroner for the particular area.

In his initial contribution Mr. Harris touched on the concern expressed across the country that all superintendents would be based in the divisional headquarters.  I know that he stressed that that would not be the case in this instance, but I am not na&iuml;ve enough to believe that will happen in reality.  I have heard many heads of organisations state before an Oireachtas committee that staff would remain deployed across the country.  Whether it happens by osmosis or otherwise, over time they drift to the location of the central headquarters.  I have a genuine concern about the divisional headquarters based in Roscommon.  I find what Mr. Harris has said, that a new approach is being taken, very surprising because on occasion his predecessors tried to move the divisional headquarters from Roscommon to Castlebar.  That concern is being raised again.<\/p><p>They tried to move the divisional headquarters from Mullingar to Navan and, funnily enough, that is there again.  I believe that over time, we will see all of the superintendents based in the divisional headquarters.  If we look at the alignment being proposed, we can see the likelihood is that the superintendents will be based in Castlebar and Navan.  Project Ireland 2040 talks about designating Athlone as a growth centre and how all Government policy must take that into account.  It has not taken it into account on this occasion.  With this reconfiguration, the likelihood is that the nearest superintendent to Athlone will be in Thurles in County Tipperary, which is not good enough.  We have a structure where the divisional headquarters in Roscommon is slap bang in the middle of this proposed revision.  It would make sense to service the three counties by locating it there and I hope that would be reflected in any decision and would leave a divisional headquarters within 30 km of Athlone.  <\/p><p> With regard to the pilots in Galway and Mayo, two rural districts, is there a superintendent in every one of those district headquarters because that is the concern we all have?  I welcome the increased footprint and more resources going to local Garda stations but the decisions will be made by superintendents and chief superintendents, these are very large geographic areas and it is important that these headquarters are located as centrally as possible within the various divisions.  <\/p><p> Can the Commissioner give a commitment that there will be no barrier to staff transferring between the divisions?  We were provided with those assurances when the HSE was divided up across the country and yet staff could not move from one geographic area to another.  I want a commitment from the Commissioner that if someone in Meath or Louth wants to transfer to Roscommon, Mayo or Galway, the fact that this person is in a different division will be not be a barrier to that transfer.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#Y01000","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":854,"content":"<p>I will address the second point first.  I will give that commitment.  We are a national organisation that provides a national service.  If people apply for a transfer, obviously, they need a vacant post to transfer to but that is often the only impediment to individuals moving between divisions.  There is no bar to that.  It requires an organisational need as well.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the superintendents, I reiterate that we are not building new super-headquarters.  Our infrastructure will not permit all the superintendents to be in one building so no matter what I say, unless they are all going to sit out in the backyard, they will not all be in the one building.  We do not have the space or the estate to do that.  I am also fearful because things happen through osmosis despite grand plans but I have no intention of seeing superintendents gradually drift into divisional headquarters.  Superintendents will be out and visible, not only to their staff but to their local communities.  I can give the Deputy an absolute assurance about that.  <\/p> <p>  We are taking a long look at where we situate divisional headquarters.  We have consulted with the regional assistant commissioners and chief superintendents and we are taking a range of factors into account.  We have to have divisional headquarters where chief superintendents will be based but all of these things are entirely consistent with superintendents being diffused throughout the division.  If I may use the example of Mayo, which is a pilot, superintendents have remained spread throughout that county so we have had a community engagement superintendent based in Claremorris and Ballina, while the divisional headquarters have been in Castlebar.  That is the model we applied in Galway as well and is the model we will apply in these rural divisions.  We want the superintendents to be out and about, not all situated in one divisional headquarters.

It is clear that we have not received our fair share of resources be they personnel on the ground or the car fleet.  The drugs unit in our county is completely under-resourced.

Templemore Garda station, which is a 24-hour Garda station, cannot be kept open because of lack of personnel.  They are all issues about which people in the county have serious concerns.<\/p> <p>  With this reorganisation, we see Tipperary being amalgamated with Clare.  Tipperary is a county with an area of 4,305 sq. km with a population of 160,000.  It is 150 km in length from top to bottom.  I heard my colleague from Clare talk earlier about the bridge in Killaloe.  It is the only land connection between Tipperary and Clare.  Last Saturday, there was a 6 km tailback on that bridge.  Thankfully, it is a tourist destination and is extremely busy during the summer but it is the only land connection between the two counties.  When I was in my office, I heard it said that there was extensive consultation about these divisional boundaries.  As a Deputy, I can say that there was no consultation with Deputies in the county and my colleagues have said the same to me.  I spoke to members of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, who told me that there was no consultation with them and I spoke with senior members of the force who feel there was very little consultation.  <\/p> <p>  Like Deputy Naughten, I am concerned.  Thurles is the divisional headquarters for Tipperary at the moment.  I heard the case being made this morning for Ennis to be made the site of headquarters of this new area.  Geographically, that makes no sense.  It would be a completely lopsided decision.  Thurles is in the centre of Tipperary.  This proposed division is a monstrosity in terms of size.  It is 200 km from the west coast of Clare to Carrick-on-Suir.  I have met nobody operating in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in my county who thinks it logical to have this territory in the one division.  <\/p> <p>  We also have the most kilometres of motorways of any county in Ireland.  We have two motorways going through our county.  For whatever reason, one of them seems to have a serious number of crashes.  There seems to be a serious number of crashes on the stretch of motorway in the Moneygall area.  As a Tipperary Deputy and a Thurles man, I am extremely concerned about this merger.  We have been getting the short straw as regards resources.  This reorganisation will make Tipperary's position worse.  I stress that if this proposed merger of Tipperary and Clare, which is illogical, goes ahead, Thurles must be retained as the headquarters in that division due to its location.  While we would still not be happy, it would give us some confidence that Tipperary would be adequately policed.  The lack of resources in our county is of significant concern to us.  Clonmel Garda station is another issue.  We have been promised a new station there for a long time.  The conditions in which garda&iacute; in that station have to work are unacceptable and are not up to modern standards.  Due to pressure on time, I will conclude.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#Z00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

Therefore, there will be a growth in the number of personnel.<\/p><p> The geographical size of some of the divisions is an issue, but at the same time I am not expecting the chief superintendent to answer calls.  Our resources will be dispersed geographically throughout the divisions.  Therefore, garda&iacute; and sergeants will be available to answer calls for assistance and community policing.  What we are gaining is the ability to enhance community policing and our response to crime, including domestic abuse and serious sexual assaults.  Also, we will be able to create efficiencies.  Therefore, there will be more policing, not less.  Perhaps there might be a lot less access to the chief superintendent, but there will be superintendents available.  There will also be inspectors with community policing responsibilities and additional inspectors and sergeants.  There will be an additional 75 inspectors and an additional 150 sergeants.  It is good to be able to apply the additional supervision and support to this model.  People in Tipperary will see an enhanced, not a diminished, policing service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":859,"content":"<p>What about the headquarters for the division?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#AA00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":860,"content":"<p>We are in the final stages.

Obviously, the Border, Brexit and budgeting are the order of the day in the D&aacute;il.  I want to ask a few specific questions about Brexit.  There is serious concern along the Border about co-operation, particularly in the context of the sharing of information, extradition and trafficking, in the event that a deal is not struck.  Policing will be the worse for it, not just in the Border region but also across the rest of the country.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked from where the model of the divisional policing policy had come.

I welcome Commissioner Harris and the other staff members.  I am sure the delegates have heard a lot today about the new reform plan.  I wish to raise a couple of issues.  <\/p> <p>  I have grave concern about the merging of Waterford Garda division with the Carlow and Kilkenny division.  My main concerns are about Waterford being the only city in the country to be left without a divisional headquarters under the planned reforms.  From what I can see, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Dublin are receiving different treatment.  Waterford Garda station is among the five busiest in the country.  Under Project 2040, the population of Waterford is expected to grow by 30,000 in the next 20 years.  Why was there no meaningful consultation with the various bodies before the plan was announced?  Why was there no meaningful consultation with the joint policing committees, the front-line staff and the Garda associations across the country before the reforms were announced?  With the amalgamation of the Waterford and Carlow and Kilkenny divisions, it is proposed to reduce the number of divisions from six to four.<\/p> <p>  There was a large spate of burglaries in rural Waterford last week.  Seven houses were affected.  I dealt with a case in which the home of an 86 year old man had been broken into.  I highlight the absolute respect and empathy shown to the gentleman by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the garda who visited the crime scene.  The individual in question was there for hours and so respectful and helpful.  I fear that, with the dilution of services, rural parts of Waterford will be affected.  We have three great divisions - Dungarvan, Tramore and Waterford - under the auspices of the chief superintendent.  When the Commissioner is considering where the headquarters should be located, I would like him to really consider the fact that Waterford has the fifth busiest divisional headquarters in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#AA01100","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his patience.  I thank all of the garda&iacute; and staff who are present.<\/p> <p>  When I was in my office, I was listening to Assistant Commissioner Finn alluding to the proposed community garda complement of four in 40 in Cork.  I understand the current complement is three in 25.<\/p><p>I have raised this issue twice before with the Commissioner.  I wrote to him and, in fairness, received a response.  As I previously put on the record, my view is that Cork has not got a fair shake.  Since 2014, 2,800 garda&iacute; have graduated from Templemore, of whom 69, or 2.4%, have been assigned to Cork which accounts for almost 10% of the national population.  That is not good enough.  I acknowledge that it was intended for garda&iacute; from the most recent complement of graduates to be assigned to Cork, but the Commissioner decided to redirect them to Dublin and Drogheda for reasons that I understand.<\/p><p> I am conscious that there are significant challenges in Cork.  There was a big public meeting last night at which significant anger was expressed about a rise in crimes, including assaults.  There were two very serious assaults last weekend in Cork city.  It is high time for Cork to be afforded an adequate complement of garda&iacute;.  I ask the Commissioner to prioritise Cork in the allocation of garda&iacute; in November.  I know that four in 40 is the plan, but what is important is that many of them will be promoted from the ranks of ordinary garda&iacute; and those positions need to be backfilled.  I ask the Commissioner to take that on board for the November allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#AA01200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I wish to state again that I am filled with disgust at what happened yesterday evening on the Border between Cavan and Fermanagh.

It was a horrific experience for Mr. Lunney and all associated with him, especially his loved ones.

On the reform process, I am my party's spokesperson on disability rights.  I have been made aware that the Templemore training programme for new recruits does not incorporate what I would regard as disability awareness training.  Such training should not be confined to new recruits.  It is more widely needed.  As national disability spokesperson and vice chair of the Oireachtas all-party disability group, I am aware of instances when people with specific disabilities that are not immediately apparent had less than satisfactory experiences with members of the Garda.  An incident recently referred to me involved a person who has an acquired brain injury, although that is not immediately apparent in his demeanour.  He is unaware that it sounds like he is shouting when he is responding and conversing.  He was threatened with pepper spray and a baton.  That is a real case, not constructed or contrived.  I reference it only to encourage that disability awareness training in all its dimensions be incorporated into the Templemore programme and, indeed, for serving members in whatever way it can be rolled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019091800002#BB00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":872,"content":"<p>On disability awareness training, I know that certain training is undergone in Templemore, but I will ascertain the full picture and then report back to the committee, at which stage we will see what more needs to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I received member's representations on the proposed division of Waterford, Kilkenny and Carlow, but I was not able to give much comfort other than to say that a final decision has not yet been made.  It will be made shortly in consultation with my senior team.  We have carefully noted the comments made today on the issue.  On consultation, the simplest part of the change is putting lines on the map.  The next step, which will be difficult, involves local implementation.  That will be an extensive process that will require the full engagement of the organisation.  The changes were flagged long in advance by the design principles that were applied to the divisional structure and the resultant decision on the number of divisions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Now that we have reached this point, we must begin implementation, which will ensure that we provide a locally bespoke policing service that meets the requirements of local policing plans and communities.  That will be the focus going forward.  We hope that people in all areas will see an uplift in the quality of the policing service.<\/p> <p>   I visited Cork two weeks ago and many of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on distribution, particularly that of probationary garda&iacute; in June, were made during my visit.  Some rebalancing needs to be done following the distribution in June.  At the time, there were specific and very critical issues to which we had to respond.  Together with my colleagues, I took a decision on distribution.  In some ways we will have to rebalance that in the coming period.  In spite of our financial position, we will be able to recruit a further 200 garda&iacute; in December.  We plan to allocate approximately 700 garda&iacute; in the new year, depending on our financial situation.  There are plenty of individuals joining An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which, along with the recruitment of Garda staff, will make a difference to community policing teams and our overall visibility.  Roster reform is a very important part of ensuring that we have garda&iacute; available at the right times in the right places.

The local voluntary community group, known as Courceys Rural Development, CRD, was responsible for this initiative.  Each year since, an annual memorial event has been held at this first monument, at the nearest point of land to the wreck, with all the emotional resonance this engenders, until more recent developments nearby.<br\/><br\/>In 2010, CRD decided to explore the development possibilities of the nearby site of the ruinous Napoleonic signal tower.  After some initial research it was established that the title deeds to the site were held by the OPW.  No other State agency had an interest.  CRD approached the OPW and this resulted a number of years later in the granting of a 50-year lease on the 0.784 ha site surrounding the signal tower.  In 2012, CRD, with grant assistance from the Heritage Council and the West Cork Development Partnership, which at that time was the LEADER programme in the area, commissioned a baseline feasibility study on the signal tower and site.  This led to the creation of a master plan for the site as a whole, consisting of three proposed elements: first, the restoration of the ruined signal tower as a panoramic viewing point and heritage and visitors' centre; second, the creation of a Lusitania memorial garden to commemorate sensitively the tragedy of the sinking of the Lusitania with such enormous loss of innocent lives; and, third, the construction of an accredited basement Lusitania museum with associated services to tell the story of the <i>Lusitania <\/i>in all its magnificence and tragedy, with an especial emphasis on the personal stories of crew and passengers.<br\/><br\/>CRD immediately set about the first target, the restoration of the signal tower.  We continued a series of local fundraising efforts to support the large local financial contribution which we knew would be required.  We commissioned conservation architect John Greene to design the restored signal tower and to engage the other professional services needed.  We applied successfully to Cork County Council for planning permission.  We made a major capital grant application to the West Cork Development Partnership.  That application, as it happened, fell through, but within a few months F&aacute;ilte Ireland stepped into the breach with the essential grant assistance, which then allowed us to proceed to the capital tender stage.  MMD Construction (Cork) Limited won the contract and began work on the restoration of the tower in the autumn of 2014.  Members can see in our submission an image of how the tower looked in its original condition and, beneath that, an image of the restored signal tower.  We had a magnificent official opening ceremony, performed by the then Minister for Defence and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, on 7 May 2015 - we homed in on the date of 7 May in all our activities - in conjunction with the Lusitania centenary commemoration, with more than 20 <i>Lusitania <\/i>relatives present.  We opened for business the following day and have managed to remain open from March to October each year since.  From 2016 onwards we have employed people on a seasonal basis.  This year we have five employees.  We operate on a break-even, not-for-profit basis.<br\/><br\/>Other significant developments took place while all this work was in progress.  We applied to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for inclusion in the Wild Atlantic Way and were granted &quot;signature discovery point&quot; status.  On legal advice we created a company limited by guarantee with no share capital in order to carry out our business in an efficient and transparent manner.  The company is Lusitania Museum\/Old Head Signal Tower Heritage CLG, under which title we are here today.<br\/><br\/>Very early in our development planning we decided to approach Mr. Gregg Bemis, who owned the wreck of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>, to ask him very politely if he would consider donating <i>Lusitania <\/i>artefacts recently recovered during licensed diving operations carried out by diver Eoin McGarry.  That initial contact has led to a most fruitful relationship with a man whom we now consider a friend, culminating in the formal legal gifting of the wreck of the <i>Lusitania <\/i>to our company on 7 May this year.  Mr. Bemis travelled from Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives, for the occasion.  The four items pictured in our submission are <i>Lusitania <\/i>artefacts recovered in the past five or six years.<br\/><br\/>Once the signal tower had been restored, Lusitania Museum\/Old Head Signal Tower Heritage CLG, LMOH, immediately set to work on the second target, the design and creation of a sensitive Lusitania memorial garden in the sunken semicircular area to the south seaward side of the restored tower.  After a tender process, we commissioned the firm of landscape architects, Cunnane Stratton Reynolds, to design the garden.  We again applied successfully for planning permission and went to e-tender to determine a contractor.  The contract was won by Cameron Kiernan Landscaping Limited.  We decided to establish a separate process to design and commission a memorial sculpture which would be the centrepiece of the garden.  We engaged the services of the National Sculpture Factory in Cork to select the sculptors.  North Cork artists Liam Lavery and Eithne Ring were commissioned to implement their design, a 20 m curved bronze &quot;wave&quot; to contain the 1,962 names of all persons aboard the <i>Lusitania <\/i>on 7 May 1915 as well as appropriate history panels such as the 1915 Manhattan skyline.  The <i>Lusitania <\/i>had sailed from Pier 54 on 1 May 1915.  Capital grant support was again provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and this time also by Cork County Council.  The Lusitania Memorial Garden was officially opened by the then Minister for Defence on 7 May 2017, two years after we opened the signal tower, which members can see in our submission.  There was a further remarkable inclusion in the Lusitania Memorial Garden in 2018.  We became aware that a davit, which is a crane, from one of the <i>Lusitania <\/i>lifeboats had, by a series of coincidences, been standing in the Marine Park in Annalong, near Newry, for over 40 years.  After some deft political negotiations, Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, including members of every political party in the North of Ireland, unanimously agreed to gift the davit to the Lusitania Memorial Garden.  Members can see the davit in our submission.  There was a formal hand-over ceremony in the Newry council offices in June and a formal unveiling ceremony at the Old Head performed by Mr. Bemis at the end of August last year, with each of the political parties from Newry, Mourne and Down District Council represented.<\/p><p>The davit is now standing in the memorial garden, with its arm pointing towards the wreck of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>as a permanent reminder of a wonderful example of North-South co-operation.  We have recorded on a nearby plaque the unique history of the davit and the people involved in its return.  My written submission includes pictures of the wave sculpture in the garden.  A picture shows Eithne Ring, one of the artists.<br\/><br\/>The third and most ambitious target is to design and build an accredited basement <i>Lusitania<\/i>museum that will, through the public display of recovered artefacts, the use of modern multimedia methods, the design of the building and attracting by gift or loan <i>Lusitania<\/i>artefacts held at home or abroad, tell the story of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>, its crew and passengers by providing the visitor with a walk back in time to help him or her to gain an insight into the magnificence of the ship, with its state-of-the-art engineering.  Critically, it should provide an insight into some of the reasons the ship became entangled in the tragedy of the Great War, resulting in its untimely demise.  The plan would be to rival Titanic Belfast in terms of historical and heritage appeal at the beautiful, scenic, accessible and resonant location, at the highest point of the Old Head of Kinsale Peninsula on the Wild Atlantic Way, but, thankfully, not in terms of cost. <br\/><br\/>We began the third phase of the project by engaging John McLaughlin Architects Limited., at a cost of &euro;12,300, to undertake an additional architectural outline study of options for delivering the basement museum and visitor centre.  This was the third part of the original master plan.  The firm&rsquo;s report is a foundation document for the full design team tendering process which includes site analysis, a developed project brief, an order of magnitude cost estimate and an artist&rsquo;s impression of the centre.  While the <i>Lusitania<\/i>museum would be the central attraction, displaying as many artefacts as possible in a meaningful context, many other items of local interest, including an Old Head lighthouse history and artefacts, a coast guard history and artefacts, as well as local history and geology, should be accommodated.  The result of the study is shown briefly in an artist&rsquo;s impression, showing the Old Head lighthouse, a sketch of Old Head and the <i>Lusitania<\/i>Memorial Garden which comprises a circular area.  The tower is in the middle, while the museum will be to the north in an L-shaped configuration.  <br\/><br\/>The order of magnitude cost estimate for the building is approximately &euro;3 million.  This figure covers the actual building, not its fitting out, which presents a different problem.  With the study to hand, we made two major grant funding applications.  In 2018 we applied for design funding from the rural regeneration development fund under the auspices of Cork County Council.  We have not attracted any assistance so far through this vehicle.  Although the scheme makes provision for specific design funding, it seems that a policy decision was made at an early stage to fund only shovel-ready projects in the first and second allocations, which I believe have been made.<br\/><br\/>This year F&aacute;ilte Ireland launched its &euro;150 million platforms for growth 2019 to 2022 investment fund for immersive heritage and cultural attractions.  We have applied for funding under the programme and successfully passed stage 1 of an extremely competitive five stage process.  Recently we received an update on the status of the evaluation of stage 2 applications.  We are at stage 2.  We were informed that 141 submissions had been received for projects nationwide, with an indicative value of &euro;1.3 billion.  This means that only the strongest projects will be invited to proceed to stage 3.  In our case, there are additional constraints.  The ground rules prioritise the northern half of the Wild Atlantic Way.  As a voluntary community group, we will find it very difficult to compete against public bodies such as county and city councils which are making most of the applications when it comes to providing match funding in the order of 25% which we understand will be a prerequisite for success at stage 3 if we are invited to progress that far.  We will not know until about the end of November whether we will have been successful on stage 2.  We have approached SECAD, the current Leader programme that covers our part of the country, and Cork County Council to discuss possible phased funding options in advancing our plans.<br\/><br\/>In addition to all of these initiatives, we decided to engage the services of the firm Harris Coyle Breen, chartered quantity surveyors, to tender for an architect-led full design team.  We need to select a full design team for the proposed <i>Lusitania<\/i>museum and visitor centre.  That is costing us roughly &euro;6,000 from our own resources.  The tender returns are due on 25 September.  They will be evaluated and the chosen design team will be selected in the following few weeks.  When this process is complete, we will again contact SECAD and Cork County Council about phased funding.  The only way we can do this business is on a phased basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019091800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Con Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":884,"content":"<p>Generally, we keep statements to about ten minutes.

The sinking of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>, unlike that of the <i>Titanic, <\/i>was a totally man-made disaster and a deliberate act of war and, therefore, a much bigger event in world history.  It is doubtful if the full story of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>has been told.  In technical terms, it is a marvel of our times, but it also represents the social history of the era in a stark way, including a deliberate shipwreck on a grand scale with the most unlikely heroes and villains; a high level cover-up between Queenstown and London; and, remarkably, the unmasking, by its chairman, Lord Mersey, of the plan to blame Captain William Thomas Turner for the sinking at the Board of Trade inquiry.<br\/><br\/>The sinking of the <i>Lusitania <\/i>occurred in international waters, but subsequent developments in maritime law mean she is now well within Irish territorial waters.  The placing of a heritage order on the wreck site of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>by the State, through the offices of the Department, was initial recognition of the great historical importance of the ship.  One of the immediate consequences was that a licence was required through the UAU to carry out any diving mission to the <i>Lusitania<\/i>for any purpose.  Initially, the owner of the <i>Lusitania, <\/i>Mr. Bemis, agreed to work in co-operation with the UAU, even though he had to go to court to establish his ownership rights.  Matters became a little more fraught when he was initially refused a licence to retrieve artefacts and again had to go to court to establish his right to retrieve such artefacts.  These events represented a poor beginning to the relationship between Mr. Bemis and the State.  That was a pity because Mr. Bemis has great passion for the heritage and history of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>, as proved by the enormous investment of time and money he has made in it for nearly half a century.  We have no doubt that the representatives of the State who deal with Mr. Bemis are equally committed and understand the relationship has improved significantly in recent times. <br\/><br\/>We approached Mr. Bemis in ignorance of most of this background, simply because we were equally committed to bringing the story of the <i>Lusitania <\/i>to life, especially through recovered artefacts.  When we first contacted Mr. Bemis, we had no money and nothing at all of a physical nature done at the signal tower site.  We were articulating a vision based on voluntary local action.  Perhaps that intrigued him.  In any case, our relationship developed into one of trust and friendship to the extent that he decided that he would gift us the wreck of the <i>Lusitania,<\/i>a remarkable act of generosity in all of the circumstances.  Therefore, by accident of history, the people are now the custodians of a priceless piece of historical heritage in the form of the wreck of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>.  It is time to make a new beginning to bring Mr. Bemis&rsquo; vision to fruition by acting together in order that future generations of home-grown and foreign visitors can get a flavour of this remarkable maritime heritage and history.  We believe the State should take the initiative in this new beginning by formally honouring Mr. Bemis for the work he has done - that is one of our requests to the committee - to keep knowledge of the <i>Lusitania <\/i>alive and for his generosity in bequeathing it to an Irish local voluntary group.<br\/><br\/>While we are determined and willing to pursue every available funding avenue in regard to the proposed museum and visitor centre, perhaps because of the unique nature of this historic treasure the State should consider our third phase as worthy of special treatment, whereby we would not have to compete against much stronger entities for funding.  We hope we have shown and are continuing to show just how deep our commitment is in what we have done so far.Mr. Bemis is deeply committed to investigating the cause of the second explosion.  This will require active intervention in the form of a licence, as opposed to the passive intervention involved in artefact recovery.  The last few weeks of August and early September were very busy on the wreck of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>.  Under licence, a team of highly qualified and expert divers has been surveying the wreck and recording all of its details in a baseline study of its current status and also identifying a large number of retrievable artefacts.  Mr. Eoin McGarry and his team have a licence to retrieve the ship's compass, which would be another priceless artefact to display.  The English humorist Terry Pratchett stated, &quot;A vital ingredient in making a success of a project is not to be fully aware that what you are attempting is impossible.&quot;  In that spirit, we advance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019091800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Con Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":886,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hayes for his statement.

We have spent almost &euro;20,000 on the third phase of our project to create the Lusitania museum on the Old Head.  We are engaging the services of quantity surveyors to select a design team with us, which we expect to be done by the end of this year.  That we can select a team does not necessarily mean that we can commission it, however.  We cannot do so until we have the funding required.  If we can get enough funding from SECAD and Cork County Council, though, we will be able to commission the design team to design the museum.  Our estimate of the initial amount of that funding is between &euro;70,000 and &euro;90,000.  That is the next stumbling block.  If we are successful with funding, we will commission the design team almost immediately.  It could possibly be in January or February depending on what happens in the meantime.  We believe that SECAD and Cork County Council will look favourably on helping us to fund that stage of the project.  It is a vital stage.  If we could agree a design next year, we could go to planning, which would be the next major hurdle to cross.  If all goes well, that side of the project could be completed in approximately 12 or 14 months' time.<\/p> <p>  Afterwards, the big issue will be capital funding.  From where will we get that funding?  Unless we get some, we will be stuck at that point.  If we could access capital funding through the RRDF or F&aacute;ilte Ireland, we would go to tender to select contractors.  We are in 2019.  In 2020, most of the paperwork would be out of the way.  If everything went smoothly, we could go to tender by the middle of 2021.  If we were able to select a contractor, the museum could be built by the end of 2022.  That is the timeframe within which we would like to see actions happening.

The diving licensing process this year has been between the underwater archaeology unit of the Department, Mr. Bemis and the divers who are seeking licences.  We have not applied for a licence.  It is an open question as to whether we will do so.  It is very important that the process be sped up.  It is frustrating for divers to organise hiring a ship, which may cost &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000, arrange for divers from all over the world and get organised, but then find that they still do not know in June or July whether they will receive the licence for which they applied in December.  The timing of the licences is an issue.  Last year, the process worked quite well and the divers obtained licences within a reasonable timeframe.  That may be because the relationship between the divers and the Department has improved and they know one another far better.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Bemis's intention to gift us the <i>Lusitania <\/i>has, in some ways, changed the dynamic of the situation because there had been a lot of mistrust between them.  With the gifting of the vessel to the Old Head Signal Tower Heritage CLG\/Lusitania Museum, it is to be hoped that there will be a different perception such that this is seen as a national treasure.  That is how it should be regarded.  We would welcome anything the committee can do to push the message that this is a national treasure and that we need to do something about it.  The licensing is one aspect that could be addressed.<br\/><br\/>I do not know what influence the committee has on the funding we receive.  We would love it if the Department were to give us &euro;10 million to look after the <i>Lusitania<\/i>, but the committee will not easily persuade it to do so.  As the Senator stated, a local community group can do things that even Governments may not be able to because we are on the ground, we know what has to be done and we are willing to do it.  If we do not have the expertise, we find it and keep the project moving.  We are singularly focused on what we are doing.  Any help the committee can provide would be more than welcome, beginning with positivity and getting the message across.<br\/><br\/>It would be fantastic if the committee could find a way to honour Mr. Bemis because he has done remarkable work in keeping this alive.  We have been conscious of it on the Old Head for a long time.  I began by referring to 1995, which is quite some time ago.  It has always been in the consciousness of people on the Old Head that this magnificent liner was torpedoed 12 miles off the coast.  Honouring Mr. Bemis would be a very good first move.  For that to be done in an effective manner, a licence should be issued to investigate the cause of the second explosion, which caused the ship to sink.  Mr. Bemis would consider that very important.  He would probably not accept an honorary award recognition without a furtherance of the examination of the ship.  He discussed it with the Minister and the Department because it would involve cutting plates out of one side and going in while it is still structurally sound to investigate the interior of the forward part of the ship, where the explosions that sank it occurred.  That kind of information is necessary to complete the historical record of exactly what happened to the <i>Lusitania<\/i>.  Can the facts be established without such an investigation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019091800002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Con Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":910,"content":"<p>The Senator stated that the project is not well known.

Up to 2017, we had approximately 12,000 visitors.  They were mainly Irish.  There has been a steady increase over the intervening years.  We have also seen more visitors from Europe.  Visitors from North America are very attracted to us because they believe the sinking of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>was one of the main reasons the United States entered the First World War.  Over the past two years, our visitor numbers have increased from 1,600 to almost 5,000 this year.  They are coming from all parts of the world.  As I said, in 2017 visitors were mainly coming from Ireland, England and mainland Europe, with the occasional American.  They are now coming from Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.  They all have an Irish connection.  They are coming back to visit relatives and friends.  The Wild Atlantic Way is also bringing many visitors in our direction.  Kinsale is a visitor destination and we are only a ten-minute drive from Kinsale.  The word is getting out in Kinsale and it is bringing people out just that little bit further to take in the scenery and to be amazed at what we have to show the visitor in respect of the history of the <i>Lusitania<\/i>.

I thank them for taking the time to travel up from west Cork.  They have had major success at a time when our heritage sector has taken an enormous hit across the board.  Even within the area of culture, arts, and heritage, heritage bore the brunt of funding cuts over recent years.  The abolition of the Heritage Council was mooted.  It once received &euro;19 million from the State, it now receives &euro;3 million.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland now fills that role and it seems the Heritage Council has had to take the back seat.  Despite this, a report on the heritage sector in 2011 said that it generates &euro;1.5 billion, returns &euro;500 million to the Exchequer and sustains 40,000 jobs.  I know Mr. Cole has talked about the tourism benefit but I also listened to Mr. Hayes speaking about how it is not desirable to overwhelm the Old Head.  In my contribution, I want to make the point that it is vital that we do not simplify our heritage to increase its appeal to tourists.  We should not force local groups to go through F&aacute;ilte Ireland and to justify spending on our heritage on the basis of bed nights and so on.  Going down the F&aacute;ilte Ireland route rather than using the set agency that already exists, the Heritage Council, is wrong.  Investment decisions should never be based solely on visitor numbers and bed nights.  The representatives have proven in their contributions that our built heritage is not only an enormous contributor and valuable to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which is why it funded the work, but is, first and foremost, a public good and is valuable in and of itself.  It is also valuable to the local communities who guard it.

People have compared it with the<i>Titanic<\/i>, which is in much better condition than the <i>Lusitania<\/i>because it is in much deeper water that is not subject to the variations of weather in the Atlantic.  The <i>Lusitania<\/i>is in very shallow water and, therefore, artefacts can become covered over.  The artefacts from the Spanish Armada were hard to find because they were under sand, which could happen in a very short time with the <i>Lusitania<\/i>.  As the wreck collapses in on itself some artefacts could be lost because of that fact alone.<br\/><br\/>There is another factor that should not be dismissed too easily.  It was technically very difficult to dive on the <i>Lusitania<\/i>until relatively recently.  Now there are hundreds of professional divers who would have no problem diving on the <i>Lusitania<\/i>.  There is potential for artefacts to be stolen but I will not make that a big issue.  The <i>Lusitania<\/i>is vulnerable.  There is a lot of focus on the <i>Lusitania<\/i>but nobody could protect it from that kind of stuff.<br\/><br\/>The window of opportunity to dive is in July, August and September, usually, and maybe June too if conditions are good.  Access is very weather dependent and one usually only gets two or three days at a time.  A lot of the time one has a ship commissioned that one cannot use but one must still pay for.  This year the ship that the divers commissioned cost &euro;15,000.  They had a licence to dive eight days but only dived on six, which was very good.  Unfortunately, two days were lost because the weather was not good enough.  Divers need flexibility in terms of early licensing so that they can plan their timeframe and reach the site when the weather conditions are good.  In the past there was a problem with licences being issued at the last second but it is less of a problem now.<br\/><br\/>There needs to be a more generous approach to the retrieval of artefacts.  To be fair, there was a certain resistance to retrieving anything from the <i>Lusitania<\/i>at one stage.  I am not sure what the rationale for that was but it does not make much sense to us.  It seems to me we would have no problem retrieving artefacts from the <i>Armada<\/i>vessels.  If somebody found them we would not say, &quot;leave them there&quot; but &quot;bring them up&quot; because they would be made of material that does not rust.  A lot of the artefacts that we are interested in are made of brass and non-ferous materials so they will recover almost all of their original lustre when they are cleaned up.  The formal process is a critical part of the licensing process whereby one must explain how one will recover and restore artefacts.  All of that kind of stuff is covered.  <br\/><br\/>The next ten years is crucial in terms of identifying and recovering artefacts.  Hundreds of artefacts could be recovered from the ship.  I do not know how many artefacts were identified this year but there is probably between 30 and 40 artefacts.  Divers take photographs and identify the items.  Members can see pictures on their screens of one or two items that divers have identified this year.  One of the ship's bells is still buried in the sand.  This year, a licence was issued for the ship's compass.  I am not sure whether Mr. Eoin McGarry has dived at the site this year.  I hope he has because the weather was so good.  There is an issue with the timing and speed of granting a licence.  <br\/><br\/>People need financial support.  The divers do amazing work and fund themselves to dive on the <i>Lusitania<\/i>on our behalf.  Again, we need a little bit of generosity from the State.

I appeal to the Department in the most serious way to take this project on board and deal with it now because there is no point putting it on the long finger.  All of this good work could be in vain.  For example, we heard Mr. Hayes refer to trying to track things down and if people take things, it is not very easy to get them back.  Ms McLaughlin had a story about Hugh Lane and the valuable paintings.  There is an awful lot at stake here.<\/p><p>A matter I wish to clarify relates to the site where the museum will be built.

It is a 4.5 km route.  It is expected that it will cost in the region of &euro;34 million.  It is a very large project and it will have a major impact on taking traffic out of the town of Ardee, which is choked with traffic.  I understand hundreds of lorries pass through the town daily so it is hugely important to everybody.  Significant concern has been expressed as to the future of the project.  In view of that, I undertook, as Chairman, to invite our guests to come before the committee today so that we can have absolute clarity on this road, which is of vital importance to the community of Ardee, County Louth, and in terms of the entire road network.  I invite Mr. Walsh to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019091800002#C00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":985,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members for the invitation to attend.  I am TII's director of capital programme management.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Geraldine Fitzpatrick, TII's head of the roads capital programme.  With us is Joan Martin, the chief executive of Louth County Council.<\/p> <p>  It is my understanding that the committee wishes to discuss the N52 Ardee bypass project.  I welcome the opportunity to affirm TII's commitment to the project and provide clarity on the status of the N52 Ardee bypass and the manner in which Louth County Council will be progressing the project with support and funding from TII.<\/p> <p>  The Ardee bypass  is needed to alleviate high levels of traffic congestion and remove, from the urban environment, heavy commercial vehicles that do not need to be in that environment.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the scheme is expressed in the Project Ireland 2040 national development plan where the N52 Ardee bypass is named as a strategic investment priority for the period 2018 to 2027 to improve accessibility to the north west.  I have appended an extract from the national development plan to the copies of this opening statement.<\/p> <p>  The N52 scheme obtained planning approval from Louth County Council in 2005 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la approved the compulsory purchase order for the required land in 2006.  A map of the approved scheme is also appended to the copies of this statement.  Land acquisition commenced in 2007.  Unfortunately, the economic crisis that followed meant that it was not possible to provide the funding for the construction of the scheme at that time.  Following the mid-term review of the Building on Recovery - Infrastructure Capital Investment Plan 2016 to 2021, a commitment was given to the provision of funding through 2019, 2020 and 2021.  Even though the first of the funding was for 2019, the commitment allowed reactivation of the scheme at the end of 2017.<\/p> <p>  In January 2018, Louth County Council provided the preliminary overall plan as part of monthly updates to councillors and to members of the public on request.  As a result of the information provided, which included drawings of the scheme, residents from the Mullenstown-Coole community  convened public meetings in April 2018.  At those meetings, concerns were expressed about the impacts that the scheme might have on local traffic movements.  I would like to acknowledge the work done by a number of elected representatives, including the Chairman, in bringing these concerns to the attention of Louth County Council and TII last year.  Through the months of May, June and July 2018, meetings were held and detailed submissions from residents groups were received by Louth County Council and TII.  Of particular concern is the closure of the Townspark Road west of the new bypass and the closure of the Mullanstown Road east, that is, on the Ardee town side of the new bypass, and the consequences of these closures.  A point made in all of the submissions was that the residents did not wish to delay the construction of the N52 bypass.  In the past year, Louth County Council, with the support of TII, has been working to find a way of addressing the issues raised within the limitations of the scheme&rsquo;s planning permission and within the acquired land.  This was in order not to delay the construction of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The design of the scheme was completed in 2004.  The design is safe and compliant with design standards and the bypass would have been built in 2008 if the funding was available.  However, there have been significant changes since then such as the construction of a number of additional houses, the growth in membership and activity in Ardee Celtic football club, Sean McDermott&rsquo;s GAA club and Ardee rugby club.  These changes in the local area and an increased commitment by TII to meeting the needs of vulnerable road users, coupled with an increase in walking and cycling, creates different desirable outcomes to be achieved by the design.<\/p> <p>  In September of 2018, Louth County Council identified a number of options for possible changes to the junctions on the scheme.  All of the options require an amendment of the planning permission and the provision of additional land if they are to be progressed.<\/p><p>On 29 August, Louth County Council sought TII approval to commence the tender competition for the construction of the 2004 design that complies with the planning permission and fits within the acquired land.  Local residents had indicated support for this progression to construction on condition that there was a commitment from TII and Louth County Council that subsequent amendments to the junctions, if found to be warranted, would be the subject of a separate and subsequent planning procedure.  As director of capital programmes for TII, it is my responsibility to consider this request.  It had become clear over the course of the interaction with the residents that the issues raised would have to be addressed.  I decided not to grant that approval and I requested Louth County Council to undertake a review of the scheme design in advance of progressing to construction.<\/p><p> As the Chairman will be aware, TII's obligation as sanctioning authority under the public spending code is to ensure that value for money is achieved by \"doing the right thing and doing it right\".  I understand that the review of the original scheme will delay the project by 12 to 18 months.  However, this review has the potential to incorporate significant benefits such as better community connectivity, infrastructure to cope with increases in walkers and cyclists, improved access for sporting facilities and required adaptation for climate change.<\/p><p> Louth County Council has suggested that a non-statutory public consultation process would be undertaken.  This will allow for contributions from all stakeholders, including residents in the wider Ardee community, sports clubs, public transport providers, organisations that provide services to this area such as An Post, school bus operators and local businesses.  I am confident that any additional costs incurred in improving the scheme will be offset by the additional benefits.  I will hand over to Louth County Council's chief executive, Ms Joan Martin, who will outline what the next steps in the process of delivering the N52 bypass of Ardee will involve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019091800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1568761200,"counter":987,"content":"<p>As has been said, our first priority is preparing and organising the public consultation events.

I thank Louth County Council and TII for bringing the bypass to this stage and I welcome the news that there is a commitment to see the project through.  I agree with the opening statement.  Ardee is congested.  It was congested 20 years ago, hence the need for the bypass, which will be needed more than ever if Ardee-mid-Louth is to progress.  I strongly disagree with the announcement of a review or what could be a review of one of the largest projects in the history of County Louth.<\/p> <p>  Traffic congestion in Ardee also has economic and social consequences.  We are right in the middle of two of the largest towns in Ireland - Dundalk and Drogheda.  When completed, this bypass will have great benefits for traders, as it is anticipated that there will be much more footfall with less traffic congestion.  We are also in the middle of a significant spend on Ardee Castle, which will enhance tourism, and the last thing we need is to have a launch and for visitors to be then stuck in endless traffic.  The committee and the Department will be well aware that this bypass is needed.  I think even the committee will agree that a wait of 20 years is far too long for a small town that is doing everything it can to survive economically and socially.  I praise the Ardee Traders and Business Association for all its efforts to make Ardee a great place in which to work, shop and play.  These people need some help.  This is an opportunity for the committee to get it over the line.  We have a duty to ensure this bypass continues for the greater good.  <\/p> <p>  The Ardee bypass is a must-have, not a maybe.  It is a long overdue investment in the quality of life of the people of Ardee.  It will be of significant value to the health and well-being of the people of town by reducing the extensive carbon and other toxic pollution that results from the major traffic flows using the town at present.  Given the Government's carbon efficiency targets, surely we must put the people first and, in this instance, bypass Ardee.  The investment in the Ardee bypass must not come down to a rural versus urban trade-off.  Rural Ireland demands this investment to add to the economic well-being of Ardee and the wider area.  This is an opportunity to put people first in our planning and budget spend proposal.  We need to reduce the sense of social exclusion being felt in Ardee because of the continuous traffic problems and minimal public infrastructure.  We must see Ardee as an opportunity centre that can develop with the help of a bypass into a vibrant economic hub for rural Louth.  I fully understand and support the Townparks Road issue and hope we can find a solution without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019091800002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Dolores Minogue"},{"type":"speech","time":1568761200,"counter":995,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

I thank the representatives from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the county manager of Louth County Council and the chairman of Ardee municipal council for their presentation.  It speaks for itself with regard to the issues that arise.  It is important to welcome the concerned residents from the area.<\/p> <p>  I was a member of Louth County Council when the plan in question was adopted.  Everybody hailed it at the time as a great project and some believed it might not happen.  We have moved to a stage where money has been committed for it.  The community, particularly in Ardee and its hinterland, welcome that and want to see the project completed.<\/p><p>To be fair, Louth County Council had a shovel ready project when the money was made available.<\/p><p> It is clear from the written presentation I have read that Transport Infrastructure Ireland is committed to the project.  Reference has been made to the fact that the project was adopted in 2005 and that many things have changed in the vicinity of the proposed bypass since.  As I said to several people before the meeting, I joined the council in 1991.  Road developments, particularly of this nature, need to be cognisant of rural communities.  In fact, I had prior dealings with Transport Infrastructure Ireland on two specific projects, one of which involved the provision of an underpass at Killkerly on the main M1 motorway that preventing the break-up of the parish community of Killkerly and Knockbridge.  Subsequently, there was a problem on the N52 on the outskirts of Dundalk which was dividing Haggardstown and Blackrock, but a compromise was found by way of the provision of traffic lights, about which many complain to this day, including me.  However, the important point is that the communities were facilitated to the best possible degree.  The engagement that took place with the local authority is what helped us to find a solution, certainly in the case of the first junction.  My specific question is: did it require having to go back to the drawing board?  I firmly believe it did not and that we were reaching a compromise in the case of the second junction at Mullenstown.  Ultimately, on a point referred to by Councillor Minogue, there is an interdependence between the people living in the urban area who want to see the project happen yesterday and the rural community who must also be taken into account.<\/p><p> This has been a live debate since the money was allocated.  Concerns were raised about flooding which I understand were addressed by the diligent engineers of Louth County Council, with whom I have been proactively involved.  I would like to see the project going ahead.  The message needs to be sent loud and clear and I think I can speak for all public representatives and politicians of one hue or another within the constituency.  No one wants anything other than what has been proposed at the two junctions and the issues are resolvable.  The residents who have legitimate concerns are as anxious as anybody to see the project go ahead.  I am not sure whether it is possible within the law, but we should stick to the confines of the proposal, even if there has to be compulsory purchase or there are other issues.<\/p><p> I understand the Chairman has tried to express a fear that we could lose the project, but that is not my reading of what Mr. Walsh said.  I would like Mr. Walsh to confirm that no Government, regardless of whether the Government changes in the next 12 months, will change the fact that it is a live project and that, when the costings are made, it will be reviewed and be a rolling project.  If delays into 2020 are inevitable, which is what Mr. Walsh seems to be saying, it is incumbent on all local public representatives and those dealing with the project to row in behind it to ensure the concerns are dealt with.

To say the congestion is worsening in Ardee is an understatement, but there is a still a concern, although I know that Mr. Walsh has provided clarification on the commitment given and the fact that the project is included in the national development plan.  On the point raised by Mr. Walsh and Ms Martin about the compulsory purchase order if additional land is required for the project, they said they hoped the scheme would go to tender by the end of 2020.  I hope that will happen, but if there were to be challenges, what would the timeframe be?

That first process will obviously have to be undertaken through a public consultation process to listen to people and look at the technical issues involved.  We will then decide on the best technical option, but until we get to that stage, we have no idea which of the options identified it is going to be.  For some of them considerably more land would be required than for others.  In the case of some of them, the land is tight around the junction, while in the case of others, it is nearly like a new road is being built to link a number of junctions.  There are different options on the table.  When we get to the stage where a decision is made on the option to be brought forward, obviously, it will have to be mapped and designed, laid out and approved before we can commence the Part 8 planning approval process.  We are moving along in chunks of time.  This is unavoidable as we have to undergo these stages.  The Part 8 planning approval process normally takes no more than three or four months.

We are always very careful to try to ensure we do everything correctly in accordance with the law.  The process takes about four months, depending on the dates and times of council meetings and so on.  The Chairman knows how it works.  We always try to do things in parallel.  As Transport Infrastructure Ireland pointed out, there are ongoing contracts and the diversion work will continue.  They are all moving ahead; therefore, the scheme is progressing insofar as it can.

In many ways, it is a question of how long is a piece of string but we have a lot of staff in TII and in the council who are very familiar with all these processes.  We will be streamlining and working in parallel to minimise the delays.  Nobody is more disappointed than the engineers in Louth County Council, some of whom have worked on this scheme from day one.  Indeed, I was involved with it myself at the very start, as a director in the roads section.  We are as anxious as everybody else to see it proceed and we will leave no stone unturned to streamline and speed up the process as much as we can.  With a fair wind and a bit of luck, we could be out to tender by the end of 2020, if not a little before then, although I would not like to be over optimistic about it and make promises that we cannot fulfil.  We will certainly move it along in parallel and as quickly as possible.  I assure everybody of our ongoing commitment to doing that.  It is a high priority for Louth County Council and a strategic objective of our plan as well as of the national plan.

The Ardee bypass project has been on the agenda for a very long time.  It is situated on the N52 and runs for 4.5 km.  Funding of &euro;34 million has been allocated and the people of Ardee, including shop owners, cannot wait for it to happen.  In 2005 planning permission was granted, in 2006 a CPO was published for the land and in 2007, the land was acquired.  Then suddenly we had the economic crash and there was no money to go ahead.  I do not know how the witnesses can guarantee that this will go ahead in 2020.  The opening statement refers to the economic situation in the past but let us look at the current economic situation.  It has never been so unstable.  We have Brexit looming and nobody knows what is going on.  Billions of euro are being spent on the national children's hospital and will be spent on the national broadband plan.  I cannot see how the witnesses can appear before this committee today and state, categorically, that the money will be made available for this project.  I just cannot understand how they can give that kind of commitment.  The people of Ardee, many of whom are listening in to these proceedings today, have been waiting for a very long time for this.  To be honest, this Government is probably in the most insecure situation that we have seen for a very long time.<\/p> <p>  The witness from TII referred to contributions from all stakeholders, including the residents of the wider Ardee community but did they not make submissions previously?

Why, when the money has been allocated and Louth County Council is ready to start the project, are we now in turmoil?  There will be no one more disappointed than me if this does not go ahead but the witness does not have the right to tell people that this is going to happen.  This might never happen because nobody knows what the situation will be in 12 months.  Back in 2005, when everything was going so well, everyone thought this project was going to happen.

This review is needed on the basis of issues brought to our attention by elected representatives and the genuine concerns of local residents that connectivity of the local community will be negatively impacted.  The engagement between Louth County Council and those groups, and the detailed submissions received from them, pointed to the changes that had occurred in the time since planning approval was granted in 2005 and raised issues that needed to be addressed.  The idea that we would proceed with a project over which there were significant question marks in terms of whether changes needed to be made would fly in the face of our obligations under the public spending code to ensure we do what is right and do so correctly.  We need to ensure this is the right project for this reason, and the forthcoming consultation in Louth is an effort to do that.  The reason I mentioned bodies such as An Post, school bus services and so on was to provide some reassurance that the submissions received had been noted.

That became a protracted issue.<\/p> <p>  It is a pity this took so long to come to a head.  Instead of moving a mountain to fill a valley, does TII, in its construction programme, consider tunnels, or flyovers on stilts, as opposed to ploughing through areas?  People have spoken about floods but we do not need a land bank going through the entire bog.  Would people compromise if it was built on stilts and there was a flyover for the bog area?
