I welcome this opportunity to present the SIA to the committee today.  As in previous years, a rigorous assessment has been undertaken to examine the implications for Ireland of the potential fishing opportunities for the year ahead.  The past few years, as we know, have been particularly challenging for our fishing industry.  In addition to the continuing fuel crisis, the impact of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and the quota transfers under the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, TCA, are still having an effect.  I assure the Chairperson that I as Minister and the Government continue to keep the focus on the disproportionate quota reductions for Ireland under the TCA and to use any and every opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.  I am keeping a strong focus on the matter within the Fisheries Council and making it clear that the TCA transfers must be addressed within the EU.<\/p> <p>  The UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU has also led to significant changes to the processes involved in setting total allowable catches, TACs, for the majority of our commercial fish stocks.  Approximately 40 of Ireland&rsquo;s fish stocks, which were previously exclusively European Union resources, are now shared resources, most shared with the UK.  The Commission has the sole competence to negotiate with third countries on behalf of the EU for the setting of fishing opportunities for shared stocks.  Unfortunately, the UK now counts as a third country.  The bilateral negotiations between the Commission, on behalf of the EU, and the UK are due to begin in November and I will go into more detail on these consultations in a moment.  Based on the experience of the last year post Brexit and the changes, this has led to in the procedures for setting fishing opportunities for the EU, I decided that the SIA process should commence at the start of October rather than later to be as relevant as possible.  The SIA is an essential step in Ireland&rsquo;s preparation for the TAC setting process and I want to have the process completed before we commence the EU-UK consultations.  Carrying out the process at this stage allows for input from stakeholders, analysis by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Marine Institute and the views of the Oireachtas in time for the start of the TAC setting process.  As the Chair outlined, I am joined by two representatives, Dr. Ciaran Kelly from the Marine Institute, who is a scientific expert, and Mr. Dominic Rihan, a socioeconomic impact expert from Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  As the Chair outlined, Ms Josephine Kelly and Dr. Cecil Beamish from my own team are also in attendance.<\/p> <p>  I decided to again use the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES's, scientific advice as the basis for this year&rsquo;s SIA.  The ICES advice forms the basis of the scientific advice used by the Commission.  The ICES gathers scientific advice; its advice for the relevant stock provides suitable guidance for the TAC figures which would normally be proposed by the Commission.  This allowed for a meaningful public consultation and for realistic engagement with our stakeholders.  It allowed the Marine Institute and BIM to produce the biological and socioeconomic impact assessments to inform us.  The waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  We have a duty of care and a national self-interest to protect their biological richness and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  The landing obligation, which aims to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding fish, has been fully implemented since 2019.  The practical application of the landing obligation has been challenging for operators, requiring changes in fishing practices and behaviour.  However, my Department along with BIM continue to work together with fishers to adapt and develop the most selective and sustainable fishing methods.  The efforts and commitment of our fishers in this matter have been and remain important.<\/p> <p>  Another key feature of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is the setting of TACs and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield.  Fishing at maximum sustainable yield, FMSY, is the largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions.  Of course, in the past, a failure to fish at FMSY and a failure also to have the scientific assessment that we so rely on led to overfishing in some instances of stocks and a depletion of stocks.  It is important for sustainable stocks every year going forward that we do not take any more from that stock than would undermine its health and the size of the stock so that the fish will be there next year and the year after.  Progress is being achieved in terms of the sustainability of fish stocks.  For 2022, 38 stocks of interest to Ireland have been fished below maximum sustainable yield.  In 2013, only 20 stocks were fished at this sustainable level.  It is now up at 38 from 20 back in 2013.  The number of stocks overfished is 15 in 2022, down from 22 in previous years.  This is a significant achievement and Ireland will continue to work with stakeholders, the Commission, other member states and third countries to build on this tangible progress to achieve our objectives of healthy fish stocks and sustainable fishing.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to take this opportunity to update the committee on the upcoming report by the European Commission on the functioning of the CFP.  Under the CFP regulation, the European Commission is required to report to the European Parliament and the European Council on the functioning of the CFP by the end of this year.<\/p><p>The Commission has indicated that its report on the functioning of the CFP will take the form of a communication, analysing the dimensions of the CFP and looking at the interaction between fisheries management and the objectives of the European Green Deal.  In addition, the communication will address the social dimension of the CFP and consider how to improve the delivery of the CFP policy objectives.  I have consistently made clear the Government&rsquo;s assessment that the substantial changes brought about in fisheries policy as a result of the TCA, requires that a comprehensive review of the CFP be carried out within the EU to support changes to deliver a fair and equitable policy.<br\/><br\/>Earlier this year, I established a national Common Fisheries Policy review group, bringing together relevant stakeholders to examine the issues that arise for Ireland in the context of the CFP review; to advise me on priorities for the negotiations; and importantly, to identify strategies most likely to influence the outcome of the review.  The group was chaired by Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who was assisted by a steering committee comprising Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinneide, former director of the Marine Institute and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; and Mr. Donal Maguire, former director of BIM.  I thank the three of them and all stakeholders for their work.<br\/><br\/>The group involved representatives of all key stakeholders, including industry representative groups, fisheries representatives and the environmental NGOs.  That review group submitted its final report to me on 5 August 2022.  The stakeholders have set out a number of recommendations on aspects of the CFP that need to be addressed to adapt to the monumental changes of recent years and ensure a sustainable future for the sector.<br\/><br\/>I have forwarded a copy of the report to the EU fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkeviius, who is responsible for the CFP review.  I have made clear that I am fully satisfied that our stakeholders&rsquo; report demonstrates the need for legislative changes in the current policy to address the disproportionate impacts of the TCA on Ireland in the context of the new environmental challenges we are facing.  I have asked him to review the report's findings and recommendations and consider how these can be taken forward to support a fair and balanced CFP.<br\/><br\/>I will now touch on the EU-UK consultations that are a key step in moving forward the quota negotiations for next year.  The bilateral consultations with the UK for 2023 for shared stocks are due to begin at the start of November.  The SIA process and the committee's input today will help to develop Ireland&rsquo;s position during the upcoming negotiations.  The negotiations will be led by the European Commission on behalf of all member states.  I and my team will be fully engaged at EU level to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are recognised and pursued with Commissioner Sinkeviius and his team.  We are hopeful that agreement can be reached in time to allow the outcome to be discussed at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 12 and 13 December 2022 and feed into the TAC and quotas regulation for 2023.<br\/><br\/>I will insist that the Hague preferences are applied at the December council for the relevant fish stocks.  However, if an EU-UK agreement is not secured, a contingency plan is in place to ensure fishing can continue at the start of 2023 without interruption.  Under the Trade and Co-operation Agreement, in the event that agreement with the UK cannot be reached by 20 December, the TCA provides for each party to set provisional TACs applying from 1 January at the scientific level advised by ICES.  In previous years, the Commission developed a plan for provisional TACs for the first three months of the year.  This saw TACs for most stocks set at 25% of the previous year&rsquo;s TAC level, with the full TAC applied for coastal state stocks such as mackerel and blue whiting, which are seasonal, at the start of the year.  While this situation is not ideal, it will provides certainty and continuity for the fishing industry in the New Year, if needed.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to management arrangements for three migratory species in the north east Atlantic in which we have an interest.  They are blue whiting, atlanto-scandian herring and mackerel.  The arrangements for these are negotiated by means of a coastal states framework between the parties in whose waters significant concentrations of these stocks are to be found and that have normally had a track record in fishing them.  The coastal states negotiations for 2023 commenced last week in London.  Agreement was reached on setting the TACs for atlanto-scandian herring at 511,000 tonnes.  The EU, and Ireland, have a relatively small share of this stock.  It is also likely that the coastal states will agree on setting the TAC for mackerel at 782,000 tonnes in line with the ICES advice, although this has not been finalised yet.<br\/><br\/>The ICES advice is based on the FMSY approach and represents a reduction of 2% compared to last year's TAC.  The TAC for blue whiting has not yet been agreed.  ICES calls for an 81% increase but the coastal states are continuing discussions as there is divergence of opinion as to whether all the increase should be applied.  The 2014 sharing arrangement for mackerel between the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands expired at the end of 2020.  Discussions aimed at reaching a new agreement on a new sharing arrangement for mackerel began earlier this year and are ongoing.  I have been clear on the need to agree a sharing arrangement for mackerel that respects the EU and, in turn, Ireland&rsquo;s proper share of the global TAC.<br\/><br\/>We continue to oppose the setting of unacceptably high unilateral quotas for mackerel by a number of third countries.  I have articulated our concerns about what has happened over the past two years, in particular at the EU fisheries Council and directly to Commissioner Sinkeviius.  If this unacceptable behaviour is continued in 2023 by these countries, the EU must work together and use all available tools to ensure real and effective consequences for such behaviour.  The coastal state parties have also committed to begin discussions for new sharing arrangements for atlanto-scandian herring and blue whiting early in 2023.<br\/><br\/>I will move on to the SIA.  In order for the SIA to be carried out, the ICES scientific advice for the stocks was used as a basis for the assessment.  As part of the assessment, an open consultation process was initiated, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the ICES advice for fish stocks for next year; and on the European Commission&rsquo;s communication, Towards more sustainable fishing in the EU: state of play and orientations for 2023. and its accompanying staff working document.  An online web portal at<i><\/i><i><\/i>was activated on 12 October to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  Two submissions to the public consultation were received.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline will be published on the website.  In addition to the written submissions, I convened a meeting of stakeholders including fishing industry representatives and environmental NGOs last week on 20 October.  The purpose of the meeting was to give a further opportunity to representatives to outline their positions on the many aspects of the communication and on the scientific advice.  I thank all the stakeholders for their contributions to the impact assessment.<br\/><br\/>The stakeholders set out a range of positions. However, there were also many commonalities.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed through the consultation process, which, as a whole, I consider to have the same objective of sustainable fishing and the protection of our fishing resource and our marine ecosystem.  There is a clear call for adherence to the advice on setting TACs in accordance with FMSY.  We must also make use of the provisions of the western waters multi-annual plan to deal with stocks where scientific advice indicates the stock is in poor shape.  In recent years, to reduce catches of depleted stocks in mixed fisheries, TACs were set as by-catch only, at levels that help the biomass of these vulnerable stocks to recover to sustainable levels.  These were complemented by remedial technical measures in the Celtic Sea, the west of Scotland and Irish Sea.  The Marine Institute and BIM made invaluable contributions to the assessment of the ICES advice, which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment before the committee today.  I will briefly set out the findings contained in that assessment.<br\/><br\/>From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute&rsquo;s view, which coincides with the ICES view, is that the status of some fish stocks has improved, which is welcome.  However, others remain a concern.  In the impact assessment, the Marine Institute summarises the pressure on the 75 stocks that will be dealt with in the 2022 stock book and compares this assessment with the same evaluation presented in previous years&rsquo; stock books.  The number of stocks being fished in a sustainable manner has increased to 38.  In terms of percentages, this is an increase to 51%.  The percentage of stocks overfished is currently 20%.  The number of stocks with unknown status has decreased to 22 because of increased and improved scientific advice and research.  It is good to see stocks continue on an upwards trend for next year.  It must be remembered that there were only 20 stocks fished in a sustainable manner as recently as 2013 and we now have 38.<\/p><p>There are multiple reasons stocks have unknown status, including short-time series of biological data, conflicting data inputs, low catches or insufficient sampling data, or indeed missing catch information.  Over time, the percentage of stocks with unknown pressure and state indicators has declined.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the sustainability impact assessment, SIA, which will be laid before the D&aacute;il.  For further information, the fish stocks of interest to Ireland are available in the stock book which is prepared annually.  This is a large piece of work by the Marine Institute and is available on its website<\/p><p> Regarding the economic and social impact, BIM has based the socioeconomic assessment on the ICES advice, where available.  In cases where the ICES advice was not yet available or where ICES had provided zero-catch advice for stock, a rollover of last year's TACs was assumed so that the assessment of these stocks could be carried out by BIM.  ICES advice for nephrops, or prawns, as we know them commonly, is expected to be released on 28 October, so we do not have that yet.  In advance of the advice and to assist consideration of the stocks in the Celtic and Irish seas, different scenarios of a 10% reduction, a straightforward rollover, and a 10% increase were examined as this is an important stock for our fishing industry.  It is our second most valuable stock across the sector.  It is important to highlight that the estimates of BIM may change, depending on the final quotas and the total allowable catches agreed between the EU and the UK.  As this advice is for a single stock assessment, we can expect significant changes for stocks in mixed fisheries where a particular stock is depleted.  This is the case, for example, for cod stocks around the coast, and the total allowable catches for commercial stocks for cod as a by-catch will be set to support the protection and rebuilding of the depleted stocks.<\/p><p> If the TACs were to be agreed on the basis of the assumptions I have mentioned, we would see a net increase in fishing opportunity of 2% by volume in tonnes but a reduction of 6% in value.  This amounts to a direct income reduction of &euro;13 million.  For the demersal whitefish sector, this would mean a reduction of 12% in volume of fishing activity and a reduction of 6% by value, with a direct income loss of &euro;6.2 million.  For the pelagic sector, this would result in a reduction of 5% by volume and 7% by value, with a direct income reduction of &euro;6.9 million.  This is primarily due to the decrease in horse mackerel where ICES provided zero-catch advice for next year.  This would, however, be partially offset by following the significant increase in the advice for blue whiting, which has a recommended increase of 81%.<\/p><p> In addition to the direct losses to the fleet of quota reductions, income would also be lost from the processing sector as a result of reduced catches and in a number of ancillary industries such as net making, chandlery, engineering and refrigeration.  This would obviously have a knock-on effect for employment.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara further estimates, on the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, that if the TACs were set in accordance with the single stock advice, it could impact 400 full-time and part-time jobs.  This could occur either through reduced incomes or partial layoffs or redundancies in the seafood sector.<\/p><p> The Hague Preferences, which are the additional amounts of quota that Ireland can claim for important whitefish stocks when the TACs fall below set levels, are negotiated annually at the Fisheries Council in December.  They cannot be taken for granted.  Many member states often strenuously object to the application of the additional quota for Ireland.  Ensuring the preferences are applied will be a key political priority for my Department at the December meeting.<\/p><p> The sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment we are discussing here today provides a good picture of the state of stock and possible implications for 2023.  I thank and acknowledge those who contributed to the production of the impact assessment.  While the assessment is based on the ICES advice rather than TACs proposed by the European Commission, it does highlight the potential for significant impacts on the Irish fishing industry.  There are some stocks where ICES has issued-zero-catch advice.  However, with the implementation of the landing obligation and the requirement to land all catches, including by-catches from such stocks, this would lead to choke situations in mixed fisheries.  The EU and the UK previously established specific TACs for by-catches for these stocks to avoid fisheries being choked.  This highlights the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery and a maximum sustainable yield, MSY, fishery at the same time, so it is challenging.  We need to strike a balance between the potential for severe socioeconomic impacts and the need to achieve good environmental status for the stock.  I would be supportive of a similar approach as was taken in previous years for these depleted stocks.<\/p><p> I look forward to hearing and answering any questions members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#B00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>My questions are based on the Minister's opening statement.  He said these past few years have been particularly challenging for our fishing industry.  In addition to the continuing fuel crisis, the impacts of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and the quota transfers under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement are still having a very negative effect.  These are the Minister's words but what has the Government done to provide our fishermen with a fuel subsidy?  The French and the Spanish fishermen have received fuel subsidies from their governments.  Why has this Government stood back and not done the same for our fishermen?  This Government has given away to foreign fleets the rights of our fishermen to fish in Irish waters.  You would think the Minister and the extremist Green Party would at least have given a fuel subsidy to our fishermen.<\/p> <p>  I was at the recent Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation AGM.  It was good hear the head of the organisation, Pat Murphy, put his case.  The members are the people at sea.  They know exactly what is going on.  They ask about things like the recent announcement giving some people a bit of help with their energy bills, whether it is businesses or ordinary individuals.  Fishermen also have energy bills.  Was there anything in the budget for them?  Recently I was speaking on the Finance Bill and I asked the Minister the same question in relation to fishing.  What was the delivery for fishing in the budget?  I see zilch.  Fishermen have severe energy costs and they are asking me anything can be done about these costs.  The Spanish and the French are getting a subsidy so why are the Irish not getting it?  All we get is the decommissioning and the tie-up schemes.  I was totally opposed to them, as was the Irish south west organisation, but still, unfortunately, fishermen in south-west Cork and other areas are saying it is the only way out now of a sad situation.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said the waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU, that we have a duty of care and a national self-interest to protect their biological riches and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  That is great, but where in the world does it make sense to give away our fishing rights to foreign fleets?  The Minister may say it is so, that  we must be responsible etc., but where does it make any sense that a boat fishing out of Castletownbere or Union Hall or Killybegs should be tied up at the pier while foreign counterparts can fish away to their hearts' content in some of our waters?  It is no wonder fishermen are very frustrated.  I attended that AGM and there is a sense of massive frustration.  I was the only elected political figure who attended it but it would be educational for any politician to attend the AGM because each year they find the hill is getting harder to climb.  This is nothing personal, even if it always seems like it is, but the Minister got a poisoned chalice with this.  It is what it is, however, and we have been led down this road.  The fishermen are angry and the Minister and the Department need to stand up and fight for our fishermen.  This is why they were elected and we were elected: to get the fishermen a fuel subsidy and improved quotas.  It is an absolute disgrace what has happened to this industry.  It was one of the finest indigenous industries in this country and this Government and the Department officials have driven it to the shore with no prospects of a future for many.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister again try to get some of our quota back and provide a fuel subsidy to the industry?  We welcome the proposed 81% increase and I sincerely hope it will happen.  Decisions have to be made around that increase in blue whiting.  However, this will only benefit a club of 23 vessels in our fleet under the current application of the policy.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's opening statement also says that the waters around Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the E.U.  It also says that we have a duty of care and a national self-interest to protect their biological riches and as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  That is great but where in the world does it make sense to give away our fishing rights to foreign fleets?  One can say we must be responsible but where does it make any sense that a boat fishing out of Castletownbeare or Union Hall or Killybegs should be tied up at the pier while their foreign counterparts can fish away to their hearts' content in our waters?  It is not wonder that fishermen are very frustrated.  There was a sense of massive frustration at that AGM that I attended.  As the only elected political figure that attended it.  I think it would be educational for any politician to attend because each year they find that the hill is getting harder to climb.  It seems like it always is but this is nothing personal.  I think the Minister got a poisoned chalice with his appointment.  However, it is what it is and we have been led down this road.  Deputy McConalogue is the Minister and the fishermen are in agreement that the Department needs to stand up and fight for our fishermen.  This is why we were elected, to go out there and get them a fuel subsidy, try to improve our quotas.  It is an absolute disgrace what has happened to this industry.  One of the finest indigenous industries in this country and this Government and the Department officials have driven it to the shore with no prospects of a future for many.  My questions are my repeat statement over and over again.  Will you try and get some of our quota back and again, as per my question, will the Minister and the Government provide a fuel subsidy.<\/p><p>Will the Minister revise the policy so those other pelagic vessels that lose their scad mackerel fishery will get a fair share of this national fishery?  As I mentioned, the scad mackerel stock is estimated to have 805,000 tonnes of live fish.  Knowing this species lives to a good age and there are good results from the egg survey two years ago, surely we can agree to adopt the rebuilding plan accepted by ICES to be precautionary.  I am sure the Minister knows I am not going to end my contribution without once again asking why are we not approaching the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, ICCAT, for a small bluefin tuna quota?  If you want to know why cod and herring stocks are so low I think the sea is full of these fish.  It could be a significant contribution in their eating of this fish, flattening here to be caught by everyone but us.  Even the Japanese fleet lands in to Killybegs when coming to catch them.  I know they also do it in international waters but the bluefin tuna are only a mile from our shore and we cannot catch them.  I would appreciate if the Minister might answer some of those questions. Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#D00200","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael Collins.  First, on the fuel subsidy, the Deputy pointed out that in my opening statement, I outlined the real challenges we have had over the past couple of years.  Biggest of all has been the Brexit challenge and the impact that has had on quota.  Of course, we fought in every way we could to try to protect the sector from any impact.  Unfortunately it was not possible to protect it fully, given that in terms of full outcome of the trade and co-operation agreement, a no-deal scenario would have been really damaging for the fishing sector.  We know that because we discussed it here on many occasions.  One third of the fish we catch is caught in British waters and access to those waters was really important, so it was really difficult.  That has been a challenge and one we have worked hard with our fishers to deal with.  Since the start of the year, as with many other sectors of society, we have had the fuel challenge emerging from the illegal invasion of Ukraine.  That led to an immediate spike in fuel for fishing vessels.  Marine gas oil is different from a lot of other fuel, in that there is no Revenue tax applied to it and the VAT is reclaimable.  There is no capacity to reduce the Revenue tax because it is not there.  It spiked from around 60 cent per litre before the invasion to more than &euro;1 per litre very quickly afterwards.  It has gone up and down since then.  Shortly after the illegal invasion, I met the fishers at their request to discuss that challenge.  All of the fisher representatives coming together made the request to me for a second-month tie-up scheme to try to address and help with the impact on fuel.  The sea-fisheries task force, which I set up last year, had recommended that this year, there would be a one-month tie-up available to every boat and that was in play.  I had that progressing but they asked for a second month, specifically because of the real challenges the fleet was experiencing from fuel.  I moved and delivered that, and implemented it.  That meant an extra &euro;12 million to the whitefish sector.  When you look at that in terms of the financial allocation to our fleet, it is similar to the financial allocation France and Spain have applied to their fleets.  That has been in place since June and is running until the end of November.  I stepped in and delivered that much-needed &euro;12 million to support the sector.  The sector has been requesting that I do something on top of that measure, similar to what France and Spain have done.  However, I have been assessing how the measure put in place has been working.  Other member states did not do that.  They took a different approach but with a similar level of investment relative to the size of their fleets.  That runs until the end of November.  We have seen a spike in the past couple of weeks.  It has gone down again in the last week but it spiked to over &euro;1 in terms of the international benchmark between a week and two weeks ago.  It has come back down to the mid to high 80s in the last few days.  That is the international benchmark price.  It would be higher than that in terms of the actual pump price for vessels because of transport etc.  I am assessing the situation again in light of that and looking at the challenges because I am keen on ensuring that we have appropriate supports in place for our fishing sector.<\/p> <p>  Some have indicated there is a fund available at European level that I am simply leaving behind by not applying such an additional support scheme.  However, what the European Commission has done is provide flexibility for member states to use some of their unspent or future European Maritime and Fisheries Fund money to pay out in terms of reduced fuel costs.  It is not that there is a separate fund.  It would mean using funding that is allocated and earmarked for the industry and investment in the industry.  It would mean using that instead as a direct upfront payment to deal with the pressures at the moment.  I have never ruled that out.  I have said that I have been continuing to monitor the situation and continuing to monitor the impact of the &euro;12 million that I have already put in place.  I am looking at that afresh because none of us know where we are going with fuel.  We had all hoped it would taper off and reduce but that has not been the case and prices have spiked again.  I am looking at and assessing that afresh again.<\/p> <p>   The Deputy also indicated there that this Government has given away the right to fish, to foreign governments.  That is not something this Government has done.  As he is aware, there has been a Common Fisheries Policy established since the early 1980s, whereby the percentage share each country has of various fish stocks was set and allocated.  The percentages were based on the amount of catching different countries were doing at that time.  Some countries got higher percentages of stocks, some countries got lower percentages, based on how much they were fishing at that time.  That was in the early 1980s.  That was done as a management tool to manage the waters generally, because as we know whenever you do not manage waters or manage stocks, they get depleted and they get fished out.  It was set in the early 1980s and despite many reviews and many tugs of war at European level since, that overall allocation key for various stocks between countries has stayed the same.  In order to change it at European level you have to get a qualified majority vote at a European Council meeting.  The one big impact to that allocation key has been Brexit, because the UK has left.  That has disrupted the allocation key in a way that has been unfair to us.  That is something I am looking to get addressed and I am raising it at each and every Council meeting and every engagement I have with my colleagues.  The point I am making is that it should be addressed in terms of the Common Fisheries Policy review that is to conclude over the next number of months.  The unfair burden we have should be addressed as part of that.  It is a system that has been in place since the early 1980s so it is not something this Government has done.  In fact everything I have done as Minister has been to try to improve our fisheries situation and to try and get more quota for our fleet.  I have been battling for that and have voted against many things at European level in order to assert and follow that objective.<\/p> <p>   The Deputy has also mentioned the decommissioning scheme, which he says he and the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation oppose.  The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, along with every other fishing representative organisation, would have been part of the sea-fisheries task force group, which I set up.  Post Brexit and its massive impact on our fisheries, I brought all of the fishing voices to advise me on how I could best support the sector and how we could respond to that challenge.  They unanimously put forward their task force report to me.<\/p><p>One of their asks was a decommissioning scheme to address the size of the fleet to make sure their boats were economic and viable.  That was their request and all the fisheries organisations unanimously signed up to that.  It is not a situation that any of us want to be in.  I wish I could bring about a situation where we gather more quota and, as I said, I am trying to do that all of the time.  All of us, both politically and the fishery representatives, know we have to deal with the situation as it currently stands and as we try to change it.  As I have said, one of their recommendations was a decommissioning scheme.  That is why I have come forward and followed through in relation to their request to me.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Collins mentioned boats being tied up while foreign boats fish.  The request was that I do a tie-up scheme.  The task force asked me for that, that is, all of the fishing representatives I brought together.  They asked for a one month tie-up scheme for 2022.  They subsequently asked for a second month tie-up scheme to respond to the fuel challenge, which I addressed earlier on.  The way a tie-up scheme works is that one out of every three boats ties up in any given month.  It does not change the level of quota we have.  We still fish our full quota.  It is not that other countries are in fishing our national quota.  Our national quota still gets fully fished but it means that instead of there being three boats out fishing the quota, there are two boats out fishing the same quota.  One boat ties up at the pier side and that boat gets paid to tie-up at the pier side.  It gets paid the equivalent of what it would have made if it had been out fishing.  That means that the two boats that are still out fishing have in theory an extra 50% fish to catch to make their trips to sea more viable.  That is how the tie-up works.  One boat ties up and instead of three boats going to sea, two go to sea.  They catch the same quota the three would have caught and, therefore, they are catching extra fish.  It is about making them more economically viable.  I was asked to do that.  It is not that others are fishing our fish because the boats out fishing, which are not tied up, are catching the full quota.  It is not that others are catching the fish and we are leaving the fish behind.<\/p><p> On the issue of the scad mackerel, Deputy Michael Collins asked for a reallocation between boats.  That is always challenging and contested between various sectors of the fleet.  Within the fleet everyone wants more quota.  They want a reallocation of it that leaves individual boats with more quota so while they will always those be in favour of that, there will be as many against it.  <\/p><p> As regards the EU negotiations for bluefin tuna, they are conducted by the European Commission with International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, ICAT.   I do not negotiate directly with ICAT as that is something the European Commission does on behalf of all member states.  It is something I have raised at Council meetings but because it is a fish we did not traditionally have, achieving a quota is very difficult.  However, it is something that I continuously try to make progress on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#E00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Okay.

For example, mackerel spawns off the south-west coast of Ireland, travels all the way north to Norway and then travels back.  Therefore, it goes through lots of different member states' waters so they all have to come together to agree how it is fished, if it is to be fished sustainably.  They all have to agree but they have not been agreeing.  Some have been basically putting their arm in and trying to set their own total allowable catch, TAC.

It comes from the north coast of Spain, up to Norway, then to UK, Faroese, Icelandic and international waters and a little bit over to Greenland.  A huge area is covered.  We catch 24% of our mackerel in our own 200 mile zone and we catch the rest of it in UK waters, so we fish internationally.  As the Minister said, it does a big migration from spawning in the south-west of Ireland up over all of those areas in a feeding migration.  It hibernates in Norway at the bottom of the fjords in the middle of winter and then migrates back down again.  It is fished all along the migration route.<\/p> <p>  To manage this, countries in whose waters this happens have a duty to co-operate under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  However, it is only a duty to seek to co-operate.  We had an agreement governing mackerel between most of the parties from 2014 to 2020.  Iceland was not a party to that but there was an amount set aside for Iceland, Greenland and Russia.  That agreement came to an end in 2020 and coincided with the UK leaving the EU and no agreement has been capable of being put in place for the last couple of years.  Norway then set a unilateral total allowable catch, TAC, increasing it by 55%.  The Faroe Islands followed suit.  The EU and UK stayed with their share of the advised global TAC.  The result of all that is that the amount of fishing has substantially exceeded what is the scientifically advised amount of catch each year.  The concern is that the stock will react to that and we will see a downturn in the stock this year.  Our TAC is advised at minus 2% and if fishing remains at its current high levels, we are going to see much more significant reductions.<\/p> <p>  These are all sovereign countries, so they have to agree to a deal as sovereign parties.  There is no mechanism to force a deal.  The negotiations have started to try to get a new sharing arrangement in place.

The information that leads into the assessment of a stock contains not only the Irish data from the Irish catches but also that from the French and Spanish and the UK, for that matter.  In the case of the international stocks, it also contains the catch and survey data from other international parties such as Russia, Norway and Iceland.  It is a large international collaborative effort that is used to do that assessment.  One of the things that has impacted some, although not all, of the assessments in the past two years is Covid and the ability to be able to get sampling data from vessels.  One of the factors was that we put in a mechanism to get the fishing industry to collaborate with us to do self sampling, and Ireland coped very well in this regard.  They were bringing samples of the catches ashore so that we could biologically assess them but some other countries did not have that scheme in place and, therefore, the data became poorer during Covid.  It was during the Covid period, when the data got poorer, that impacted the assessments that are now coming through.  That is one reason some of the assessments have got poorer recently.  That should be rectified in time.  An international sampling agreement is in place in the EU called the data collection framework.  All European countries participate in that.  Everyone puts their shoulder to the wheel to collect the data and put it through into the assessment.  That short-term situation around Covid should be ameliorated.  In the longer term, there are always stocks for which there is simply insufficient information.  These are stocks that are caught as a by-catch.  The information on those is not good enough to do the assessments from which we give figures for maximum sustainable yield, MSY, for example.  Those stocks are assessed and advice is given on the precautionary approach.  Sometimes the MSY stocks status would be unknown but in relation to the precautionary approach, a precautionary advice would be given to manage those stocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Last year, the Minister said that if tax was set in accordance with the single stock advice it would impact on 248 jobs, full time and part time.

Yet Belgium&rsquo;s fish processing sector had a turnover of &euro;961m in 2019 compared to just &euro;622m for Ireland,&rdquo;he says, drawing figures from Eurostat.  Germany has a coastline of 2389km, [that is substantially less than Ireland] yet in 2019 their fish processing sector turnover was &euro;2,196m.  [That is multiples of Ireland]  Furthermore, over the last eight years, the Irish industry has fallen from 3rd highest in Europe to 10th place.  The decommissioning scheme will reduce the whitefish fleet to a third of its 2006 size. <\/blockquote><p>That is the scale of the scandal of allocation of resources to our own fleet in some of the richest fishing grounds in Europe.  When one looks at the comparison in respect of coastline and the scale of the resources versus the return, and the devastating impact it is having, can you imagine the number of jobs that have been lost to coastal communities because of this repeated failure to get justice?  <br\/><br\/>In the Minister&rsquo;s presentation today, even the Hague preferences are not certain.  I will proceed now with my questions.<br\/><br\/>In the second paragraph of his opening statement, the Minister stated, &ldquo;In addition to the continuing fuel crisis&rdquo;.  At the outset, the Minister acknowledged the impact of the fuel crisis on our fleet, yet we are an outlier in Europe in respect of introducing an emergency fuel subsidy.  Obviously, I will question the Minister in the D&aacute;il Chamber on this point and we will have a more substantial interaction in a little while there, but I am completely shocked.  I understood a number of days ago that there was an expectation in the industry that something would be announced given the scale of this.  I was speaking to inshore fishermen from different parts around the coast again in recent days and this is a real crisis.  The tie-up scheme is entirely separate.  That is a Brexit adjustment reserve fund matter to compensate for the loss of quota and is an unrelated matter.  We are talking here about the impact of the fuel crisis and the failure of our Government, an outlier in Europe, where resources are available and states are being actively encouraged by the European Commission to do something, and nothing is being done.  I trust, now that the Minister has highlighted this issue in the second paragraph of his opening statement, that there will be action on that and perhaps we will receive a response to that in a moment.  I have three questions and then afterwards I will have a final three questions to ask, with the leave of the Chairperson.<br\/><br\/>My second question is on the Common Fisheries Policy.  The Minister proposed to extend our exclusive zone to 20 miles.  Can the Minister give the committee an update as to why that has not been accepted and where it all stands at the moment?  This is of particular importance to a number of sectors.<br\/><br\/>As I have said, I have a number of other questions to wrap up when I hear the Minister&rsquo;s response, but my third question relates to the EU-UK consultations.  On these, the Minister talks about the sequencing and the involvement of the industry, which I welcome.  The Minister wants to get to the point where by the time there is a EU-UK approach to that, the input of the industry can be maximised into that, and getting the feedback based upon the scientific data.  The one thing that is missing and that stand out like a sore thumb is Rockall.  What has happened here is completely outrageous.  As the Irish Government has stated, this is an uninhabited rock.  You cannot put an exclusive limit around an uninhabited rock.  I want to receive some assurance from the Minister today that in those negotiations, he will assert the traditional fishing rights of our industry.  As the Minister knows, from Greencastle, Killybegs and down to Castletownbere, this has cost over &euro;7 million per year.  This is completely outrageous.<br\/><br\/>My criticism is that in the middle of this process of negotiations with the British Government, the Irish Government made something that had been unconstitutional constitutional by ratifying the 2013 agreement by way of incorporating it in the Maritime Jurisdiction Act  That was a significant mistake because, as the Minister is aware from the Barlow Supreme Court judgment in regard to the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement, while an agreement may have been made at government-to-government level, unless such an agreement is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, it does not have a constitutional footing.  We allowed a situation where we confirmed in our law, in line with our Constitution, that by passing that Bill in the Oireachtas, we conceded that territory.  Even though we did that, which was a huge mistake, we should still have access into those grounds under the justice of reciprocity.  There can be no justification for Britain putting an exclusive zone around an uninhabited island.  It has no basis for that under international law.  It would be repudiated by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, for example.  <br\/><br\/>I want to know, therefore, what is happening in respect of Rockall and will it form a robust part of these negotiations when our Government engages with the British Government?  I know that this is EU to British Government level, but will our Government insist that the EU asserts the right of our fishermen in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#G01000","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for his questions.

That position had remained constant since then until the impact of Brexit.  If one looks at what we catch in our waters, in value terms, we catch &euro;128 million of the fish caught in our waters.  Non-Irish boats catch &euro;254 million value of fish in our waters.  We then catch &euro;122 million worth of fish in non-Irish waters, that is, outside of Irish waters altogether.

If one then looks at it in respect of the volume of tonnage, it is much more disjointed and imbalanced, primarily because of the impact of blue whiting, because 70% of the total volume of fish caught in our waters is blue whiting, that is, not looking at it from a value point of view.<\/p> <p>  Again, the challenge here goes back to the early 1980s and to what various countries were catching at that time.  That percentage of the pie was set then.  If one then looks at how that has evolved and if one takes Greencastle, for example, my own and the Deputy&rsquo;s own port, this port will still catch as much fish now as it would have 20 or 30 plus years ago but there is a much smaller number of boats catching this fish.  If one had walked the pier in Greencastle 20 to 30 years ago it would have been very busy with a great many smaller boats with many more people fishing from it, whereas now it is a smaller number of larger boats that are making the catch but a similar level of fish to what was being caught, compared to whenever the pier seemed a great deal busier because of the number of people who had been employed then and the size of the boats.  The overall catch allocation and value has remained consistent, Brexit aside, and we in government and I have been consistently trying to ensure that the impact of Brexit, and in particular the fact that we are the country that is most impacted by that event, should be addressed at European level.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the Hague preferences not being certain, that has been the case ever since the Hague preferences were put in place.  These have to be agreed at each EU December meeting of the Council.  This is often resisted but has always been applied and, likewise, it is something that I will seek to ensure happens again.<\/p> <p>  On the question of Ireland being an outlier in respect of an emergency fuel subsidy, as I explained in detail earlier on, the sea-fisheries task force report recommended a one-month tie-up for every boat for this year.  As the Deputy knows, the seafood task force I put together had all of the fishing representatives involved.  That is what their report asked for, that is, one month for 2022.<\/p> <p>  After the invasion of Ukraine and the impact on fuel, the fishing representatives sought to meet with me again and asked for a second month&rsquo;s tie-up scheme specifically to address the fuel challenges there because of that new impact.  That second month has delivered &euro;12 million into the sector and is similar to the investment that would have been made by France or Spain into its fuel subsidies.  I have never ruled out the fact that I would step in to take further action and I have been monitoring the situation very closely.<\/p><p>The funding in the EMFF is still there.  It is earmarked for other purposes but I can still step in and spend that now.  It is an investment into the sector and will be for other things within the sector.  However, Europe has allowed for the facility to spend that now as a cash payment to support the fleet.<\/p><p> We had hoped that the fuel situation would be more short lived and that it would dissipate.  Over the last few weeks, it had come down somewhat, but it has spiked again.  We have seen that.  I am reassessing the situation and I am also very much bearing in mind that the tie-up scheme, which has been in place since June, is due to run out at the end of November.  I am considering that and I am looking at it afresh.  <\/p><p> We have responded to it, to be fair.  That has been clear.  It was a response that was sought from me by the fishing representatives, and I responded to that promptly.  That often does not get mentioned in the discussion.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn never mentions it and he disputes it as well, but that is the position.  The funding that was invested through that has been similar to what France and Spain have done, for example.  <\/p><p> In terms of the 20 mile review, at the moment, under the Common Fisheries Policy, which was established in the early 1980s, we have exclusive access to our 10 mile zone.  Other countries, depending on historical fishing activity, have had some access in some parts to our 10 mile to 20 mile zone.  I saw it as part of the Common Fisheries Policy review access arrangements to gain complete access and control of our 20 mile zone.  That is something that I pushed hard for at European level.  I travelled specifically to Paris to meet with the French Minister for the marine, Annick Girardin, to press this.  I met with many other member states at EU level as well.  However, I was the only fishing Minister in Europe who was seeking to change that.  There was not support from any other Minister who was seeking to access arrangements anywhere.  I was seeking to change that.  As with most things at European Council level, it requires a qualified majority vote to bring about change.  That was not achieved, and I voted against the proposal to move on without delivering that.  That then went to the EU Parliament, where it was discussed because all three of the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament have to agree on the approach.  The renewal of the access arrangements under the Common Fisheries Policy has to be completed by the end of this year because if it is not agreed by the end of this year, the default position would be that every member state would have access to the shoreline of every other member state.  Therefore, it had to be dealt with by the end of the year.  I sought as part of that to try to push ours out a bit further, but that was not successful.  At a European Parliament level, there was not the support to qualify for majority support there for it, either.  The outcome of that is that it will be reviewed in three or four years&rsquo; time, but it is to be renewed now before the end of this year.  <\/p><p> In relation to Rockall, as the Deputy knows, Rockall has always been in British waters, but we dispute the right of Britain to an exclusive 10 mile zone around Rockall.  The right to a zone is defined under international law, but we have recognised their right to any 10 mile zone around it or their right to any sovereignty of the rock of Rockall.  However, it has always been in British waters.  That agreement to which the Deputy referred in 2013 did not change that.  Rockall was always in British waters even prior to that.  The dispute that we have with them, and what we have totally dispute, is that they have any right to that exclusive, 10 mile access zone around Rockall.  We have never agreed to that, and we still hold that position strongly.<\/p><p> What happened when Britain left the European Union is that Rockall is now part of British waters and not part of European waters, while it was all part of European waters previously.  British waters, our waters and all other waters were European waters.  Now there are European waters and British waters.  Because Rockall is and always was located in British waters, it is now within its water.  There is now a licencing arrangement under the Brexit agreement for European boats, including Irish boats, to be able to access British waters.  That has made the situation more challenging, but we continue to hold a position that there should not be any 10 mile zone.  We are continuing to engage to try to achieve diplomatic progress in relation to that and to assert our historical fishing rights in that area, which is an important fishing ground for boats from Greencastle and from Donegal in particular.  Boats from the south-west coast go to fish there too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#H00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will not speak further about Rockall.  It has been two and a half years and almost three years.  It is an outrageous position that the British Government is taking, and I would ask that it would be dealt with.  It has to be on the agenda as part of these negotiations.  It is extreme bad faith.<\/p> <p>  The next number of questions will address the part of the Minister&rsquo;s presentation that dealt with the coastal states, as well as the difficulty with the non-coastal states.  I particularly refer to this issue around Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland.  The approach that they have taken unilaterally in defiance of the science that we all have to operate within is outrageous.  The concerns are in terms of this 2% reduction in macro.  There are the law abiders who are saying that there would need to be a 2% reduction based on the science.  This is happening in the context of the behaviour by the Norwegians, the Faroese and the Icelandic.  Iceland has built up a huge fishing industry that was not there before.  I want to get a sense of how this has been allowed to continue.  There is a fear that some of the corporations that have invested in these fishing opportunities and companies have too much of an influence at European Commission level.  Some of them are based in the European member states.  How can the Minister stand over asking Irish fisherman to play by the rules as they are based in science - which is fair enough and as he says in his presentation that is what they want to do - while on the other hand tolerating the situation with the Norwegians, Faroese and Icelandic?  This is backed by huge investment from corporations, some of which are based in the European member states and some of which are availing of quota under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Can the Minister make more comments on that?  <\/p> <p>  My final couple of questions relate to the issue of the Hague references.  We asked for what was called burden sharing, and some of the fishing organisations have recently spoken about levelling up, rather than burden sharing.  The Minister might have heard that terminology in his engagement.  This is about a fair share of the impact that comes from Brexit.  That just cannot go away.  The Minister has provided information on landings.  Whatever way he presents the issue of what percentage of the fish we get from our own EEZ, whether this is value versus tonnage and that debate will go on, the fact is that if one looks at the wealth of our seafood sector, which is indisputable, we have gone down the league table.  We have less of a value of a country like Belgium, which has a fraction of our coastline.  We have a fraction of the wealth of the German seafood sector, even though we have a much bigger coastline.  That cannot be stood over.  We can debate back and forth on this.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Chair for his forbearance, my point is that this is a profound injustice.  We are seeing our seafood sector decline.  We are seeing the loss of thousands of potential jobs in coastal community.  I just do not get a sense of anger towards this injustice at an Irish Government level.  That is just the sense that is there.<\/p><p>The Minister has said he pushed for extending the 12 miles to 20 miles and that he was the only voice in there.  At some point there has to be some challenge to the injustice of this.  How is this based on environmental best standards when we have huge corporations investing in member states' quota and being rewarded while our own fleet is decommissioned to one third of what it was in 2006?  I want to get a sense of the outrage of what is happening here and how it could be in line with the more admirable principles of the European Union.  The stated principles are certainly admirable but the actions do not follow.  I see corporations being rewarded that are investing in multiple member states.  Anti-environmental practices are being rewarded.  It is very hard to ask Irish fishing communities to step up when they do not see the same rules being applied either within the European member states or outside.  We are partners with Norway, Faroe Islands and Iceland.  These are strategic partners and we are tolerating this type of behaviour and abuse.  I just do not feel the outrage about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#J00200","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>It is not tolerable and it is not being tolerated.

If people do not come together and agree on managing fisheries sustainably there is only one inevitable result, which is the fishery disappearing over time.

Almost all of them have availed of it in the whitefish sector.  As the Senator says, they have found it to have made a positive contribution.  It has made fishing and going to sea more economically viable because it has made more quota available to those who are at sea while those who are tied up for one month are able to avail of an income from the tie-up funding.  The sector's representatives are asking for a further tie-up scheme for the start of next year.<\/p><p>That request has come forward in recent times and it is something I will consider.<\/p><p> The rationale and logic behind the tie-up scheme has been as an interim measure pending the decommissioning scheme.  The objective behind the proposal for the decommissioning scheme is to ensure the boats that fish are viable and make a good income.  The way the decommissioning scheme works is such that if boats decide not to continue, the quota they would have fished is redistributed among the remaining boats.  The quota is still fished, therefore, but fewer boats fish it.  I raised the example earlier of Greencastle, near my home village, where the number of fish being caught is similar to what it would have been 20 or 30 years ago, but the number of boats catching it is a lot lower and the number of fishers who work on catching it is lower because the capacity catch is much higher.  It is no different from my experience growing up on a farm, or from that of the Senator, I am sure, where the machinery was much smaller, and the man hours much longer, to do the same work.<\/p><p> What I and the industry want is a greater quota to make our ports even more viable.  That is a fight and a battle with which we will continue but, as I said, that has not changed since the early 1980s, when the percentage carve-up was decided based on the fishing activity of member states at the time.  While we will continue to fight that battle at European level, the proposal is in place in regard to the decommissioning scheme to ensure that the boats that fish will have a quota that makes it economically viable to do so.  Once the decommissioning scheme comes into place, the idea is that the need for the tie-up scheme will be removed because the boats that fish will have a greater quota to fish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#K01200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I might just follow through on the Minister's logic for a moment.

Indeed, I took a very hard line in relation to the access arrangements as well, which were discussed over the last number of months, as I outlined earlier.  Brexit has had the single biggest sideways impact on the relative stability since it was put in place in the early 1980s.  We sought to avoid any impact in the first place, but throughout the Brexit negotiations and afterwards our position was that if there was to be any impact as a result of it, there should be fair burden sharing.  That is something that member states were generally agreed on in principle.  It is something that was agreed by industry representatives as well, including fishing industry representatives here in Ireland, who worked with their counterparts.  Of course, everyone worked closely together.  I worked closely with our fishing industry representatives and other member states in determining how to tackle the Brexit challenge.

In the early 1970s, a fisherman with an average size fishing boat was deemed to be as well off as a person who owned a farm and it is ironic to think that we have lost most of that.  We all can picture in our minds the fishing fleet that came up the River Liffey and the display they gave across the way from the convention centre, and the organised way they made their request clear to us and to the Minister who was present on that day.  It is sad to think that nothing has improved except decommissioning.  The Government has failed the Irish fishing industry.  In fact, previous Governments have completely and utterly failed the fishing communities in coastal communities.<\/p><p> Behind every boat and vessel was a shop, butcher shop, local restaurant or whatever which all depended on those vessels and their catches.  The spin-off is so important and vital as well as the income for fishermen.  The current situation adversely affects coastal communities on the periphery of the Atlantic Ocean.  We have so many miles and grand places but I will only talk about places in County Kerry.  There are places such as Dingle, Portmagee, Sneem, the Oysterbed Pier, Blackwater, Kilmackillogue, Glounaguillagh, Tuosist and all the way back to Castletownbere.  A lot of fishermen in Kerry use the facilities at Castletownbere.<\/p><p> I liken decomissioning to the eco schemes being offered to farmers to get them out of farming.  I hate the word \"decommissioning\" because I know that once someone decommissions and gets out of an industry then that livelihood is lost and many more livelihoods are lost within the community.<\/p><p> I have listened to what the Minister said about the tie-up policy.  He repeatedly said in his presentation that there is a fund in Europe that has not been touched yet.  I ask the Minister and the Government to go after that fund.  I do not know what they are waiting for because there is a risk that boats and fishing fleets will go out of business with the cost of fuel and everything and, therefore, we need to use that fund now.<\/p><p> I welcome the 81% increase in the TAC for blue whiting but it will only benefit 23 vessels out of the total fleet around the country.  I ask the Minister to revise the policy so others may benefit from this allowance and mackerel fishery as well in order to get a fair share of this national fishery.<\/p><p> I have heard complaints that mackerel is very scarce from Kenmare, out the Kenmare river and out to the mouth of Kenmare Bay.  Who knows anything about that and why is that the case?  I have also got complaints of massive trawlers coming in at different times and sweeping up everything.  No-one knows who they are but they have cleaned out every type of fish.  I have heard that complaint on the side of the county which I represent.  Who knows about that and is the Minister aware of the situation?  I ask because the issue is very serious.  In the past there were people who fished along the bay but caught so much mackerel, even though they caught them a good few miles away, they gave them to the people inside in the bar or on the street.  Those fishermen are not be to found at all this year whatever has happened.  I have been asked several times to find out what is the reason for the changed situation.<\/p><p> It is late at night but I am very interested in discussing Brexit.  I do know that we did not do well out of the Brexit talks and it seems that the French gained.  I do not know whether we had adequate personnel at negotiations to fight the case for us.  I have been told by fishermen that in their hearts they believe that we lost the battle because we did not put up a reasonable and fair fight which is a shame.  These fishermen and our fishing industry have always been an integral part of coastal communities.  The farmer or the farmer's son or family went fishing in order to keep food on the table and we will lose many of these people with the way the thing is going.  Can the Minister do anything more than what has been done?<\/p><p> Long ago my father had a Ferguson tractor that he used to bring a load of rushes of all things into the village of Kilgarvan.  On one occasion a farmer wanted him to drive in between two houses but a load of rushes fell against the gable of the house and the man who had ordered him to come with the load of stuff asked him could he do any better.  To which my father replied, \"Sure I am doing my best\" and the farmer said that his best was not good enough.  I say to the Minister that his best so far has not been good enough.  Therefore, I ask him to do better and not allow the entire fishing fleet to disintegrate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#M03800","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Anything and everything that can be done to support the sector is being done.

A great scientist, Mr. John Molloy, was one of the people who looked back into the historical period, for example, the 1800s, when we saw see the exact same patterns of mackerel appearing and subsequently disappearing, particularly in the coastal area, which was a mystery at that point.  Those are what we call juvenile mackerel, which are small and immature.  Their distribution varies.  They do not just live in a place like we do on a farm or in a house; they follow food.  If there is little enough food available for them, depending on what they are hunting, they move into a different area.  The distribution of mackerel the Deputy sees around the coast is just based on the distribution of food the mackerel are hunting.  That is why they are there sometimes and not there other times.  That can happen from one year to the next.  Just because juvenile mackerel are not present in a bay in one particular year does not mean they are gone from the stock or gone from the bay.  They are just gone from that bay for that year because they are in another bay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The Minister might comment briefly on the big trawlers that are cleaning out everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#O00500","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>A decision was taken and a process put in place approximately three or four years ago by my predecessor, Deputy Creed, with regard to preventing large trawlers from operating inside the six-mile zone.

At its annual congress in 2022 a comprehensive motion was passed on the mental health of primary school children.  Our education consultative conference in 2021 had a focus on well-being and mental health.  Mental health was included as a topic at our equality conference in 2013.<\/p><p> We want the committee to note that the culture in which Irish primary schools operate is one that strives to be safe, healthy and inclusive for all pupils regardless of social background, race, self-identity and learning needs.  Primary teachers are profoundly aware of the importance of the well-being of their pupils.  The challenge of protecting the mental health and well-being of primary school children must not be underestimated.<\/p><p> National research carried out with children and young people by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 2013 suggests that approximately one in three young people will have experienced some type of mental disorder by the age of 13.  This rate rises to more than one in two by the age of 24 years when intervention does not take place.  This is more than 50%.  Research conducted by Dublin City University in 2017 found that the psychological well-being needs of children in primary school are complex.  This research identified a range and severity of difficulties that children present with in primary schools.  It also focused on the varied family and cultural contexts that are a feature of their daily lives.  Critical incidents of a serious nature that schools deal with include separation, divorce, marital breakdown, anxiety, bullying, cyberbullying, self-harm, suicidal ideation, eating disorders and sexual identity issues.  All of these impact on the mental health of children.<\/p><p> Ireland's child and adolescent mental health services are experiencing significant difficulties.  These have been well publicised and include a lack of services at community and school level, difficulties in recruiting qualified staff and excessive waiting lists for specialist mental health treatment services.  School principals have reported wait times of up to four years in some cases.  This is unacceptable and cannot continue. <\/p><p> The service that engages with children on an almost daily basis is the school.  Schools and school personnel must be supported by all other services when nurturing the positive mental health of pupils.  It is acknowledged that our mental health is influenced by our daily lives and that the foundation of good mental health starts in our youth.  In other jurisdictions, schools are recognised as the optimal venue for youth mental health promotion and prevention programmes as they are the only venue where all children and adolescents in society can be reached.  In those jurisdictions mental health professionals work in schools, alongside teachers, to support the mental health of pupils.<\/p><p> The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated stress and anxiety among children.  During school closures some pupils regressed not only in their learning but also in their social and emotional well-being.  Guidance published by the Department of Education in September 2020 advised that well-being be prioritised in our schools.  Teachers recognise the impact the trauma of the pandemic has had and seek increased resources for primary school teachers to adequately support children's mental health in the months and years ahead.<\/p><p> At its congress in April 2022 the INTO noted the dearth of mental health support services for primary school children.  During the debate on children&rsquo;s mental health delegates reported that more and more children present in primary school classrooms experiencing anxiety, poor mental health and poor emotional well-being.  The congress called for increased National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, provision for schools and clarity regarding the level of provision that schools can expect, a national framework to inform the development of counselling services for primary school children and resources to introduce on-site school counselling in primary schools in line with international best practice.  We are delighted to welcome the Minister's recent announcement of &euro;5 million to fund a pilot programme of counselling supports in primary schools.  We look forward to her engagement with stakeholders on the matter.<\/p><p> We note that Government policy dictates that all mental health and other professional services are provided in the community.  There is extensive international research to indicate that services co-located in schools experience a higher level of engagement and success.  We would argue that schools are an integral part of the community of children and families and ask the Government to re-examine and redefine \"community\" in this context.<\/p><p> The INTO recommends that schools are provided with adequate, age-appropriate supports for children presenting with mental health difficulties, increased NEPS provision for schools, the development of a national framework to inform the development of counselling services for primary school children and funding and resources for this.  It also recommends increased funding for child and adolescent mental health services and sufficient up-to-date professional development supports for teachers.  The INTO recognises the urgency in providing mental health supports for primary school pupils, especially at school level.<\/p><p>They must be properly resourced and meet the needs of the school community.  We remain committed to the support of the pupils in our care.<\/p><p> Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gcomhchoiste as ucht &eacute;isteacht liom inni&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>To clarify, Ms Sarah Behan is unwell today.  I am Sarah Hughes, the mental health programme manager.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairperson and members of the Oireachtas committee for the opportunity to speak to the committee today.  I am the mental health programme manager for the Union of Students in Ireland, which is the national student representative body for students in third level education.<\/p> <p>  I want to draw the committee's attention to the current issues we are facing with regard to mental health funding in higher education institutions, HEIs.<\/p> <p>  The current funding allocated to mental heath support in HEIs is not core or multi-annual.  While the extra funding provided for mental health during Covid is greatly welcomed, it only brought the student-to-counsellor ratio to 1:2,500, rather than the best standard practice of 1:1,000.  This funding also only refers to core counselling clinics and does not take other staff, such as GPs, health nurses, disability support staff or administrative staff, into account, although they may be needed to fully support student mental health.  A whole-of-campus approach is recommended by the national framework, and this cannot be achieved without core multi-annual funding.<\/p> <p>  While international researchers are loath to speak to an increase in mental health problems and suicide levels post-Covid-19, data from within Ireland, such as from the My World Survey 2 study, indicate that within this cohort mental distress was increasing prior to the pandemic, and appears to have continued to increase throughout.<\/p> <p>  Without core multi-annual funding, additional staff can only be hired on short-term contracts.  This not only makes it difficult to hire appropriately-skilled staff, but also makes any kind of planning beyond the short term almost impossible.  In addition, there is currently no information on how the mental health funding from the recent budget will be allocated.  This is resulting in campuses not knowing whether they can keep staff on, or if they need to cut services.  Ring-fenced multi-annual funding is needed to ensure that the mental health of students is seen as an integral aspect of college life.<\/p> <p>  Mental health staff are struggling to deal with the current demand of students presenting themselves in distress.  Recently, on a campus visit, I saw the strain that is being put on services, as there was only standing room left in the waiting room for an emergency counselling drop-in clinic.  It is important to note the fact that counsellors are expected to take on additional work related to the roll-out of various welfare-related policies.  We have recently seen funding being allocated to allow for appointed roles to help with the roll-out of frameworks relating to ending sexual violence and harassment.  We need to see similar funding being allocated to help with the roll-out of welfare-related frameworks.  Without it, it may come down to a counsellor having to choose between rolling out a framework or dealing with students in counselling sessions.<\/p> <p>  Increased multi-annual targeted funding for student counselling services and other student support services must be put in place to allow for the continued roll-out of services to meet demand on an ongoing basis, and in line with recent publications such as the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, Healthy Campus and 3Set reports.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing an increase in students who are registered as having a mental illness in higher education institutes.  That does not include students with sub-clinical needs but who may need mental health supports throughout the year.  We all have mental health and should be able to access supports easily when they are needed.  While the launch of initiatives such as Togetherall is helpful, it should be in addition to core funding.  After all, the aim of Togetherall is to meet a sub-clinical need.<\/p> <p>  A requirement of students applying to college through the disability access route to education, DARE, scheme is the provision of diagnosis by a consultant psychiatrist only.  Ireland does not maintain an adult mental health service waiting list.  However, it is widely accepted that were such a list to exist, it would be long and growing.  This would be something similar to the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, waiting list, which is exceptionally long.  Many young people who are already engaged with psychology services are forced to join the end of psychiatry waiting lists because their current treatment provider is not permitted to verify their diagnosis.<\/p> <p>  Allowing psychologists to certify diagnoses for the purposes of DARE would not only reduce psychiatry waiting lists, but would also allow the higher education sector to take a step closer to being more inclusive, and is something that Union of Students in Ireland, USI, would fully endorse.  USI supports the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI's call for equity of funding for all trainee psychologists, including educational psychologists, and for an increase in places available on trainee courses to increase the number of mental health professionals in Ireland to a level that can meet demand, both on campus and across the country more broadly.  USI calls for a change to DARE and in-college accommodations through disability services to move from only accepting a diagnosis from psychiatry to allowing a diagnosis from a PSI-accredited psychologist.<\/p> <p>  Best practice recommends increasing peer support to increase both mental health supports on campus, and to support student engagement, thus reducing drop-out levels.  Work has also begun, both nationally and internationally, in examining the prospect of embedding well-being into the third level curriculum.<\/p><p>However, the issue to date here is that the majority of this work has been at local level in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>way, not always centring the student voice in the development of such programmes.  The Union of Students in Ireland recognises the continued work to increase student participation and the student voice in student mental health work across the sector is vital and must be done in a non-tokenistic co-creation approach.<br\/><br\/>National co-ordination, collaboration and funding is needed to help these programmes to grow in a way that works for each campus.  The recommendations in the 3Set report, including, but not limited to, the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, should be fully implemented and sufficient funding allocation  to allow for this must be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, is the only union in Ireland that exclusively represents workers in higher education.  We represent many grades of workers, including lecturers, researchers, tutors, teaching fellows, librarians and administrators.  IFUT understands quite rightly that much of the focus of this round-table discussion on mental health supports in schools and tertiary education will be framed in the context of student needs.  Therefore, we will focus on issues for employees in this sector that adversely impact on their mental health.<br\/><br\/>In recent months, IFUT welcomed the opportunity to appear before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in relation to the funding requirements of higher education.  The committee published the report, The Future Funding of Higher Education, in July 2022.<br\/><br\/>In relation to today's topic, that report contains many contributions from parties who operate in this sector which are as relevant now as then.  In particular, Chapter 8 &quot;Mental Health and Well-being Supports&rdquo; considered the current demands for mental health support in higher education.  There is a recommendation 9 there that I am sure members of the committee are interested in.<br\/><br\/>IFUT is of the opinion that recommendation 9 adequately and succinctly addresses the core issues in the university sector which negatively impact staff, students and the quality of education and, indeed, the causes of mental health issues, namely precarious employment, the continued application of the employment control framework and the failure of staffing levels to keep pace with the expansion of student and programme numbers thereby resulting in the Irish staff-to-student ratio being one of the largest in Europe.  Precarious employment and a high staff-student ratio create an unmanageable workload culture on the mental health of the people working in the sector.<br\/><br\/>A 2017 study into work-related stress within the higher education institutions, HEI, sector, the Foy report, found that unrealistic demands, lack of resources and constraints on employees lead to stressful workplaces and ultimately lead to a deterioration in mental health.  The report concluded that tackling the causes of work-related stress also makes business sense as doing so leads to reduced absenteeism, higher productivity and lower employee turnover.  A 2015 study which examined precarity and casualisation in the Irish education sector noted that &quot;Many casual workers encapsulated how they felt about their situation with negative descriptors like 'depressed', 'frustrated', 'worried'&rsquo;, 'despondent and hopeless', 'disillusioned', 'demoralised ...&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on 12 October this year about university rankings, TCD Provost Professor Doyle states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe poor staff-student ratio is directly related to the underfunding of the higher education sector in Ireland.  It is vital that Government honours the commitment made earlier this year in 'Funding the Future' [report] and increase annual core funding by &euro;307 million for the higher education sector in Ireland. <\/blockquote> <p>While university rankings are something that may appear to be arbitrary at times, the issue of student-staff ratios are a very serious matter.  IFUT has concluded that there is no systematic effort being made in Ireland to act on the recommendations contained within this report.<br\/><br\/>In the workplace IFUT is responding regularly to new precarious posts and roles being created for members on fixed-term contracts for years, and even decades.  Members' contracts run for nine months of the year but they are expected to mark examinations, engage with students and prepare for the next semester during their three months without pay.  Many of these workers are completely invisible.  They are not on staff lists, email lists or invited to staff meetings.  No one truly knows the extent of the problem of precarious employment in this sector in Ireland.  Figures which are gathered on headcount tend to count full-time equivalents, FTEs.  In the case of part-time or hourly workers, one full-time equivalent could include ten or more real suffering workers.<\/p><p>The committee recommended that the staffing levels of universities \"be reviewed urgently or by end of 2022 at the latest\".  We are fast approaching the end of 2022, but we in IFUT are not aware of any process involving any trade union for examining this issue.<\/p><p> IFUT members report a significant difficulty in making time to provide the pastoral care to students that they deserve and require.  Students may not realise that the lecturer standing before them is on a contract for three hours per week.  When a student requests a one-to-one discussion on the course content or difficulties he or she is experiencing, the student should expect support to be forthcoming.  Little do students know that their lecturers might have to run off after a class to work a second or third job to make ends meet.  This disastrous employment culture is bad for the employee, but also for the students they teach.  The unavailability of lecturers to students will contribute to stress and anxiety for the students.<\/p><p> With daily demands on their time, the ability of some employees to conduct research is curtailed.  This will have longer-term devastating consequences for the quality of the research and education that the institutions provide.  Burnout is real among academics in higher education.<\/p><p> We all know that trade union-organised workplaces are safer workplaces.  In higher education, though, there is a limit to what trade unions can do to impact the work environment without national policy supporting the workers in these institutions.  Conversations about mental health in higher education need to look not just at the supports for workers when they experience mental health problems, but at the causes of workers' suffering in the first place.  IFUT wants to be centrally involved in agreeing decent work, fair workloads and adequate staffing levels across universities and other higher education institutions.  We want to be part of shaping the solution with this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Jones","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, thanks the committee for the opportunity to make this opening statement on the topic of mental health supports in schools and tertiary education.<\/p> <p>  The prevalence of mental health difficulties is a significant issue, not just for the education system, but for society as a whole.  The two education Departments and the wider State have a duty of care not just to students, but also to staff, to support their mental health and well-being.  Education settings, whether post-primary, further education or higher education, can play a vital role in supporting students, staff and families in terms of mental health.  However, education settings cannot do this on their own.  They need support from those same families, the wider community and taxpayers if mental health is to be addressed satisfactorily.  It is also essential that support services, both inside and outside the education system, be resourced to provide specialist assistance as required.<\/p> <p>  Mental health difficulties existed long before the Covid-19 pandemic, but the pandemic has made matters worse.  The TUI is committed to supporting meaningful measures that support students who experience mental health difficulties and their teachers or lecturers who educate them but who can also experience mental health difficulties of their own.<\/p> <p>  Schools and colleges require support from relevant agencies with expertise in mental health if they are to support the affected students adequately and appropriately.  Cuts to pastoral care supports in schools, such as in guidance provision and middle management posts, have also made it difficult for schools to support students in these demanding situations.  The loss of pastoral supports such as assistant principal positions is a situation that the Department of Education has described as \"unsustainable\".  These posts of responsibility are essential in building relationships and identifying issues, especially as a mainstream post-primary teacher usually sees approximately 250 students every week.<\/p> <p>  Mental health support services in tertiary education are significantly understaffed in terms of counsellors, pastoral staff and those with special responsibility for supporting students.  This is even before we take into account the expected increases in student enrolment in further and higher education.  Additional staffing is vital.  Mental health can also become an issue for staff themselves.  Staff may encounter such difficulties in either their personal or professional lives and it is essential that adequate support be available to them too.<\/p> <p>  The TUI would like to make a number of recommendations to the committee.  Mental health in education settings should be taken seriously and appropriate investment of resources, provision of time and training should be made in it for both students and staff.  It is essential that vital support services within schools be restored.<\/p><p>This includes, but is not limited to, guidance support and middle management posts.  Significant investment is needed in out-of-school and out-of-college supports such as child and adult mental health services.  An inclusive support structure should be set up in schools and colleges with access to all the necessary professionals and referrals in a timely manner.  Staffing in NEPS should be expanded to allow for greater one-to-one direct support for students from NEPS psychologists.  We note that some additional staffing has been provided.  A trickle-down model on its own simply is not enough.  The number of counsellors and psychologists in tertiary education support services should, as my colleague from USI said, be increased to the international recommendation of one per 1,000 students.  Training should be provided to teachers and lecturers in how best to refer on students and how to interface with the appropriate services.  The HSE should allow students to access community mental health services in their local community during holiday periods and to access education settings for mental health support during term time and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Significant additional staffing should be provided to the adult education guidance service.  Learners in further education and training, FET, such as Youthreach should have access to a broad range of guidance and counselling supports, as required.  All education staff should have access to mental health support programmes for themselves and for the support of their students.  There should be access to dedicated support teams who work directly with staff and students focusing on prevention over cure.  I thank the committee for listening to this opening statement.  The TUI would be happy to answer any questions members may have.  The TUI would also like to direct the committee to the more extensive written submission we made in August, which provides more detail on the issues I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach, na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la agus na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.

The Irish Second-LeveI Students&rsquo; Union, ISSU, is the national representative body for second-level students in Ireland.  Our core aims are to provide a collective voice for second-level students and to fight for a fair education system that values each individual and allows them to reach their full potential.  Access to adequate and integrated mental health supports in schools and throughout the education system are crucial to allowing students to achieve their full potential.  The ISSU is fully committed to working alongside stakeholders to find solutions to the issues students face.  It is in this spirit that I am before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  As we are all keenly aware, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on students&rsquo; mental health.  While schools are no longer closed and mask-wearing is no longer enforced, the repercussions and aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic are still being felt by many students around Ireland.  This is not the only challenge students face.  There are countless other factors that affect their mental health and students' mental health is undoubtedly suffering in an increasingly online world.  If we are to provide adequate mental health supports for students we must also investigate the causes of mental health difficulties among students.  Students' lives can be stressful enough outside of school, but the fact of the matter is that our education system is actively damaging students&rsquo; mental health.  The reformed junior cycle has developed a more holistic approach to education.  The recently released draft social, personal and health education, SPHE, short course curriculum is evidence of this.  Recently, Department of Education inspectors found that only one in five schools timetable SPHE at senior cycle.  As per our submission, the ISSU recommends the creation and integration of modules within the SPHE curriculum in both junior and senior cycle to educate students about dealing with both their own mental health and how to support their peers.<\/p> <p>  Year after year, the leaving certificate and the CAO cause immense anxiety and stress among students.  In 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child made \"a very strong recommendation\" for reform of the leaving certificate, citing the severe stress it places on students&rsquo; mental health.  The role of guidance counsellors in helping students has not gone unnoticed; as outlined in our submission, we recommend the introduction of a direct referral route for guidance counsellors when a student avails of one-on-one counselling and the provision of funds to schools to introduce an on-site psychologist.<\/p><p>A persistent stigma surrounds mental health in Ireland, particularly among boys and young men.  It is crucial, therefore, that student engagement and peer support be improved to further support the mental health needs of young people.  Initiatives such as Jigsaw's One Good School programme engage students as partners in the creation of a better environment for mental health in their school communities.  Further development of such programmes must happen in collaboration with students to ensure the student voice is represented.<\/p><p> Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge schools and places of education are often the first port of call when addressing any mental health difficulties a students may have.  To this end, it is vital we invest in early invention and at the same time introduce mandatory mental health training for teachers and all school staff during their initial training.  This is important in ensuring we have a proactive whole-school approach to mental health.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, as with many other educational issues, mental health does not affect all students equally.  Students from the Travelling community, students of colour and those from other minority groups, including the LGBTQIA+ community, are at a much higher risk of developing severe mental health difficulties.  Alongside further mental health training, we must introduce mandatory anti-discrimination training to tackle the increased prevalence of mental health difficulties among students from minority groups.<\/p><p> Currently, mental health supports in schools are far from perfect.  Some students will require mental health supports outside their schools.  Increased investment in pre-existing services to expand capacity is therefore vital.  Students going through a mental health crisis should not be placed on a months-long waiting list to access services.  We recommend an independent report and review of CAMHS and better integration of mental health supports between the Departments of Health and Education.<\/p><p> I welcome any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anjelica Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss mental health supports in schools and tertiary education at this roundtable discussion.  It is a complex issue as the supports available to both students and staff are unfortunately quite varied.<br\/><br\/>According to a recent report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, a study by Maynooth University, National College of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin found more than 40% of Irish adults have a mental health disorder.  However, the people most likely to have a mental health disorder were younger and likely to have suffered a traumatic life event.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the members we represent, SNAs are specifically affected.  When a traumatic event occurs in a school community the first response is the arrival of NEPS at the school.  When NEPS leaves, however, it is the SNAs who assist the students in their times of need.  Often, the traumatic event is compounded for these students by their additional needs.<br\/><br\/>We must have a holistic approach to tragic events, one that encompasses the entire community, including management, teachers, SNAs, secretaries, caretakers, parents and siblings.  They all need to have access to a community-based mental health service as a tragedy is a tragedy.  There must be a more structured approach.  We have heard many personal accounts many months after a tragedy, up to eight months later.  For example, when a student passes away, a student under the care of an SNA may pull out a book or toy that happened to be the favourite of their deceased classmate and that child is brought back to the grief and loss of their friend.  While NEPS provides a valuable service, it unfortunately only deals with students in the moment and at a particular point in time.<br\/><br\/>It is vital that SNAs are given access to appropriate training and support that allow them to support the mental health needs of the students they work with.  SNAs are often overlooked in this regard, which is unfortunate given the close bond and rapport that exists between SNAs and the students they work with.  There is a lack of recognition for SNAs as a professional grade, for example, in comparison with social workers.  Social workers have a defined career hierarchy and support structure, with senior and principal social workers, which encourages reflective practice and child-centred interventions based on the individual child's needs.  Sadly this type of professional infrastructure does not exist for SNAs, but it should.  Through the introduction of school-based mental health supports at primary level, there is an opportunity to strengthen and protect the mental well-being of children while also supporting their parents, teachers and SNAs.  This could also lead to a reduction in the number of children who require specialist mental health treatment.<br\/><br\/>Staff members can have mixed experiences when dealing with their employers on the subject of mental health and well-being.<\/p><p>According to Mind, a UK-based mental health charity, more than one in five or 21% agreed they have called in sick to avoid work when asked how workplace stress had affected them; 14% agreed they had resigned and 42% had considered resigning when asked how workplace stress had affected them; 30% of staff disagreed with the statement, \"I would feel able to talk openly with my line manager if I was feeling stressed\"; and 56% of employers said they would like to do more to improve staff well-being but do not feel they have the right training or guidance.<\/p><p> As regards the Department of Education, while it has extensive policies on the well-being and health of children and young people, which are to be commended, for those policies to be realised it must support the workers who in turn will support the students and young people they work with on a daily basis.  It has fallen to the trade union movement to provide employee assistance programmes to its members, whereas this should be provided as a matter of course by the Department for all of its staff.  Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, appropriate training and support must be afforded to special needs assistants who are working at the coalface in schools along with their teaching colleagues.  However, a disparity exists in this regard as teachers can avail of extra personal days, EPV days, or as they are more colloquially known, \"course days\", whereas special needs assistants, SNAs, cannot.  As well as that Mental Health Ireland only offer their &ldquo;Mind-out&rdquo; course to teachers and youth workers.  The Mind-out programme that was developed by the Health Promotion Research Centre at NUI Galway and the HSE&rsquo;s health promotion and improvement department has been proven to strengthen young people's social and emotional coping skills and improve their overall mental health and well-being.  It is a question that F&oacute;rsa raises here today as to why SNAs have not been included in the roll-out of this programme?   <\/p><p> Barnardos children&rsquo;s charity who work with some of Ireland&rsquo;s most vulnerable families have a saying that every childhood lasts a lifetime.  SNAs want to support the totality of a child&rsquo;s and young person&rsquo;s development, but they must be given access to training and support to allow them to acquire and develop the skills to protect, nurture and support the mental health and the well-being of the students that they work with.  The Department of Education needs to recognise the valuable contribution that SNAs can make in preventing poor mental health and ensuring that all of our children and young people thrive in the school community.  I thank the committee for their time today and F&oacute;rsa are happy to answer any questions that the committee may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Honer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Honer.

I am conscious colleagues that I am the seventh speaker in a row and, therefore, I will do what I will call a little mop-up operation and the committee has the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, submission which they can consult for a refinement of the policies.   I wish to make three remarks.  Number one, we welcome the opportunity.  I love that concept developed by Maureen Gaffney - \"Flourishing\".  Well-being is something that is more than just an individual matter.  Failure to flourish at school or college is never an individual problem it is a societal problem and as Maureen has said schools are the optimal sites for responding to mental health difficulties for young people.<\/p> <p>  We have not mentioned the extent of the problem and the prevalence of the problem around the table and I think it is important.  Two major pieces of research are referred to.  <\/p> <p> In 2013, research by the Royal College of Surgeons demonstrated that by the age of 13, one in three children had experienced a mental health difficulty.  By the age of 24, that had increased to one in two.  It is clear that youth and adolescence are times when significant life and health challenges are addressed and that is the optimal time to intervene.  As Mr. Honer said, recent research by NUI Maynooth found that young people aged 18 to 24 are eight times more likely to have mental health difficulties than the older population.  It is a bit like the housing crisis talk about the \"squeezed youth\" they are really facing a barrage of life challenges.  Of course, the impact of Covid-19, anxiety, stress, depression are beginning to surface and manifest.  <\/p> <p>  We have not mentioned around the table, and I think it is kind of important, the extent of the problem and the prevalence of the problem.  There are two major pieces of research that are referred to.  First is the 2013 Royal College of Surgeons research which found that by the age of 13 one in three children had experienced a mental health difficulty.   By the age of 24 that had increased to one in two.   It is very clear that youth and adolescence are times when significant life challenges and health challenges are addressed and that is the optimal time to intervene.  As Mr. Honer said, recent research by NUI Maynooth hsa found that young people aged 18 to 24 are eight times more likely to have mental health difficulty than older populations.  It is a bit like the housing crisis we talk about the 'squeezed youth'.  They are really facing a barrage of life challenges and of course the impact of Covid-19 anxiety, stress, depression are beginning to surface and manifest.<\/p> <p>  We are here today because committee members are legislators and they inform and make policy.  I always think it is good to come with a shopping list because the committee needs to know how it can help given it is genuinely concerned about these social problems.  From ASTI's perspective, there are a number of core areas that the committee needs to intervene in quickly.  First, the committee needs to address the situation as regards guidance counselling in schools.  Teachers are contracted to teach 22 hours, the allocation ratio for guidance counsellors in a school of 500 pupils is 18 hours so they are not even getting a full-time guidance counsellor.<\/p><p>The allocation ratio has to be changed in light of that as it has been around for the past 30 years. Second, according to research I picked up this morning from the Institute of Guidance Counselling that they conducted this year, in 10% of the schools they surveyed the guidance counsellor was not practising as he or she was too burned out.  Some 22% schools had unqualified internal staff filling the role and 26% of schools had external advisers coming in to fill the role.  We have a crisis in the guidance counselling service that has to be addressed.<\/p><p> The other crisis is in area of the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  CAMHS is a brilliant service if one gets into it.  It is a bit like the health service.  The waiting list is absolutely critical.  We have waiting lists for up to 18 months.  That is completely not the way to sort out the problem of a child with a mental health issue.  There is also the variability across the regions and there was a dreadful incidence of other issues in the service last summer.  <\/p><p> I like to think politics works and I was impressed by the way this committee heard from Dr. Paul Downes from the Dublin City University, DCU, Disadvantage Centre last year.  He made a compelling case about the need to supplement the guidance counselling service in schools with emotional counselling and therapeutic supports to address the mental health issues manifesting among young people.  I urge all Oireachtas Members to look at Dr. Downes's 2017 research on a sample of young men who are homeless in Dublin and the reasons for their homelessness and as someone who works for teachers and is very proud of our education system, how they fell through the gaps in the system at second level.  It is truly sad but can be remediated and I urge committee members to look at that and at the recommendations he has in it.<\/p><p>  Mr. Duffy had made the point in respect of school leadership that we need more posts.  Teacher training is essential and we have a further crisis in teacher training in that teachers are now not able to get a day out of school to go to necessary training because of the supply issue.  When these crises are not addressed, they become much more complex to solve.<\/p><p> Mr. Jones addressed a topic that is under-addressed when we talk about well-being and mental health, which is the whole area of teacher well-being.   The 2015 guidelines for well-being in the junior cycle make the point that student well-being starts with staff.  They are on the front line of the work and it is hard for them to be genuinely motivated to promote emotional and social well-being if they feel uncared for or burnt out themselves.  Perhaps this is an area the committee may wish to look at into the future.  We need to address the issue of well-being among our teaching workforce, including at third level.  It is at a really serious level.   Naturally I would have lots of other things to say but I will conclude on that.  We did not get around to curriculum, which is a vital area for intervention for youth mental health but we are not just here to talk; we are here to listen and to respond to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Leydon.

The mental health pressures faced by young people cannot be dealt with in schools alone.  There is no question of that.  The pressures they face come from all aspects of society and we could have a big discussion about whether it is the loosening of the binds of community, the pressure of exams and whatever perceived success is, all kinds of other things and social media.   This is beyond the remit of the committee but the fact is our CAMHS system is so profoundly under-resourced and struggling so badly.   To give an example that I think the speakers will be familiar with it but for anyone listening in who is not, I have come across instances where there are young people who are self-harming but are believed to have inadequate suicidality to be admitted to CAMHS.  That is a person with a severe crisis who is very much at risk and cannot access CAMHS.  That is the situation we have and it is important to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  There are challenges and pressures but we do have opportunities in schools.  Every child should be attending school so there are opportunities there and a lot of good work happening.<\/p><p>There are challenges and pressures that go with schools but we have an opportunity.  Every child attends or should attend school so opportunities are available.  A lot of good work is happening and is welcome.<\/p><p> This is not a question.  I agree with the point Ms Hughes made about the inequality that exists for educational psychologists.  That needs to be addressed because a lot of labour by educational psychologists is not being adequately recognised or properly supported.  I also agree with the point Mr. Honer made about SNAs not having the flexibility or opportunity to take additional days.  My questions are primarily for the INTO and the ISSU.<\/p><p> I will ask the INTO about the new programme which I welcome.

Is there any scope for early intervention or emotional well-being resources or do those perhaps exist?  I am looking at the time and conscious I need to allow some for responses.<\/p><p> Ms Foley is the person here representing those currently in the school system.

Guidance counselling is available at post-primary level but that is perhaps a different animal from what is being talked about in this pilot.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.

That is the short answer to that question.  We look forward to it.<\/p> <p>  I will flesh out an choncheap faoi phobal.  When we engage with the special education section and others in the Department of Education and look for services to be co-located in schools we are told that Government policy is to provide services by the community, in the local health service or via GP practices.  My experience as a primary school teacher and as a principal is that if we had something co-located in schools children who are at huge risk are more likely to engage.  Most children come to school every day.  Their parents bring them to school.  It is valuable for an at-risk child and an at-risk parent to have somewhere they can come to do both and where the child does not have to be moved out of the building.  There are models of good practice from the UK, Iceland and other countries where we have seen this working well.  We would like to re-examine the concept of community.  For many pupils community is the school.  The school is at the centre of the community in many rural areas.  Our official definition of community is too narrow in this context.  The school should be central to that definition of community.<\/p> <p>  There are certainly many programmes running in schools that are hugely beneficial.  We are at an exciting stage of the development of a new curriculum at primary level and there will be opportunities under the wellbeing specification and a lot of good work will be done, but a therapeutic service cannot be replaced for a child who needs it.  Teachers are not psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors or therapists and while they can create, as I was told 40 years ago, an atmosphere of psychological safety in their classroom, they cannot recreate a therapeutic setting.  They need support to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>The provision of guidance counselling in schools varies, as my colleagues pointed out previously.

I am sorry; it is never a healthy political attitude to have.  We will call on the Minister to extend it.  I referenced the prevalence of mental health difficulties.  Adolescence is the prime time for these difficulties to manifest.  If we are not in a space where adolescents can get early intervention and support, that is a failure to help because that is when they need it.  They also need it later on, but getting in there now we have remediation, as distinct from dealing with a much more serious problem.  We will be going formally to the Minister for Education and talking about the model and what the plans are for second level.<\/p> <p>  Going back to Dr. Downes's work, the key points are not that radical.  They are about the transition from primary to second level, the gaps that exist and the staff in schools being unable to deal with challenging behaviour.  Therefore, there is a vicious cycle of suspensions and expulsion.  They are also about students who have no self-belief or self-esteem and therefore are poor learners and failing.  Many of these issues can be addressed with appropriate resources in schools.  We come before the committee all the time and we say that we want more resources, but this is the nub of the problem.  There is an under-investment in schools.  Teachers are not mental health workers.  We are not putting other professionals in place in the school setting to address the holistic needs of young people.

I will make some comments before Ms Foley expands on some of the issues she raised.  Much of what she said has resonated with many of us here.  The Irish education system is almost uniquely set up to have mental health challenges within it.  We separate children on the basis of religion and income and we separate them more than any other European country seems to.  From my own experience, I know that children are coming to the school gate hungry and possibly having not slept the previous night or witnessed things that they probably should not as children and then facing the scenario of an oversized class with a teacher trying to balance all the needs of those children.  We have one of the largest class sizes in Europe.  It is coming down however and that should be acknowledged.  It is a reality in the classroom.  The SNA, as Mr. Honer rightly said, is under-appreciated in the system and is struggling for respect.  There is an absolutely traumatic change at the most vital time, as Ms Leydon rightly said, in their formative years when going from the primary school setting to secondary school, with a complete change in the ethos and the exam-driven atmosphere.  You are trying to tackle issues like homophobia or transphobia in a school.  You have to worry about what the patron body has to say about those matters because we have a disproportionate number of schools under religious patronage.<\/p> <p>  Ms Foley made a point about the new junior certificate being a welcome development.  The resistance to that change was something the Department had to grapple with.  When we speak about leaving certificate change, I hear resistance to that and a determination to go back to where we were.  Within all of that we must pay tribute to teachers, SNAs and those working in schools who do their absolute best to mind the mental health of the students in front of them.  There are gaps between what the HSE provides and what the Department of Education provides.  Often, children fall between those gaps.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on one thing with Ms Foley, namely, exams at second level because many issues have been raised.  There is a focus on exams.  The teacher has 40 minutes to deliver the programme and there can be pressure from parents about what the teacher is doing and how the targets are being met.  Everything seems to come down to the junior certificate results and then, of course, the leaving results and the pressures associated with that.<\/p><p>Can Ms Foley expand on that and maybe feed into what we all hope, certainly from my point of view, will be a changed leaving certificate and a changed system at second level that allows the space for a young person to be themselves and not to fit into this very rigid old exam that suits some people?  Of course, one knows that people that it suits tend to make the rules when they move on from second level but those who it does not suit do not tend to make the rules.

I sat my leaving certificate this summer and, as I am sure the committee is aware, all of us here have sat our exams.  At the moment, due to the pandemic and the changes, it is more stressful than ever.  Students, whether they are high or low achievers, are always stressed.  Right now there are students around the country who scored maximum number of points and still did not get the places they wanted.  They still did not get their first choice.  Can one imagine the stress those students face?  Can one imagine the stress a student faces when it comes to the Central Applications Office, CAO, and waiting for those results as well as for junior cycle students who until last week did not know when they would get their results?  Exams will always be stressful but there is so much we can do to make them less stressful.  It is really important that we do not just consider the students.  It is also really important that when we are making these changes, we speak to the teachers too.  In Ireland we have one of the best education systems in the world and it is not just because of what we are teaching students but because of the relationships that teachers and students have.  Students and teachers and the pastoral care system mean that students can build a real connection with their teachers and<i>vice versa<\/i>.  That is really important with mental health supports, that is, that students can trust their teachers and<i>vice versa<\/i>.  Reform is important but it is really important that when we talk about reform, we talk to everybody to encourage positive change so we do not have to reform it again so drastically in 20 years' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anjelica Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Does Ms Foley find at second level that the exam pressure is there from day one until the day one leaves and that it is unreasonable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#P00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>That is fair to say for students when one thinks about the leaving certificate system.

I want to focus on two things.  The first is the resources.  It is important that every time witnesses come before us that they raise the importance of resources so that it gets into our reports.  Nobody wants to hear that schools are not funded enough and that teachers do not get the kind of training they need.<\/p> <p>  The second thing is training.  There was a real call for further training for teachers from today's witnesses and the witnesses who came before the committee last week.  That has come through loud and clear from all of the opening statements today.  I have come from a National Women's Council briefing on education around relationship sexuality education, RSE, and healthcare.  The call there was for further training and professionalisation for social, personal and health education, SPHE, teachers, for instance, in order to be able to deliver what is now quite complex.  Society has become really complex and young people are dealing with that.  As F&oacute;rsa pointed out in its opening statement, 40% of adults have mental health challenges and that starts out somewhere.  That starts when people are really young.<\/p> <p>  Do witnesses think it is about focused teacher training for some subjects like SPHE or do they think it needs to be across the board?<\/p><p>As I said last week, teachers are sometimes a little like GPs.  Everyone comes to teachers although they might not be the people qualified to deal with a particular issue.  They are the conduit to send people in the right direction.  Should mental health training be provided to all teachers?<\/p><p> Second, I will focus on the lack of services for teachers to direct pupils to.  It is all very well to understand that someone is experiencing a mental health crisis but everyone in this room will recognise if there is no one for teachers to refer pupils to, they will be left carrying the can because of the relationships they build with young people.  I welcome any thoughts the witnesses might have on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#P00900","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>What I will say is similar to some extent to my answer to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question earlier.<\/p> <p>  The three main issues the Senator hit on are vitally important in the area.  One is being able to access CAMHS and adult mental health services as we are also talking about tertiary education.  Any comments I make of CAMHS, adult mental health, NEPS or any other service, is not the fault of the staff.  They are simply dealing with waiting lists that are utterly unmanageable, but timely referrals are needed.<\/p> <p>  Pastoral staff in both colleges and schools are vitally important as the Senator rightly referenced.  We have many reports of guidance counsellors in schools doing a fantastic job often in difficult circumstances.  My colleague from the ASTI mentioned that some schools do not have a whole-time-equivalent guidance counsellor.  Many cases are referred to us of guidance counsellors holding on to students who have levels of need that the guidance counsellor knows she or he cannot manage.  There is nowhere to refer the student to so it is the case that holding on is better than doing nothing.  This is not a criticism of the staff in NEPS who do a fantastic job but they are swamped.  NEPS staff members need to be on the ground with individual students.  A trickle down model serves a purpose but it does not solve the problem.<\/p> <p>  Third, as the Senator stated very well, training needs to be available to all teachers.  There is a teacher supply crisis and releasing people for training will be difficult but it must be available to all teachers.  Continuous professional development, CPD, is vital, but no matter how much CPD we do in this area, teachers will still not be psychiatrists or psychologists.  In the past few days we encountered an issue about assessment of needs.  No matter how much training teachers do, they will not be occupational therapists.  Therefore we still need to be able to refer students to experts and as many services as possible need to be close to schools so students can be referred, but I must re-emphasise that services must be available in a timely manner.  Telling students that the local service will help them in 18 months time is not ideal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>At primary level we have a generalist rather than specialist model.  I made the point the other day to someone that initial teacher education takes between four and six years depending on which model a student follows.  Some people are in a classroom for 40 years after qualifying.  We must provide our teachers with CPD.  It should be available at all stages of their careers, kept up to date, based on best practice and on evidence-based models.  I reiterate what Dr. Duffy said about needing specialist help.  Schools and teachers cannot solve all of the ills of society.  We must have services.

Training needs to be provided for SNAs as well as for our teaching colleagues.  It should be provided for all colleagues in the school setting.  As I said in my presentation, this is not a criticism of Mental Health Ireland, but it is just a fact.  If one goes on to Mental Health Ireland&rsquo;s website to access the MindOut programme, there is a tab for teachers and a tab for youth workers, but there is no tab for SNAs.  SNAs should be able to avail of the training if they want it.  If they are armed with that skill set, they will be better equipped to deal with students in their times of crisis.  I would agree with the Senator completely in terms of training.

Anyway, moving on.<\/p> <p>  It is always important for people who have experience, even as a politician or whatever, to draw on that experience and say that they know what they are speaking about.  When I was just 11, I was in a very bad accident.  I lost my mother a few days before that accident.  There were no supports around counselling or trauma in school, which led on to some anxiety and depression that still exists today because it was not dealt with when I was a young person.  Those supports are well needed for young people today.  In one sense, we are moving as a society because of the teachers, the SNAs and the professionals that we have now within our education system, who see that we should not be taking part in shaming people with mental health and trauma issues.<\/p> <p>  I know that in its investment for the budget, one of the INTO's recommendations was to invest in mental health.  We are doing much talking around mental as a society, but we are doing very little action around young people and mental health.  Again, we talk about some of the organisations.  Some areas such as Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Inchicore and Cherry Orchard do not have the same level of mental health services as other more upper-class areas, if you want.  I am aware that mental health does not have a class.  However, there are different levels of pressure around people from, say, communities such as mine, namely, the Traveller community from Ballyfermot.<\/p> <p>  One of my questions is directed at F&oacute;rsa and the INTO.  Would it be fair to say that DEIS or disadvantaged schools would need more mental health services than non-disadvantaged schools?  The SNAs are lifesavers to a certain extent in our schools.  Sharing the Vision states that the training is there for teachers.  For example, if there is a young child in a wheelchair in a school, he or she has an SNA.  The SNA is the carer and educator.  They take on so many roles, as well as the teacher.  It is important that we include our SNAs in the training.  There are so many different levels of training that are expected for our teachers, for example, training in Traveller culture, other cultures and mental health.  SNAs are carrying out the job on very low wages as well.  They did not go to school to be professional psychologists; they went to be educators.  There is a difference.  That was the one question about disadvantaged schools.<\/p> <p>  I have a question around the barriers of being diagnosed with a mental disorder or any kind of disorder that young people would have in primary or secondary school.<\/p><p>What kind of positive impact would a diagnosis at a younger age have on a young person's life?  I am sick to the teeth of pilot programmes that do not work or even if they do work, do not get implemented.  I know the witnesses have the answers but how do we implement those answers?  It is not about reinventing the wheel.  We are not geniuses saying this is what we need to do.  The answers are already there.  Obviously, money is a big part of it.  How do we turn them into actions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#R00300","speaker":"1657","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments and her support for SNAs.

We hear them time and time again.  We cannot hear them often enough but very little happens in terms of implementation.  It is frustrating from our point of view so it must be frustrating from the witnesses' point of view when they see so little movement yet they present all the solutions here today.  We do not need enormous reports or pilot projects.  Like everybody, I am tired of pilot projects.  It is not just a case of me being tired of them, it is the money we waste when we do not use what we learn from the pilot projects.  It is very frustrating when there is no in-built evaluation and streamlining of those projects.  I have been involved in some of them around mental health, bullying and other topics and I think we need to think long and hard.  I know it is an attractive proposition if somebody gets some money to do a pilot project but I wonder whether we are all colluding in keeping things where they are.  Those were some of the ethical questions - even for myself - around working in community development.  To what degree were we colluding in that system?<\/p> <p>  My first question is directed to Ms Behan.  Obviously, the solution is core funding.  Core funding in third-level education has to be fixed.  It also relates to what Mr. Jones was saying about staffing as well but without the core multi-annual funding, we are just not going to fix this problem.  There is no skirting around it.<\/p><p>While it might be politically expedient to announce one project or one pilot project after another and to get the headlines for a couple of days and then go off on our merry way, if we do not fix what is under the bonnet then we are not going to fix this at all.  When Ms Hughes said that there was \"standing room only\" on the waiting list, how many of those people standing there could not wait or did not wait to get the supports and services they needed?  We are dealing with people's lives here, as all of the witnesses know.<\/p><p>Ms Hughes said the total funding for on-campus mental health supports was &euro;5 million in 2020-21 and again in 2021-22; for the past three years, the mental health budget has stayed the same.  However, &euro;3 million is announced each year as additional funding.  There are figures being played around with, which is nonsense.  That needs to be called out.  We are a cross-party committee.  Mental health for young people is more serious than any political party on its own.  We need to call it out, whether within our own parties or whatever to stop this from happening.  While the ability to announce the funding each year as if it is new money is politically beneficial, how disruptive is it to providing a proper service on-campus when they cannot be planned properly and organisations do not have the resources on a year-on-year basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#S00500","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  It is exceedingly disruptive.  The money that was provided last year for Covid-19-related additional supports went unspent in a number of colleges for one of two reasons.  First, because it was one-time funding, only a year's contract could be offered.  There is a dearth of people who can apply for these jobs and that is not an attractive job posting.  It is hard to fill a position like that.  On top of that, many campuses do not have space to <i>ad hoc <\/i>hire two or three more counsellors for a year and then have them go off again.  That was a situation we were faced with last year.  Regarding the campus I referred to where there was standing room only on the waiting list, the head of counselling there told me they have two sessional staff they do not know if they can keep on beyond the end of November.  If that happens, they have five staff, I think, so that is almost half of their staff gone.  That has an obvious knock-on impact not just on the number of students that can be seen but also on the roll-out of things like the national suicide prevention framework.  It does not have a specific staff member allocated for the roll-out, so it falls onto staff like counselling staff, who have to juggle their session loads and the roll-out of multiple frameworks at this stage.

We advert to these statistics, as we should, because they are published by researchers.  We need to interrogate that figure and what it means for our society.

Would the witnesses support a policy that reserved 50% or 60% of college places in the areas of psychology, pharmacy, speech and language therapy, medicine, etc., for people who are ready to work in Ireland for a defined period?

Although clinical psychology training is funded, only a small number of spaces - I believe there are approximately 36 in the country - is available.  It was even harder for undergraduates to access those courses that were not funded until the recent budget as they had to self-fund.  I know the Psychological Society of Ireland feels the same way.

Over the generational cycle we see it operating in a defined sense.  There has been discussion in the media recently about the number of health graduates emigrating.  It is a complex issue.  We need to know more about why they are emigrating.  Why are conditions in our health service seen as so unattractive that they lead people to decide to emigrate?<\/p> <p>  We have not given sufficient support to the national plan for equity of access to higher education which is now in its second iteration.<\/p><p>We tend to base our projections for entering into higher education on school leavers but as a society, particularly for the human sciences like the therapies, health, social services etc., we need to see how we can encourage more workers who have experiential knowledge of problems in real-life settings to go into further learning, particularly at higher education level.  It is very expensive, particularly if you are not earning and have a family to raise.  While I would perceive there being a problem out there, we need to see what are the pull factors, including those of other economies and jobs, and what we can do as a society to make sure we get more people into these jobs.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, made a successful pitch recently - he said we should stop looking at school leavers going into third-level education as a solution to all of the skills problems in this country.

Resilience is very important.  When we consider the factors that contribute to mental health difficulties for students, it is interesting to look at students with enduring mental health.  By that I mean students who have not encountered a mental health difficulty.  There are many factors at play.  When we look at schools, we should consider them not only in an educational context but also in the context of other experiences of schools, which can lead to students being more resilient in their mental health.  Factors such as sport, being on the student council and the friends a pupil makes at school are all part of the support circle that will build resilience.

I welcome that we have been able to bring so many of the representative groups and unions to speak to the committee about mental health.<\/p> <p>  A number of the members of this committee also sit on the education committee and like me, on the mental health committee, which is a brand-new sub-committee of the health committee.  We see many concerns being raised, especially during the two years of lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I have a few questions which I will pose and hopefully allow some time for a short response.<\/p> <p>  I agree with a point mentioned by the witnesses in their submissions that the transition phase is crucial, especially going into first class, first year and from secondary school to third level.  I agree that transition period is a huge issue and note that Ms Leydon of the ASTI also mentioned it.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions about the summer programme.  It is about the investment we are now seeing coming from the budget into education.  Some &euro;9.6 billion is going to education with almost &euro;2.6 billion going to special education.  We will have almost 40,000 new staff, that is almost 20,000 SNAs and almost 20,000 special education teachers coming into the system.  Mr. Honer is representing SNAs at the committee.  I want to see the courses that UCD is rolling out being rolled out around the country.  We will tackle getting 20,000 people their well-deserved qualifications.  That has to happen.  The Minister is aligned with how we see that being rolled out.  As I represent the Roscommon-Galway area, I want to see much of it in the west.<\/p><p>I refer to the number of people who are coming into the school system and how that has been managed as a teaching staff.  There is a cohort of teaching staff working with the special education teachers, including the mainstream teacher in the classroom and the SNA support.  I would like to see it being more streamlined and I see that in schools I deal with in my area on that level.  Does Mr. Honer have any more comments on that?<\/p><p> I might ask our guests from the ASTI and the INTO some questions about the summer programme.  We have just announced funding on that and we are seeing one quarter of schools taking part.  I have contacted schools in my area and I have good feedback from a number of principals about the impact of those two weeks, particularly for those schools.  Are there any other challenges?  We have a budget and we have this extra capacity coming to schools.  They have also opened up the possibility that student teachers and different cohorts could be involved.  Will we see anything with schools coming on board this year?  It would be great to see a real increase in that.  Are there any other challenges in that which we need to be conscious of?  That bringing students in over the summer period helps with the transition piece.<\/p><p> The funding models, pilot programmes and so on are crucial because most initiatives we see come from pilots.  The initiatives we have seen at third level came from pilot programmes.  We are seeing technological universities being rolled out, which has been amazing in delivering excellence to the regions.  We have spoken about mental health supports here but we have to look at how we deliver health in a different way.  Much of this is now coming through telehealth and is being accessed in a virtual way for early intervention.  We need to look at changing how we deliver healthcare at an early stage sometimes.  I would be interested to hear comments on that as well, because the 50808 text number is a 24-7 one that is crucial for anyone going through anxiety or any type of stress.<\/p><p> The changes we see in the roll-out of the leaving certificate programme are something else we have been fighting for.  It should not all be pinned on one exam and that does not deliver for all students and for all capacities and capabilities.  We have the action plan on bullying and this committee did a report on that, which was one of our first reports.  The Minister for Education has taken on board a number of elements of that.  There has also been &euro;5 million rolled out for that for primary schools.  There has been an increase in NEPS with about 54 more psychologists coming on board in that.<\/p><p> My questions begin with the summer programme, particularly the transition and how we increase the number of schools taking on that programme this year when we have the funding available for it.  I also invite comments on the engagement with CAMHS and community teams that has been mentioned.  How do we set up a structure where the secondary school system can engage with our new disability teams in the community space, particularly in the community healthcare organisations, CHOs?  On the counselling supports and the action plan on bullying, each school has an ethos and parents sometimes have to look at what the ethos of each school is.  In the inspector's annual report, reference is being made to how bullying is being managed in each school.  With this new recommendation from the action plan, we will hopefully see this.  What are the witnesses&rsquo; comments on that?  How will schools engage in that action plan on bullying and how will they manage it?  These are the matters I see as being of interest.  I might start with the transition and I invite Ms Leydon to speak on that from ASTI's point of view.  Mr. Honer might come in on the SNAs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#W00900","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>We might discuss that briefly because I am conscious that we have to suspend to bring in the next group and that we have to be out of here by 2 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I have to defer to my INTO colleague because second level is not the dominant space where the July provision is provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Can I ask Ms Leydon if secondary schools cannot provide this or why secondary schools will not provide this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00400","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>It is not that they will not provide it but the facts of the matter are that many of the students whose parents want them to attend the July provision will be students with significant disabilities-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I do not think it is just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00600","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>-----and quite often many of those students would not be in the second level system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I disagree to some extent.

The successful delivery of the examinations annually depends on a broad coalition which includes school managers and leaders; teachers, including retired teachers, who are fulfilling critical roles; and the education stakeholders.  The SEC recently announced Wednesday, 23 November as junior cycle results day.  We acknowledge that candidates and their families may be disappointed that the date is later than might have been expected.<\/p> <p>  We hope to provide the committee with details of what is behind the delay in issuing results and of the efforts made, in collaboration with stakeholders, to address the most significant issue, which is a shortage of teachers to mark the examinations.  This meant that marking in all subjects was not completed during the normal summer marking window.  The results of the leaving certificate issued on 2 September, with the appeals issued five weeks later on 4 October.  The deferred leaving certificate ran until 16 July for candidates who missed their examinations due to bereavement, serious illness or Covid-19.  Additional time was also needed to give effect to the commitment that the results on aggregate would be no lower than in 2021, which was achieved through a post-marking adjustment.<\/p> <p>  The later leaving certificate results issue date has had an impact on the junior cycle timeline.  Changes to the leaving certificate appeals timeline in 2019 saw an October date for the junior cycle results for the first time, by agreement of all of the stakeholders.  This year, if the marking had been completed, the junior cycle results would have been due to issue to candidates at the end of October.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of examiner supply, pre-pandemic, the SEC had been experiencing significant difficulties in attracting, recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of teachers to undertake this vital work.  Up to and including 2019, it was necessary to put in place a range of remedial measures to complete the marking within expected timeframes.  The challenges we are faced with are evident from the statistics; the SEC traditionally recruited 4,000 examiners to mark the written examinations.  This year, fewer than 3,000 examiners marked the work of 130,000 candidates.  Allied to demographic increases, candidate numbers are 12% more than they were ten years ago.  The number of examiners involved in marking the examinations is almost 19% lower than it was ten years ago.  Junior cycle candidate numbers have increased by 5% since 2019, while the number of examiners has decreased by 30% this year.  With the support of stakeholders, the SEC has made repeated and extensive efforts to recruit examiners in sufficient numbers for the 2022 examinations.  These efforts included online advertising and marketing to teachers and schools including in teacher union publications; appeals to principals to take on a leadership role in encouraging and supporting this work; appeals to subject associations and support services such as the professional development service for teachers, PDST, and junior cycle for teachers, JCT and thousands of direct telephone calls and emails to teachers who had examined previously.  Significant increases to payment rates were approved in recognition of the co-operation, flexibility and support needed.  Leaving certificate rates increased by between 17% and 50% per script, while junior cycle rates increased by between 48% and 57% per script marked.  A recruitment campaign called \"Earn, learn and understand\" highlighted the many professional and financial benefits of this work.<\/p> <p>  Despite these efforts, the numbers fell short and a range of interventions was needed to complete the marking of most subjects during the summer, which included marking well beyond the normal marking window and examiners agreeing to take on additional scripts.  These measures, while necessary, put pressure on the examining teams and contribute to a poor examiner experience and impact retention.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to complete the marking in all subjects.  Further contingency arrangements have been made to ensure that the marking will be completed in the coming weeks.  Unlike in the summer marking period, most of the teachers now marking are in schools during the day and only available at evenings and weekends.<\/p> <p>  The commission has an absolute responsibility to examination candidates to ensure that their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity.  Over the past three years, due to the circumstances created by the pandemic, delivery of the State examinations has been extremely challenging with many changes required to ensure delivery of the service.  The ending of Covid-19 restrictions and the return to examinations as normal have exacerbated an issue which existed before the pandemic, one which challenges the management and completion of the marking and the ability of the SEC to issue the results.  The SEC is extremely grateful for the co-operation it receives from thousands of teachers each year to undertake critical work in the State examinations, noting that this is voluntary, subsidiary employment which teachers undertake during their school holidays.<\/p><p>Recruitment and retention of teachers as examiners is not only a whole of organisation issue for the SEC, it is a major and urgent whole of system issue at second level.  Addressing the issue requires regular engagement with key stakeholders and the active support and involvement of all the players, especially school management and teachers' unions, as well as the continued support of the Department of Education which has already provided improved examiner rates.  The SEC will be reviewing with stakeholders how best to ensure the availability of teachers in the required numbers to engage in this critical work in the future.   Our objective is to substantially increase the number of teachers involved so that the experience is a positive one which greatly enhances teacher professional competence as well as earning power.<\/p><p> On a positive note, the rate increases which were introduced on a once-off basis in 2022 have now been assured for 2023 with the assignment of an additional &euro;11 million on budget day to maintain these increased examiners' pay rates.<\/p><p> My colleagues and I are happy to respond to any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#Z00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Feeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I want to confirm that we did not receive the opening statement last night.

Later examinations were held for adult learners and early school leavers.  They were held in November with the results issuing in February.  Arrangements were made through SOLAS in order that those students could progress in the absence of their results.  We have been in contact with SOLAS to see if a similar arrangement can be put in place for this year.  That is a work in progress at the moment.  In regard to further engagement with both teacher unions, yes the examinations over the past number of years build on a strong relationship that the SEC had with stakeholders including the teacher unions and the school management representative bodies.  We have engaged through the advisory group on examinations planning and in bilateral meetings with the stakeholders just before Covid-19 and during Covid-19 and on these particular issues over the past year.  We have had much support from the teacher unions in terms of encouraging and supporting the campaigns that the SEC has put in place such as advertising in the teacher union magazines and directly reaching out to branch representatives on behalf of the State examinations system to try and increase the numbers getting involved.  In regard to the other measures that need to be put in place, the rates are quite significantly enhanced this year.  That has had an impact.  There are other factors in play.

The SEC came with the figures around the increase in the number of students and the decrease in the number of examiners.  Each year that there is a decrease in examiners, the experience of the examiners gets only more difficult, making it more challenging year-on-year to get new examiners in.  Where I come from, there was a leaving certificate student who, due to the timing of the leaving certificate results, was not able to access a place in a UK university.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been working with the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, on some of those issues.  That is a huge challenge in general for students accessing places.  That student has now taken a year out and will, I hope, be able to apply and be eligible - because they are eligible - for a place in that university.  That was due to the timelines we have here.

Will the witnesses tell the committee what budget has been allocated?  How much has been allocated for future development and digital strategies to support how we are going to manage this in the future?  If the SEC is having challenges and we cannot open up the pool of teachers to do the examination process, how are we going to streamline and accelerate digitalisation to support the elements which can be digitalised?

Our budget and allocation for 2022 is &euro;77.395 million.  In a normal year, we would collect an additional &euro;10 million in fees, but there are no fees for the examinations this year.  On technology and what we have done, the figures we shared are quite stark as regards the increase in candidates and the more than matching decrease in the number of examiners.  We have invested in digitisation of the examinations over the last number of years.  Some 410,000 results were issued this year at leaving certificate level.  Of those, 389,000 were either fully or partially marked using our online marking system.  There is no doubt that the online marking system and that transition to online marking has assisted us in managing the challenge of a decreased examiner supply.  It makes the experience of examining much more straightforward and streamlined for the teachers involved.  That is one aspect of digitisation.<\/p> <p>  We made continuous improvements across all of our services in the last number of years with greater use of our candidate self-service portal.  We also have a school portal for the transaction of electronic and digital course work from schools to the SEC.  All of those things have greatly enhanced our capacity and efficiency as an organisation.  Given what we as an organisation have been asked to do over the past number of years with the considerable changes each year since 2019 due to the pandemic, we have responded in an agile fashion to meet those challenges.  On what the future will hold in relation to senior cycle reform, there is a mandate within the senior cycle reform announcement to look at opportunities for digital assessment.<\/p><p>We already have an element of digital assessment in computer science, digital course work as I mentioned, and computer-aided design that is used for design and communications graphics coursework.

A very small number are held in June, but most of them are held in March, in springtime, so things are done differently.  Within those jurisdictions, particularly France, marking examinations is part of the teaching contract.  It is something examiners as teachers do, not every year, but they rotate and have an obligation to do it every three years.  It is done differently, so I think we need to look long term at our processes.

The number of examiners who marked junior cycle in 2019 was 1,756.  The number who marked junior cycle this year was 1,270.  However, at leaving certificate level, the numbers kept pace.  The numbers in 2019 and 2022 were similar.  That was very deliberate on our part.  We prioritised the marking of the leaving certificate in the assignment of examiners to the marking teams as we recognised the importance of the leaving certificate results to the students involved as regards progression.  I am not saying that the junior cycle results are unimportant but the leaving certificate results are important for students progressing to further and higher education and to the world of work.  The priority in the assignment of examiners was, therefore, given to the leaving certificate.  We want to increase the number of examiners available across the board so that we do not face this challenge at either leaving certificate or junior cycle level.

We have very few examiners working with us who have a long distance from the classroom and are out of it for 20 years.  What we are very conscious of is that we are very grateful to our retired examiners, because they bring a huge amount of experience, in particular to our senior examining teams as well.  We are conscious of that in terms of the robust training that we provide.  Very detailed resources are provided to all examiners.  While retired teachers can be distant from the classroom, equally, there is an issue with newly qualified teachers who have not clocked up the miles in the first place.  We provide very robust training materials and exemplars.  There is a lot of marking done on sampling material at the marking conferences in order that we are sure that we can robustly support and stand over the marking by all our examiners, not just retired or newly qualified ones.  Again, we have the quality assurance processes throughout in terms of getting material.  As I mentioned to Senator Dolan, the move to online marking is pretty much instantaneous.

We must look at all the issues you mentioned, Chair, such as childcare, the fact that teachers have young families and that they have made a lifestyle choice and a career choice that is compatible with their family responsibilities.  We must look at the range of factors with the stakeholders and see how we can strike a balance so that the time demand for teachers getting involved is perhaps reduced so that there are more teachers doing this for a shorter period of time.  That is the objective that we have.  We want it to become a beneficial experience as well as one which increases their earning power.

In terms of what it would do at a logistical perspective for the SEC, I do not know.  I would have to give it some time to think about it.  It sounds to me like it could be quite disruptive to have examinations happening two months earlier in the school year.  If the students did their examinations in April instead of in June, what happens to them for the rest of the two months of the year?  It might be hard in terms of engaging at that point in time.  It is a question I had not considered previously.  There are teachers in classrooms at the moment who are very capable of giving advice about their level and also the subjects that they plan to take, and they do so.  That is for students who have gone directly into fifth year.  A lot of students go into transition year and they have the time they need to make up their mind.

Perhaps \"qualify\" is the wrong word, but that experience might be beneficial.  In my time, it was much more difficult to get that post than the actual examiner post.  It might be something worth thinking about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#MM00400","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>It is an interesting suggestion.

By now, members have already have heard the calls to action to avert catastrophe.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the catastrophe has already arrived and a rapid escalation of humanitarian aid into areas facing famine is needed.  While I am reading this statement,12 more people will have died in east Africa due to lack of food and related complications.<\/p> <p>  Since May of this year, estimates of the number of people across the world who will experience crisis levels of hunger in 2022 has risen from 181 million people in 41 countries to 345 million.  The G7 says 323 million people are on the brink of starvation.  The global hunger index released last week confirmed that hunger levels are reaching catastrophic proportions, with 44 countries suffering with serious or alarming levels of hunger.  There is no doubt but that the numbers will increase, given the millions displaced and lives up-ended in another recent climate crisis in Pakistan.  That we are experiencing an unprecedented global emergency is undisputed.  <\/p> <p>  I am joined today in person by R&eacute;iseal N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair of Concern Worldwide and Colm Byrne of Tr&oacute;caire.  I am very pleased to also be joined by Paul Healy, Tr&oacute;caire's country director for Somalia,and Dominic Crowley, Concern Worldwide's emergency director, who is also speaking to us from the region.  <\/p> <p>  Before I hand over to my colleagues, I will give a short update of what has changed since we last met the committee in June.  Back then, we said that one person was dying from hunger every 48 seconds in the Horn of Africa.  Now it is estimated that one person is dying every 36 seconds.  Back then, we knew there was a possibility the next rainy season due to start this month would fail.  Now we know for sure that this has happened, leaving communities facing into a fifth consecutive season of failed rains.  This is an historic situation by any accounts.  Back then, we warned that despite our help, hundreds of thousands of children would die for lack of food and adequate nutrition.  Now we are seeing children dying daily, many of whom have arrived too weak and too ill to health centres after long arduous journeys with their families.  <\/p> <p>  That anyone anywhere is dying of hunger in 2022 is unacceptable.  That any child would spend its first years knowing nothing but hunger should shock us all into action.  In recent months, both the Irish people and the Irish Government have acted.  The recent visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to Kenya and Ireland&rsquo;s announcement that it would allocate an additional &euro;30 million to the situation in the Horn of Africa for 2022 are to be particularly welcomed, as is the announcement of increased funding for overseas development aid in budget 2023.  On that, I thank the committee for its support and engagement with us and with the Government.  As with all funding, we ask that the release of such funding be expedited or more lives will be lost unnecessarily.  It is vital that Ireland continues to show solidarity with those who are living through the worst drought in 40 years.<\/p> <p>  COP 27, which takes place in two weeks' time, presents an opportunity to accelerate our global ambition to tackle the climate emergency and to place climate justice and human rights at the heart of climate action.<\/p><p>Climate security is now a critical issue that requires new thinking and new solutions.  No country in the G20 is decarbonising quickly enough to maintain a safe climate and that is putting more lives and livelihoods at risk, in particular in countries such as Somalia that have done little to contribute to the problem.<\/p><p> A critical issue for the communities with whom we work is that of loss and damage.  Countries in the global south are experiencing massive losses and damages from climate change impacts and have the least financial and technical resources to cope.  This is diverting much-needed public finance for sustainable development into dealing with the crises and is pushing countries further into debt.  It is a matter of climate justice that richer countries including Ireland contribute to and support the development of this third pillar of finance under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC. <\/p><p> We are asking all the committee members here today, as well as all Oireachtas Members, to support our call to action to Ireland, that is, to release flexible multi-year funding to meet the current humanitarian needs and that those funds reach as many NGOs and local organisations as possible who are the front-line responders; to continue to grow Ireland&rsquo;s budget in line with our commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI on official development assistance, ODA, by 2030; and to advocate at the UN Security Council and in relevant international forums for accountability for those who seek to use starvation as a weapon of war.  We ask Ireland to support the scale up of investment in social protection programmes and sustainable livelihoods to protect and strengthen hard-won development gains.  Last, we ask Ireland to support the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility at COP 27 and to follow the lead of other countries such as Denmark, and to commit initial loss and damage finance, as a sign of leadership on the issue.<\/p><p> We need political action and leadership to prevent this catastrophe from getting worse. Each day of delay exacerbates human suffering, increases the scale of the crisis and raises the cost of the response.  I will now hand over to Mr. Paul Healy who will speak about the reality on the ground in Somalia.  He will be followed by Mr. Dominic Crowley, after which my colleagues and I would welcome input from members and will answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":376,"content":"<p>It is a pleasure to be here and I thank members for taking the time.  Every week over the past six weeks I have been in Gedo and every week, I have seen children die or have heard the following morning that a child had died during the night.  Every week we are hearing of mothers and children coming into Dolow and Luuq in Gedo, having walked for a week or two weeks and barely having enough strength to get to our facilities.  Children have died on their way and have been buried on the side of the road in shallow graves because the parents or the mother is too weak to dig a deeper grave.  The situation is apocryphal and it is catastrophic.  In this day and age, it is a complete political failure and more needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  In 2011 we said, &ldquo;Never again&rdquo;.  Political leaders, UN agencies and others said, &ldquo;This will never happen again&rdquo;.  Now in 2022, it is happening all over again.  It is a political failure.  We are appreciative of the steps and the leadership taken by the Irish Government and Irish Aid in supporting the crisis in east Africa but more still needs to be done.  One would hope that there is leadership for Europeans and others in the global north to address this crisis.  Already we are too late for thousands and thousands of people who are going to die in the coming weeks or have died in the past few weeks.  Women and children in particular bear the brunt of this.  Over 80% of the people coming into internally displaced camps are women and children.  They are exposed to significant malnutrition as well as the risks of sexual exploitation and abuse.  Half a million children are currently starving in Somalia and 1.8 million children are reaching that point, along with 500,000 mothers who are pregnant or lactating and are struggling to survive and unable to feed their children.<\/p> <p>  A large reason for this is that climate change has not been properly addressed.  We have seen over years and years the global north exploiting the resources of this planet.  The people of Somalia have done little to contribute to that and yet there is little or no compensation to the Somali people for the consequences that they are now facing.  Some 3 million livestock animals have already died in Somalia.  A whole way of life has been destroyed.  It is simply unacceptable in this day and age to stand back and to not take heed of the consequences of our actions over decades. <\/p> <p> There are solutions to this if we act now.  Immediately, there are life-savings solutions.  We are deeply appreciative of the leadership and support of the Irish Government, the Irish public and Irish Aid but other long-term solutions need to be put in place that I hope COP27 will address and in which the Irish Government will take an active part.  As already has been said, we need multi-annual and predictable funding for durable solutions for sustainable livelihoods to try to address the impoverishment of people in the global south, particularly here in the Horn of Africa, where whole livelihoods have been destroyed and possibly forever.  I also appeal to the Irish Government to consider again the commitments that we have made over decades to the 0.7% of GNI.  While the current response is deeply appreciated, we can do more as Irish people.  The idea is in our DNA and in our historical memory that the poorest, the most marginalised and the most left behind should not be forgotten.  I make the passionate plea to the Members of the Oireachtas and to all the Irish public to take leadership and to show the compassion that is our historical right and is in our memory.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to it.  I will cover some of the same ground that Mr. Healy has already covered so my apologies for that.  As Ms McKenna has said, I am in Nairobi but I got in yesterday evening from Mogadishu.  I want to talk a little about the situation in Mogadishu and in Baidoa.  The time that I spent in Mogadishu and Baidoa gave me the opportunity to speak with our staff, with NGOs, both national and international, with the UN and with the minister for humanitarian aid for the state in which Baidoa lies.<\/p> <p>  The one message that everyone gave me is that this is the worst crisis in living memory.  It is worse than the famine in 1992 when Mary Robinson famously made her visit.  It is worse than the famine of 2016-17.  Between them, those two famines killed between 500,000 and 600,000 people.  It is unimaginable, as we have heard already, that we are facing another crisis of at least the same order of magnitude, not least because we have been shouting about the danger of this for the last 18 months.<\/p> <p>  I will speak about the things that I saw while I was in Mogadishu.  I visited a stabilisation centre in Banadir Hospital, which is the national referral hospital for mothers and children.  The ICU in the hospital would break your heart, with desperately emaciated children with multiple health complications as a result of acute malnutrition.  The admissions into the unit have more than doubled in the last couple of months and are running at more than twice the number for the same period last year.<\/p><p>We are helping as much as we can.  On the day after I visited, the slab was poured for a new unit that is being created.  The unit will only accommodate 45 children.  As the crisis deepens, which we all know it will, the capacity is inadequate for the level of need we will see.<\/p><p> I also visited one of our mother and child health, MCH, clinics in Mogadishu.  They were so overloaded by the caseload in the last couple of months that we have had to open a second MCH clinic close by.  The caseload is manageable but they are operating at very close to full capacity.  The focus in these clinics is on children under five and pregnant and lactating mothers, looking at giving them nutritional and health support and at giving health education to the mothers.  Standing inside the clinic, the youthfulness of the mothers was bluntly and brutally obvious.  One of the common distress factors we see at the start of a crisis is that young girls are married off to take them out of a household and remove the burden of having to feed them.  We saw that in Mogadishu and in the camps in Baidoa.  Even our national staff are surprised at how young these women are who are giving birth.<\/p><p> The first time I was in Baidoa was almost exactly 30 years ago, when I responded to the 1992-93 famine.  The situation is at least as bad now.  There are approximately 500,000 people living in camps north and south of Baidoa.  The population of the camps is greater than that of the town.  When we talk about camps, these are not formal, structured centres.  They are incredibly basic shelters of branches cut from trees and covered in sheets, blankets and, in some cases, tarpaulins.  This is where people are living.  Cooking is a couple of rocks outside with firewood put into them to try to cook on pots out in the open.  Water is provided from tap stands like that depicted on the slide.  Women and children queue to collect water in jerry cans.   That is their water for the day.<\/p><p> The image on the current slide is one I stole from Voice of America.  It depicts Baidoa camp.  To the front is a big grey slab, which is the water bladder.  That is what we fill at the start of each day.  Once it is emptied, it is more or less gone for the day unless we can get more water to it, which is becoming increasingly difficult.  Four wells out of hundreds dug in Baidoa in recent years remain operational.<\/p><p> We have had four failed rains.  We are facing into the fifth rain failure.  As Mr. Healy stated, 3 million livestock have died.  The land has become so dry that no crops have been planted or harvested.  Even if rain came, the soil is too hard for it to percolate effectively.<\/p><p> No discussion of Baidoa is complete without discussion of the role of al-Shabaab.  The women with whom I spoke said one of the main reasons they fled their areas - and, as Mr. Healy said, people walked for seven to ten days to get to this set of camps - was they were afraid their children would be conscripted.  The boys would be taken in to be al-Shabaab fighters and the young girls passed on as brides for older fighters.  They said that even if the rains came, they could not go back because the threat to their children remained.<\/p><p> This is measles in the camps and an uncontrolled outbreak of measles will kill children very quickly.  If we get rain in such unsanitary circumstances, we will, at the very least, get an increase in malaria and, in all likelihood, in serious waterborne diseases such as cholera.  At the moment, aid to the camps is pitifully low.  If people feel forced to migrate again, they will do so in a weakened state.  It is questionable as to how many of them will survive the journey.  Baidoa's nickname in Somali is \"Baidoa Janaay\".  It is far from that at present.<\/p><p> I do not know if people have seen or read the report from Andrew Harding that came out a few days ago.  It is well worth watching.  It tells the story of the first of the two little red bundles on the bed shown on the current slide.  It is a two-year-old boy.  This is the story of his death.  In the time before he died, he weighed 4.6 kg, not much more than a well-fed child at birth.<\/p><p> The issue of funding has been mentioned.  The UN appeal has increased to $2.27 billion.  This seems like a lot but, rationed out among the people who are supposed to received it, it equates to $440 per person.  The appeal has received less than half, 47.3%, of the funding.  This equates to $160 per person for the year, and that is to provide shelter, food, water and health.  It is woefully inadequate for the level of need we face.  It is no wonder the number of people in acute need of life-saving interventions is increasing dramatically, when we fail to provide the basics these people need.  If there is a bright light in this situation - and it is difficult to find - it is that the US has been responsive and provided 67% of all funding made available to the humanitarian response plan of the UN.  It is not the only funding mechanism, but it is the most important one.  We welcome the recent commitment from Irish Aid to support the response in the Horn but far more engagement is needed from all donors if famine and further unnecessary deaths are to be averted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Crowley, Ms  McKenna and Mr. Healy.

The witnesses' figures, stats and video clips are shocking.<\/p><p>Ms McKenna stated: \"While I am reading this statement,12 more people will have died in east Africa due to lack of food and related complications.\"  All of those figures were shocking, including that the number who have experienced crisis levels of hunger is up from 181 million people in 41 countries to 345 million now.  It was also stated that at one point in the Horn of Africa a person was dying from hunger every 48 seconds.  A few months later, a person is dying every 36 seconds.  It is no harm to read that into the record again.<\/p><p> This is a shocking horror story and it behoves us to do something about it.  It hits education and it hits women and children more.  All of those points are valid.  Ms McKenna mentioned speeding up aid and the money getting out there.  The committee will support that.  If there is anything we can do about the matter, including going to the Minister or whatever it takes, I would be in favour of doing it.  We should go on increasing the money for aid.  This is an emergency and there should be an emergency payment.  We have problems in Ireland but nothing in this compares with our domestic troubles so we should be supportive.<\/p><p> I was going to ask a few quick questions.  Ms McKenna stated, \"We ask Ireland to support the scale up of investment in social protection programmes and sustainable livelihoods\" and \"we ask Ireland to support the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility at COP27\".  Ms McKenna might elaborate on what exactly that is and if there is anything we could do in that regard.  The rest of it is self-evident and before I finish I want to indicate my support.  Any sane response to this would be that we should support the expedition of an increase in aid.  We should do something about it immediately.  I propose that we might go to the Minister especially on this or do whatever it takes to effect some change on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#D00300","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for giving so freely of their time.  There is no easy way of saying this, but I felt physically sick when I read the opening statement and saw that one death every 48 seconds is down to one every 36 seconds.  Naively, I had hoped, against all the evidence that it would hold somewhere in and around where it had been and that the increase in the number of deaths would not be as severe.  However, that lays bare, in very stark terms, the challenges that exist and the huge impact this is having across the countries that have been mentioned.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask some specific questions and then to dip into COP27.  When Mr. Crowley was speaking I was minded of the five usable wells left from the hundreds that have been dug.  Is the loss of those wells solely to do with climate change and the ground drying out or are there any other impacts involved?<\/p> <p>  In the run-up to COP27, I have been reading, as most people have how it is being framed as an African conference.  I would imagine that is being done in some ways to draw more attention to the crisis emerging there.  I am seeing and hearing about all this enhanced collaboration and new strategies.  In the context the countries that are most closely involved, the neighbouring countries and Egypt, is the urgency that seems to be expressed by them being reciprocated by others?  Is that same understanding being reciprocated through the actions of other countries?<\/p> <p>  The Santiago Network was established at COP26.  This was broadly welcomed at the time in the context of the loss-and-damage initiative, but are we seeing any meaningful outcomes from it?  It would be seen as a more long-term approach but are we seeing anything come out of that?  What I am hearing from the witnesses is that there have been pledges of support, some of which have yet to materialise, that there are short-term actions that need to happen now and that there are longer-term strategies required.<\/p> <p>  I also watched Andrew Harding's news report.  It broke my heart as a parent and a public representative.  Where the pledges of support are not coming through, is there anything we can do on the international stage to encourage them to come through a little bit stronger and more quickly?  Between the long-term strategy and the urgent need, what role can Ireland play in ensuring that the immediate need is met on an immediate basis?<\/p> <p>  I agree with everything that has been said about the disproportionate impact events like this have in the context of gender.  Whether it is sexual exploitation or abuse, additional resources are needed for pregnant women and nursing mums.  What can we do to address these issues?  We have increased the levels of aid and we have seen that we have a good international reputation in Irish Aid and overseas development.

If I said there are five wells, I meant to say there are four.  Apparently, there are only four usable wells in Baidoa.  That is for a combination of reasons.  The wells tap into the aquifer and the aquifer is not being replenished because the rains are not coming.  The Deputy heard that we have had four and a half failed rains, which we expect to become five, and that there has been no opportunity for the aquifer to be replenished.  As a result, there is no water to tap into.  The second aspect is the sheer volume of population.  You cannot increase the population of an area by 150% and expect scarce resources to spread widely enough to meet the extra demand.

We talk about ODA and international development assistance and we talk about this being equivalent to 0.7% of gross national income.  In addition to ODA we talk about climate finance.  Climate finance is for climate adaptation and mitigation.  The origins of the discussion around climate finance go back as far as 2009 in Copenhagen and were reinforced at COP21 in the Paris Agreement of 2015.  Climate finance is a commitment by the richest countries in the world to provide $100 billion to the least developed countries that are least able to respond to the challenges of the climate crisis.  The ODA target is 0.7% of gross national income and Ireland is only meeting half of that obligation.  We have climate finance for adaptation and mitigation and Ireland has committed &euro;225 million for same.  So far, we have only provided &euro;90 million.  Some estimates suggest that we should be providing as much as &euro;900 million per year.  That is 0.7% ODA, as much as &euro;900 million in climate adaptation and mitigation and then we have the separate issue of loss and damage.<\/p> <p>  Let me give the committee a practical example of what we mean by loss and damage.  If you can imagine that if you are living as temperatures rise, mitigation would be the opportunity to provide air conditioning to your house.  Adaptation would be the opportunity to get drought resistant seed, which would enable you to grow crops which are more conducive to the warming environment.<\/p><p>Loss and damage is what happens when it is no longer possible to adapt and mitigate.  It would be the equivalent of someone's house no longer being usable or inhabitable and their land no longer productive.  Our ask, as an aid community, is that Ireland should provide 0.7% and should move towards that target.  We should make those commitments in terms of climate finance.  This is an opportunity for us to provide a form of progressive leadership to the international community, particularly within the EU and among the world's most developed states, by making a landmark commitment to loss and damage.  Denmark has already set the standard.  It has provided a small amount of funding, equivalent to &euro;13 million.  This is an opportunity for Ireland to make a statement in advance of COP.<\/p><p> Deputy Clarke asked what we can do.  This is an opportunity for Ireland to provide leadership, to be the first and to demonstrate to others, in advance of COP27, what is possible and that we are committed to supporting loss and damage.  The Deputy mentioned the Santiago Network.  The Santiago Network is an opportunity to provide technical support to countries in addressing climate change, climate adaptation and mitigation.  The challenge is that it is equivalent to having an architect but having no money to build the house.  It is technical support but there is no financing behind it.  The ask is 0.7% plus the climate finance and the loss-and-damage funding, but the real opportunity is for Ireland to stand apart within the international community.  We exist at a time when the multilateral system is failing.  Many European countries are already starting to reduce aid budgets.  Ireland has taken an important step forward by increasing it quantitatively.  As others go low, it is important that we stay high, continue on this positive track and set the standard for others to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":387,"content":"<p>There was a commitment from the international community, originating back in Copenhagen in 2009, with regard to climate finance.

The 2011 famine killed over 260,000 people.  As Mr. Crowley outlined, it has now been two and a half years without rain.  That is not just in Somalia but in the wider region, including parts of Ethiopia.  It is good to have the ambassador from Kenya here today as parts of Kenya are also very badly affected.  South Sudan is experiencing extreme flooding.  The action needs to be that we no longer treat this as business as usual.  We can see that the climate crisis is coming.  It is affecting people now.  It is a game changer in terms of how people can survive and how to replace people's livelihoods.  It is also coming on the back of the Covid crisis, which had already rolled back 20 years of development.  The emphasis needs to be on humanitarian funding, as Mr. Byrne said, but also on the longer term bilateral investments with countries that are struggling to provide levels of social protection and rebuild livelihoods for people.  We need to look right into the future.  This crisis in Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa is not going to be solved in six months.  A large caseload of people who were displaced in 2011 in similar circumstances due to moving away from conflict-affected areas are still displaced because it was not possible for them to go back to their land.  We have to look at the package and take a long-term view.  It is also important to acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to allocate &euro;30 million to the Horn of Africa after his visit.  It it very welcome.  As a strong principle leading donor, Ireland can also influence other donors.  As Mr. Byrne said, there are roll-backs across the board from countries that are reallocating humanitarian assistance for domestic costs.

Mr. Crowley said this is the worst famine in living memory, worse than 1992.  I remember when Mary Robinson was out there and she broke down emotionally when she met people in the camps.  You can understand why.  I note from some briefing documents that the threshold may not yet have been reached at UN level for an official declaration of famine.  In the name of God, what is the threshold if we are not at it already?  If the UN did declare a famine, what difference would it make?  Would it make a difference?  I know some work has been done but it has been vetoed by some countries at UN level.  The Security Council has its own issues.

A declaration does not make any difference to that child or that mother.  It does not make any difference to the suffering of people.  Months ago, I said that we are already mitigating the impact of famine.  It is already here and is already expressing itself.  Yes, some of the indicators have not been completely reached, but that depends on the famine review committee having the ability to measure specific indicators and having the time to do that.  They only do that over a period.  We are waiting for the next assessment and collection of data from the famine review committee before that famine is declared, but the crisis is now.  Perhaps members will recall that 100,000 people died in 2011 before famine was declared.  We certainly want to try to avoid that happening again.  We want to avoid mothers and children starving in Somalia and wasting away to nothing as we wait for this amazing declaration.  It is not good enough.  We must do more.

When we talk about famine we talk about IPC, which is the integrated food insecurity phase classification.  This system was created a few years ago to try to get us past the argument of whether this is a famine or is not a famine.  The problem is that this is extremely conservative in its estimates and, as Mr. Healy has noted, is that it measures things retrospectively.  By the time a famine is identified it is already well under way.  The specific challenge, generally speaking, in proving IPC level 5 is to identify the retrospective mortality data.  One is trying to look backwards and trying to assess how many children have died in the previous period relative to a nominal baseline of child mortality.  That is extremely difficult, not least because, as Mr. Healy has said, when one sees patterns of distress migration, which is when people try to move from one area to another in search of food, that is when one sees the highest rate of deaths.  It is then almost impossible to identify the graves subsequently.  At the moment in Somalia, the World Health Organization is trying to look at that retrospective mortality data, but whether it will come up with accurate information, and whether the information it comes up with will be sufficient to meet the threshold, is very questionable.  I 100% agree with Mr. Healy in saying that this is totally academic.

It is to imply that people should suffer but that there is a certain level of suffering at which we suddenly draw a red line and say \"This is enough\".<\/p> <p>  On the resistance to loss and damage, I must say that it is the EU, the US, and Australia and others.  Part of the resistance is a refusal to acknowledge the historic accountability and the risk of litigation.  The establishment of a loss-and-damage fund in some ways would replace that.  It is about trust in many ways.  Ultimately, however, it is about accountability.<\/p> <p>  The question was asked about what parliamentarians can do.

When we think of the mitigating measures we had to take in the recent budget in order to respond to the issues arising out of supply chains being affected by Covid and by the war in Ukraine, and the impact this is having on the cost of living and when we consider that we can do that to the tune of &euro;11 billion and not borrow a cent to do so, we realise that as badly off as we think we are, how very much well-off we are when compared with the terrible difficulties and tragedies experienced by the people to whom our guests refer.<\/p> <p>  As a committee comprising members from all parties and none and representative of the people who give us the privilege of being here as Members of the Houses, we have a duty.  Our guests are right to say that we have an obligation to impress upon Government to acknowledge the commitment it has made, to acknowledge the increases there have been, and to acknowledge - following the visit on behalf of the Government by the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy - the announcement of an immediate &euro;30 million put aside for that region.  We must also acknowledge, with regard to climate financing and the &euro;95 million against &euro;225 million, that this compares far more advantageously than the 25% across the international community.  That is not to say that when one makes a commitment one should not stand by it: one should not make commitments unless one has the capacity to do so.  Our job will be to impress upon Government the need to be expedient in relation to the commitment it has made as a Government: to use its influence in the fora to which it is party, both within the EU, within the UN and within the Security Council and to ensure that our Government's representation at COP27 has at the top of its agenda issues relating to climate finance and loss and damage, as you have alluded to.  We will do our utmost to do that expediently ourselves, and to immediately contact Government to relay the shock and horror that is obvious in the voices of the responses and sentiment of those members that are here, in the hope that our people as a whole recognise that no matter how difficult things may seem, it is a far cry from the presentations that have been given to us on behalf of those you wish to support here today.  I thank all of the witnesses again for their honesty, their brevity and the detail relating to difficult news that they had to convey.  We will ensure that we will live up to the responsibilities that have been charged to us in relation to our commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Vice Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":415,"content":"<p>On behalf of all of the organisations that are members of the D&oacute;chas, I express my sincere thanks to this committee.

We started with Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown Council and Dublin City Council.  We met with Galway and Cork County Councils last week.  Today we are joined by Mr. Daniel McLoughlin and Mr. Colm Ward from South Dublin County Council and by Ms AnnMarie Farrelly, Mr. Robert Burns and Ms Mary Egan from Fingal County Council.  You are all welcome.  I thank you all for the opening statements which have been circulated to the members.  You also submitted your housing delivery action plans.  The purpose of these meetings is to look at the historical delivery of housing and the different types of housing that have been delivered over the last couple of years.  It is also to look at the projected delivery in line with Housing for All.  We agreed this morning that we will have a couple more meetings after which the committee will put a report together, and submit it with our recommendations and observations from engagement with local authorities.<\/p> <p>   I will read a brief note on privilege before I ask for opening statements.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  For witnesses attending in the committee room, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Before we hear opening statements, I want to explain to our witnesses that we take it in seven minute segments.  That means members have seven minutes to ask questions and receive answers.  If we stick to those seven minutes we can sometimes get in a second round of questions.  I will start with South Dublin County Council followed by Fingal County Council.  I invite Mr. McLoughlin to make his opening statement on behalf of South Dublin County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Is it okay if I go briefly over the opening statement?

The housing delivery shown in our opening statement is for the period 2017-2021.  The committee asked for three years but we included five to give a better feel for the comparison between that five year period and the current one.  We delivered 2,392 units, and 5,300 housing assistance payment, HAP, households also benefitted from housing accommodation policy.  The leap going forward in terms of step change is very significant where we are looking to provide 3,699 social homes and 1,566 affordable homes.  The significant step change is largely associated with the introduction of Housing for All and the introduction of the affordable sale and cost-rental streams.  In our case that is assisted by two significant issues.  One issue is the substantial block of funding of approximately &euro;186 million of the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, for the Clonburris strategic development zone, SDZ, which will allow for the advance development of all enabling common infrastructure.  Clonburris SDZ is a housing project for 8,500 homes, and South Dublin County Council has 2,500 homes within that.  That is really important, as is the additional financing of resources and the fact that we have, in the last five years, gone from developing smallish sites ranging from ten homes, to the biggest one, which I think was 90 homes.  That is a lot of firefighting, planning permission and contracting and site management.  We are going from that into managing about a half dozen sites, the smallest of which will comprise maybe 300 to 400 units at a time.  Those three issues are facilitating that step change, and that represents our ambition for the next five years.  <\/p> <p>  We have considerably increased our activity with regard to right-sizing.  There is a confluence of issues for us, one of which is ageing demographics that is common across Ireland, and particularly in parts of south Dublin inside the M50, one of the older suburbs in Dublin city and county.  There is also a degree of analysis by Tallaght University Hospital around this.  Our age friendly committee through my colleague, Mr. Ward's team have also done work around it.  The numbers going forward are fantastic in terms of life expectancy and so forth but demanding in terms of the State.<\/p> <p>  Alongside that we have significant issues around under-occupation of social homes, which comes to about 1,100 or 11%.  People obviously have the right to reside in those homes.  What we are trying to do through our right-sizing policy is encourage people voluntarily to move within their own locality to a right-sized home, providing they are comfortable with that and it fulfils their life expectations moving forward.  There will be no obligation on anyone to move.  We also have one site under construction, three sites at the tender stage, and four sites at the planning stage.  That is eight sites all together, ranging in size from about 12 to 16 in terms of small clusters of housing within existing communities.  We also have two or three larger developments, including one for 80 apartments.  That is it on right-sizing.  We also have a right-sizing policy that allows people to buy into it from private housing on the surrender of their homes.<\/p> <p>  On Part V, the statistics speak for themselves.  On vacancy and dereliction, as a local authority administrative area, we have the lowest vacancy rate in Ireland over the last two census periods.  That is reflected in the lack of activity on repair and renew and on the various Government initiatives.  For our part, we have brought derelict properties back into use, including three for social housing and two for lease.  There are also four derelict properties in one location going through the compulsory purchase order, CPO, process under the derelict sites Act.<\/p><p>Broadly speaking, that is a synopsis of the opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members for the invitation to address them today.  We have a good track record in Fingal of delivering social homes for the county.  Since 2019, we have delivered in excess of 5,000 units.  Of those, 847 were direct build and the figures for other forms of social housing can be seen in the paper we submitted.  Looking ahead then in terms of Housing for All we are committed to increasing our social housing delivery.  We work with all delivery partners to ensure that housing is available for everybody in society.<\/p> <p>  As part of the Housing for All plan, we have developed a housing action plan 2022 to 2026.  It sets out the details of all social housing delivery for the next five years.  It summarises the current and projected housing delivery which will be delivered to meet the targets set for the council by the Department.  The table provided outlines the delivery targets for 2022 to 2026.  That is a total of 3,640 units over those years and 3,286 of those are to be direct build.<\/p> <p>  The council plans to deliver a total of 361 new build social homes this year and that is against a target of 360.  It is committed to delivering the target of 690 new builds for 2023 and targets of more than 700 new build social homes for the subsequent years up to 2026.  Fingal County Council has been proactive in the delivery of social housing and over the past three years the council has provided housing solutions for more than 5,000 families.  This has been through a range of delivery mechanisms, including new build, leasing and the housing assistance payment, HAP.  <\/p> <p>  Having said that, the last few years have challenging.  Covid-19 has hampered the building of new houses.  It has caused disruption to the construction sector and hindered supply chains.  The high construction price inflation and market uncertainty have also impacted housing delivery.  However, Fingal County Council is committed to delivering good quality social and affordable homes for our citizens and to achieving all the targets set out.<\/p> <p>  To meet the significant challenges of delivery set out in the Housing for All plan, the council has an ambitious housing construction programme delivering both social and affordable housing on its own land banks.  The table provided sets out the projected pipeline to 2026.  In the period 2015 to 2021, 536 social housing units were built on council land.  Moving ahead, the pipeline is 1,933.  That includes a combination of construction on site and those that are in the planning stage and in the pre-planning stage.<\/p> <p>  Part V delivery continues to be an important delivery mechanism.  A total of 405 new social homes were delivered under Part V in the period 2019 to 2021. A further 116 dwellings are in the pipeline to be delivered in 2022.  There are currently a total of 609 active construction sites across the county with a total of 2,932 units under construction.  New Part V social homes will be coming from those private sites.  The future social housing provision of Part V is dependent on delivery by the private construction sector.<\/p> <p>  In advance of the introduction of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 and the regulations, Fingal devised a pilot affordable scheme at Dun Emer in Lusk, delivering 39 affordable and 12 social homes.  These homes are scheduled to be delivered by year end.  The next development will be on site in Hayestown, Rush, in the coming weeks delivering 52 affordable and ten social homes.  The first phase of delivery on our major land bank at Church Fields, Mulhuddart, Dublin 15, is currently at procurement stage.  This phase will deliver 108 affordable purchase and 80 cost-rental homes. <\/p> <p>  There are four cost rental schemes approved under the cost rental equity loan, CREL, scheme being delivered by our affordable housing body, AHB, partners.  These schemes are scheduled to deliver 14 cost-rental homes this year and 170 in 2023.  Working with our partners in the Land Development Agency and the approved housing bodies, it is expected that more than 3,000 affordable homes will be delivered in Fingal in the period 2022 to 2026.  The table provided outlines this projected delivery by each partner.  That is a total of 3,079 units.<\/p> <p>  The delivery of accommodation for older persons is a priority for the council.  A scheme of 30 apartments specifically designed for older people was delivered last year in partnership with Fold Housing.  A further 31 homes will be under construction by Tuath Housing on the council owned land bank in Lusk this year.  The council is currently drafting a pilot right-sizing scheme which will accommodate both social and private homeowners.<\/p> <p>  The preliminary census 2022 data indicates that Fingal has the second lowest vacancy rate in the country at 4.28%.  It is likely that many of these properties will not be vacant when the data is further analysed.  Since 2019, a total of 70 privately-owned properties have been brought back into occupancy.  That is through the repair and lease scheme, the buy and renew scheme, compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, and through the private market.<\/p> <p>  The council also recognises the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme, particularly the refurbishment grant scheme of a maximum of &euro;50,000 which will bring some of those properties back into use.  The council has a full-time vacant homes officer in place since April 2022.  The officer and the team will deal with the 85 vacant or potentially vacant, private dwellings that are at the various states of investigation, engagement or action.  Some of the properties are in the process of going through probate or conveyancing or may be subject to repair or form part of a planning application.  The council is actively tracking the progress with these properties and expects they will return to occupancy as the various processes reach conclusion.  The council&rsquo;s vacant homes officer will also be participating in a pilot project with the Department and five other local authorities around the data on potential vacant properties across the country.<\/p> <p>  Fingal County Council assesses dereliction in accordance with the Derelict Sites Act 1990.  There are currently six sites with 17 properties on the derelict sites register.  The council continues to pursue dereliction by way of engagement with owners and occupiers, the issuing of statutory notices and the placement of sites on the register.  As a result, the council has engagement with the owners of all these sites.  The council hopes to be in a position to remove three of the six sites from the register in the near future.  The use of the register will continue as a means to engage with owners and occupiers to deal with matters around dereliction and the return of properties to use.<\/p> <p>  Fingal County Council continues to build on its good track record of delivering both social and affordable housing.  As outlined above, there is a significant pipeline already in place and together with our delivery partners we are committed to delivering the target 6,532 social and affordable homes as set out in the housing action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms AnnMarie Farrelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank both local authorities for being with us today.

The Affordable Housing Act, for example, is just over 12 months old so I accept some of this is planning for the future.<\/p> <p>  From an overall perspective, Dublin City Council is quite constrained in terms of land and it talked about a figure of 10,000 between now and 2026.

Currently, all of the land in our ownership is in play for those sites that are either on site in construction or whatever stage of project development they might be in.

That is in play in terms of the numbers, as are land capacity and realistic ambition.  In those confines, we have struck a good number.

It is easier to go in and build social units directly without the mixed tenure part, but it is not necessarily the right thing to do.  Mr. McLoughlin mentioned some big areas of land.  Similarly, in Fingal, we have sites that can take about 1,000 units.  One example is Donabate, which is 1,000 units on public lands and a combination private, social and some cost-rental units.  That is financed by private finance, which adds additional complexity.<\/p><p>It is in the planning system at present.  We anticipate it will go to site soon thereafter but it can take up to three or four years for that scheme to be brought through development.  Much of the work is hidden and not understood.

I will not use the term &quot;take care of&quot; but we are dealing with a situation where the approved housing bodies, AHBs, require land and we are anxious to progress mixed tenure communities across all of the various Government schemes; that gives us the best opportunity to do it, all as part of one conversation.  It is therefore worth quite a bit of pain.<br\/><br\/>When we get to Part 8 we keep talking about the public spending code and the four stage process.  Since our troubles in 2008 and 2011 we have a public spending code and all approval processes including housing, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, URDF or major capital spending<b><\/b>projects mirror that process.  In considering adjustments to that we need to reflect on the need for a public spending code and how we might deal with that or provide more agility within it.<br\/><br\/>Working against that framework, when we come through come planning we are effectively through two stages of the process.  We must then take a planning consent, which is an outline design proposal, to detailed design stage.  We have two choices.  We can design it in-house, get architects to design it or go to the market for a design and build solution.  I said two, but it is really two and a half options.  That takes 12 months either way.  During that 12 month window, we also need to carry out all of the environmental assessments, ground, archeological and heritage surveys and so on.  That is a lot of moving parts and, as I said earlier, the management of all the sub-consultants within the timeframe, some of whom are season dependent, is quite tricky.  <br\/><br\/>We then get to the detailed design stage where approval is needed again.  Then we go to tender which is a two stage process when developing at scale.  Stage 1 is to ask interested parties to put their names forward to adjudicate on their capacity and competency to undertake a project at scale.  At that point we move to stage 2.  Unfortunately there is currently a degree of hesitancy between stage 1 and stage 2.  People who enter stage 1 do not necessarily stay in the race for stage 2.  The two stage process is another timing issue.  Then we get the final tender and that has to be approved.  Then we go to site.  As regards the timescale outlined to the committee - if we assume there is a conversation in a council chamber or an area committee about a greenfield site without any development or infrastructure constraints - from concept and from broad understanding at council level to handing over a key, four years is good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending the committee and ask them to thank their teams because they are at the coal face of the housing crisis.

South Dublin County Council residents have not been shy about coming forward for the first-home shared equity scheme and I understand a number of them have already received their certificates of eligibility.  As of June 2022, construction of 4,000 homes had started in the previous 12 months and 1,000 new homes were completed in that time.  All of us on the ground in the constituency see that every day.  We see hoardings up, boots on sites and cranes in the skyline in Liffey Valley, Clondalkin, Lucan, the N4 and in the villages.  All of those sites represent families, couples and single people who will end up in those homes and that is welcome.<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses know, housing is a massive issue in our area.  It is a particularly big issue in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West and South Dublin County Council's housing delivery plans focus more heavily on Dublin-Midwest than Dublin South-West.  We are home to two strategic development zones, Adamstown and Clonburris, and nearly 70% of social homes in the council's pipeline are due to be delivered in Dublin Mid-West rather than Dublin South-West.  That is welcome and I want to ensure we get it right.  What I mean by that is that we deliver homes hand-in-hand with infrastructure and the URDF funding that Mr. McLoughlin mentioned means that the likes of the Celbridge link road will open in the coming weeks.  That will provide much anticipated traffic congestion relief in Lucan.  Funding like that is being and must be used to build roads, schools and amenities that need to come hand-in-hand with those quite large-scale projects.<\/p> <p>  Second, I reiterate it is important that we deliver the right tenure and mix of homes.  In September 2019 South Dublin County Council sought expressions of interest in affordable homes.  I was a councillor at the time and it was something I was keen to do because even then when no national affordable housing scheme was in place, we had an affordability issue in Dublin and especially in Dublin Mid-West.  Now as a Deputy one of the biggest concerns I hear from young people and their parents is that they will not be able to afford to buy their own homes.  Some 2,000 people applied for that back then and the council's housing needs demand assessment, HNDA, estimates 2,500 more people have affordability problems.  The national target is 1,200 affordable purchase homes over the five or seven years since 2019.  Is that enough and is the right balance being struck?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#D00800","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>There is a lot in that.  On the Deputy's first point, I thank her for acknowledging the work of the team and the councillors in south Dublin.  Good work is being done.<\/p> <p>  I can reassure the Deputy on the accompanying infrastructure piece.  Apart from the Celbridge link road the Deputy mentioned, she will be aware that in Adamstown we are developing two parks at scale.  One at Tandy's Lane opened last year at the cost of &euro;5 million and one at Airlie Park will open in January 2023 at a cost of &euro;5 million.  Lucan leisure centre that cost &euro;14 million will hopefully open next year.  There is much advance and retrospective provision of playing grounds and team spaces.<\/p><p>In fairness, the Department of Education has stepped up with us on site acquisition from us and other sites regarding the development of schools.  There are five cr&egrave;ches within the Adamstown strategic development zone, SDZ, where there are currently 3,500 homes.  We have our arms around that.  I appreciate that there was a hiatus in the Deputy's backyard.  There was an expansive growth area in Lucan in the Celtic tiger era that hit a brick wall in 2008 and then there was a delay.  We are retrofitting a lot of stuff there in the past five years and that is going pretty well.  <\/p><p> On the mixed tenure piece, we have about 50:50 social and affordable housing in Kilcarbery, which has 1,000 homes.  The Deputy will be well familiar that when we first tendered, the affordable housing schemes were not in place.  Since they have come in we have been able to bring on board though CREL and other schemes some affordable initiatives to rebalance that into a 50:50 situation.  Clonburris is 40% social, 30% affordable and 30% cost-rental across 2,500 homes.  We are getting the mix pretty right.<\/p><p> I will now answer on the expressions of interest piece on affordable housing and whether the numbers are high enough.  Apart from the 10% ordinarily in play, as part of the URDF, which does not get spoken about often, we got &euro;20 million in funding  in Adamstown.  Part of that proposition was an agreement for the sale of 2,000 homes, 1,100 of which had to be below a certain price point.  That has been achieved in the past three years.  As part of the Kilcarbery proposition, in the absence of an affordable scheme, we built in 50 homes discounted to the market.  As part of the URDF proposition in Clonburris we are factoring in an additional 10% affordable on top of the statutory requirement, which is an additional 600 affordable homes.  In those initiatives alone, the over and above proposition beyond the statutory 10% is quite significant.  <\/p><p> We are still exploring options and we are waiting to see whether we will have an affordable cost-rental development ourselves that has just come through tender in Belgard, Tallaght.  That will be important to us in assessing where that opportunity is at going forward and how we might make that work with assistance from the Department and if we can make it work, how it might be replicated in other locations.

The prospects on the easing of inflationary pressures and an easing of supply chain issues are positive, the latter of which is already easing.  Given where we are at as regards housing demand and housing issues we have no choice in pushing through.

There is also a lack of suitably zoned land available for sale in Fingal.  We know that and Ms Farrelly pointed it out.

There is quite a lot of detail.  On our overall housing list numbers, there are almost 14,000 - 13,811 to be precise.  The Fingal approved applicant figure on that list is 6,292.  It is growing.  I will come back to the Senator about the time on the list.  I do not want to give an incorrect figure.  The Senator asked what the impact of the social housing 10% limit increase would be.  We can come back to the Senator about that to see what the impact might be.<\/p> <p>  On the cost-rental demand, in Fingal we have projected affordable housing delivery of over 3,000 during that timeframe, which is a mix of purchase and cost-rental.  We are looking at around 2,000 cost-rental, I think, over that timeline.  It is hard to put a measure on demand.  The criteria may be slightly different for the approved housing bodies.  There is no local authority in this space delivering cost-rental yet.  It remains to be seen how soon this may operate in practice.  On the number of families presenting as homeless, there were 568 as of 18 October this year.  We have 180 families overholding on notice to quit, that we are aware of.  I referred in my earlier answer to how we are assessing or dealing with those expressions of interest.  Generally speaking, people selling the property will approach us.  They contact us and we provide the information.  We also get that information from tenants or through our HAP processes.  We would also consider it where a tenant may be at risk of homelessness but we have not gotten direct contact from the landlord.  Everything is on a case-by-case basis.  We are conscious that by not dealing with it we may be dealing with a homeless situation that impacts our services elsewhere.  It is something we are giving careful consideration to.  There are vulnerable families in need.

They are challenging environments.  They are to be commended on their great achievements over recent years.<\/p><p>It is welcome to see that, combined between both councils, between social and affordable homes, we are up around 12,000 homes.  That is ambitious and welcome, and it will go a long way to meeting the need.  The fact witnesses have demonstrated how local authorities can deliver quantum, high quality and can use State-owned lands to address the cost and affordability issues is to be commended.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses mentioned affordable pricing starting at &euro;166,000.  I welcome Deputy Gould's welcoming of the strong Government policy that has enabled delivery on that affordable price.  He should consider supporting us a bit more because you never know what we could achieve together.  On a serious note, the changed circumstances and the double digit construction inflation the witnesses mentioned is very real and anybody who is trying to do any work in their own home will know that.  Delivery of affordability into the future and affordable cost rental will be critical.  I appreciate witnesses cannot give us an actual rental price, but the fact they are working to deliver at a minimum of 25% below market rents is what people need to know they are actually doing.<br\/><br\/>In terms of increasing the output, I believe Mr. McLoughlin said it was four years from start to finish for a project.  I agree with him, and if it was four years, we would all be able at least to work with that certainty.  From my experience from a city perspective it can actually take a decade and sometimes longer, which is a big challenge for the city.  One of the big challenges in the city is the planning process, which was mentioned, and the delays the process can cause, specifically when planning permissions are objected to and are caught up in the process.  Will witnesses speak to how that is impacting or will impact on their pipelines going forward?<br\/><br\/>I would also like to ask about the homeless services.  Dublin City Council operates the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  Between the two local authorities I believe there are around 1,200 applicants identified as homeless or at risk of homelessness.  How many emergency homeless accommodations are they providing in their local authority areas?  How many of those who are on their homeless lists or identified as being homeless are actually being accommodated in emergency accommodation in the city?  If the witnesses do not have that number to hand, they can come back to me with it.  I would like to understand that.<br\/><br\/>The costs are very challenging, but the last estimate I had of the cost of emergency accommodation for a family for a year is &euro;80,000.  Is that a charge the witnesses would identify as being the cost?  It is important that, if that is the case, we keep that in mind when we talk about the cost of new builds.  No emergency accommodation is a substitute for an actual home.<br\/><br\/>As for the tenants <i>in situ<\/i>process, have witnesses instructed their housing officers to ask, when someone who is on the housing list comes to them with a notice to quit, if the landlord is selling and if he or she will sell to the local authority?  If not, would the witnesses consider doing that?<br\/><br\/>The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is being extended to the cities, something my party colleagues and I have pushed hard for.  I am concerned about the value of &euro;50,000 for a vacant and derelict property or &euro;30,000 for a vacant property in the city.  Do the witnesses think that will be sufficient to trigger a renovation and regeneration of vacant and derelict properties in their local authorities?<br\/><br\/>I appreciate there are a lot of questions, but perhaps we could start with Fingal County Council and then move to South Dublin County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#J03100","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick and I might ask Mr. Burns to come in on some of those questions.

The four Dublin authorities have addressed that in their individual ways by retrofitting social infrastructure and planning infrastructure, rather than just housing, as they go.  That is one clear point.  I will also reiterate my colleague's point that everything is local.  Whereas it may seem rather simplistic to not understand why people from Tallaght might not want to live in Clondalkin or the other side of the M50, these are issues of significant importance to people who grow up locally.

The Deputy is right to bring this up.  We discussed this privately before.  When he was a councillor, two development plans evolved - not the current one but the one before that.  For the first time, we introduced a proactive policy to encourage developments around rightsizing in the private sector.  That has not taken hold at all, and it is difficult to understand why.  Developers are probably more interested in developing at that scale.  We cannot stipulate on planning permissions that a certain proportion of homes should be set aside for rightsizing.  That is not envisaged in current planning policy at least.<\/p> <p>  On the rental-purchase side, it is only a hunch or a reaction to the Deputy's question, but I suggest that renting is quite lucrative in his neighbourhood.  That is why developers are holding on to a portion of developments for long-term rental in quality locations.  Mr. Ward can go through the detail of our scheme, which allows the opportunity for people to downsize and move into local authority-led developments.  There is a formula for that.  We have a rightsizing homes officer whose daily job is to speak to people about that opportunity on both sides, namely, the social housing side and the private housing side.  Mr. Ward can give the statistics as to how that is going.  It is going quite well.  It is a key part of our housing strategy going forward.  As we bring forward developments, hopefully the quality of them will entice more people to engage on that issue.  It is an obvious problem.  As already stated, on our social side we have an 11% rate of under-occupation.

Entering on to it is not great and the Traveller halting site there does not have a good safe entrance onto that road.  It is very dangerous and unsightly.

It is only if the private rental accommodation is being sold and they received a notice to quit that they potentially face homelessness.  I would come back to the value for money question between a family being put into emergency homeless accommodation at a cost of &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 per year versus long-term leasing solutions.  My experience in the city of long-term leasing are brand new, A energy-rated apartments and homes that have been built to the highest standards and are often furnished.  They are on a long-term lease of somewhere between 15 and 25 years, which if we take the cost of &euro;300,000 works out at about &euro;12,000 per year.

We will call in our witnesses in a moment and I will do the housekeeping, etc., when they are all with us.  The witnesses are now welcome to join us.<\/p> <p>  I welcome our witnesses.  The topic before the committee today is the enforcement of court orders relating to child maintenance, access and custody.  This is one of our family law topics.  The committee takes elective modules and matters of interest to members of the committee every so often.  That is the subject of today's hearing.  Our guests might raise their hands as I go through the attendance if their names are not on the title bars in front of them.  I welcome Ms Louise Bayliss, the co-founder of Single Parents Acting for the Rights of our Kids, SPARK; Ms Karen Kiernan from One Family; Ms Stephanie Whyte, assistant director of children's services at Barnardos; Mr. Damien Peelo, chief executive officer of Treoir; Ms Gayle Smith, information and policy office of Treoir; Mr. Mark Garrett, director general of the Law Society of Ireland; and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, senior counsel, director of policy at the Law Society of Ireland.  All our guests are sitting in the order in which they appear on my list, which is a good start.  We are on message and on sequence so far.<\/p> <p>  I will address a small bit of housekeeping before we get into the matters proper.  All our guests are probably familiar with the conduct of hearings here and in similar bodies.  However, I will recap on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they may be directed to discontinue these remarks.  Members will be aware of that.  I call on members and witnesses not to defame anybody outside the room.  That is the simple way of putting it.  I am sure our guests and members are well aware of that but it is important to repeat at the outset.<\/p> <p>  All of the business performed today will be recorded and broadcast live on the Oireachtas channels.  I ask attendees who have mobile phones or other devices to switch them to airplane mode because otherwise they might interfere with the recording and sound system.<\/p> <p>  The way we conduct our business is to take short opening statements from our witnesses to set the scene.  We will come to each of our guests in due course.<\/p><p>They will have three minutes in which to make those opening statements.  It is reasonably short but we set that time because it allows for more time later for the to-and-fro, which we find can be more useful.  We will then have six minutes for each of our members to put their questions to the witnesses.  We will go around the table in the order members indicate and take one member at a time.  There is a six-minute slot for that member to ask questions and for the witnesses to respond.  It is up to individual members whether they want to have six one-minute engagements or a six-minute monologue.  Each member has a mandate so I will not interfere with that.  I will, however, move it on after six minutes to the next member who is coming in.  If needs be, we will then have a second round of three minutes and so on.  Generally, we find that if somebody really wants to respond to an item, it is very likely that it will arise in the following interaction anyway so everybody at the meeting will hopefully have their say across the different interactions.  The order in which the opening statements will be taken is the same order in which I introduced the witnesses.  For convenience, we have a clock in the corner that we use for housekeeping.  The witnesses might keep an eye on that as they are speaking in order that that they can tailor their remarks.

SPARK is a peer-led advocacy and support group for lone parents.  We offer unique insights into the lived reality of parenting alone in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Parenting alone is extremely challenging and while co-parenting with a non-cohabiting second parent is preferable, this is not always possible, especially in cases where abuse has been historically present.  Many parents are able to agree to access, custody and child maintenance without recourse to the courts and in other cases, parents may agree terms through mediation and will then enforce this through a legally binding court order.  The problem, however, is where parents cannot agree on these issues and need to go to court where a judge decides the matters.  The fact that parents are not able to agree to these fundamental issues without recourse to the court system can in itself indicate that there may be ongoing conflict, and non-compliance of court orders is likely.<\/p> <p>  The courts issue orders on the basis of compliance and once the order is issued, to a large extent, it is expected that the matter is complete.  However, many of our members experience post-separation abuse through the non-compliance of court orders involving maintenance and access.  Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, recognises non-payment of child maintenance as financial abuse.  Yet, as we rely on courts that predicate their position on compliance being the norm, many  lone parents will continue to experience ongoing conflict and, in the end, may forfeit maintenance rather than continuing through a court system that for many feels ineffective.<\/p> <p>  In our most recent research from April 2022, 36% of respondents claimed they were owed an average of &euro;8,300 in maintenance arrears but had given up pursuing it and were no longer using the courts to enforce maintenance orders.  Many parents report that a parent will fail to turn up for enforcement hearings and a court can do nothing until a bench warrant is executed.  That is very problematic as there is no prosecuting guard.  Other options such as attachment of earnings can be circumvented by the debtor changing employers.<\/p> <p>  Access is also an issue for many parents.  This can be both where access to the child is denied or where a child is prepared for an access visit and is left waiting when a parent fails to turn up.  For too many parents, access and maintenance are linked.  The biggest loser in this scenario is a child, who may have a damaged relationship with a non-custodial parent.  We believe that maintenance and access should be seen as two separate issues.  This could be achieved by a statutory maintenance agency that deals effectively with finance and which should take the conflict of payments from a family and allow children to have healthy relationships with both parents, if appropriate.  Family law and non-compliance of court orders is a very complex issue to discuss in such a short time but I would be happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":828,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bayliss very much.

It is a constant source of conflict and difficulty for separated families.<\/p> <p>  We know much research has been done into one-parent families and the fact that they are multiply disadvantaged.  Not much research has been done on child maintenance, access or custody, however.  Some work has been done by us in One Family and by SPARK.  Looking at what we have done and at international research from other countries, we can see that a whole suite of common problems exist where the State does not become involved in the management of maintenance.  At a national level, we see child poverty rates going up.  We also see repeated and inappropriate use of courts, which all costs the State money and difficulty.<\/p> <p>  At a personal level, we very much see in our services the conflict this causes within families who are trying to share parenting or separate.  Of course, there is the hardship for the children who are not being appropriately supported by both of their parents.  We are also aware that because of the conflict, there can be links between the payment of maintenance and access or contact for children.  Although these issues should be considered separately, they are sometimes looked at together.  We are aware that there are many difficulties in the administration of maintenance by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, for example, where it can be multiply assessed as means.  Sometimes, even if it is not paid, it is assessed as means.  We note that during the lockdown, the Department changed its policy and started to believe parents who said they had sought maintenance.  We would like to see that continued; it was very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I will mention our recommendations.  We would like the Department of Justice to commission independent research looking internationally.  We have done some work on this.  It is extremely difficult to know, not just from looking at the published papers but also from speaking directly to parents and organisations, how the different systems impact them.  We have not yet found a completely perfect system.  That needs to then be looked at in an Irish context to see what can happen.  We would like the recommendations to train staff in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Courts Service, legal professionals and the Judiciary.  That recommendation was made in the Oireachtas committee report on lone parents as well as in the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, strategy.  We would like child poverty to be recognised, with maintenance as part of that, in the next iteration of the children and young people's framework, that is, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020.  Child maintenance should be treated as a non-taxed, non-means-tested payment as with child benefit.  Really, it needs to come out of the family law courts.  It should not be linked to other issues.  An independent agency should do two things.  It should assess what should be paid and ensure it is paid through enforcement.

Barnardos provides front-line services to children and their families who are affected by traumatic and challenging life situations including poverty, parental mental health difficulties, neglect, bereavement, addiction and parental separation.  We offer a range of early intervention and targeted services in our 45 service locations across the country, in family homes, schools, community centres and in communities themselves.<\/p> <p>  In terms of parental separation, a recent analysis by Barnardos of families accessing our services showed that one third of children who currently access our services are involved in parental separation.  More and more families being referred to our services to help children and their parents deal with issues relating to parental separation.  These are the situations that get referred to us for entrenched conflict.  Sometimes, the relationships have become very difficult and sometimes toxic.  As a result, one or both of the parents cannot deal with the separation in an amicable way that is most beneficial to any children involved.  The court experience for families in which parents are separating can be very complex and confusing for all the parties, particularly for the children.  The whole process of going to court - the language used, the timing, the formality of seeing solicitors and judges - can be very unclear to the eyes of children.  The lack of certainty and clarity about timelines and potential outcomes can make things appear very complex.  One of the most complex elements of the court system around court orders and decisions needs to be about ensuring the best interests of the child.  Unfortunately, orders can be particularly ineffective if they get the balance wrong between balancing the rights of the parents and the best interests of the children.<\/p> <p>  Children understand that they are not the sole determining factor in court cases regarding access and custody.  Sufficient mechanisms must be in place to ensure their voices and views are gathered, however, and that adequate attention and consideration is given in terms of the decisions but also the pace of implementation and supports to implement those decisions.<\/p><p> There is a lack of professional support for parents and children after separation and family transition, particularly in terms of accessing custody.  More resources should be directed towards earlier supports for parents and children to deal with separation, raise awareness of the potential impact of acrimony on children and ensure strategies for parents to ensure a positive focus on children.  This might reduce the number of families who use the courts as a way of managing family conflict.<\/p><p> Many of the families and children we support who are living in separated households rely on maintenance payments to meet essential costs.  If maintenance goes unpaid, it can drastically affect their budgets and jeopardise their ability to afford essentials.  Many parents we work with cannot and do not seek maintenance from their previous partners, typically as a result of difficulties in those relationships, wider acrimony between both families and sometimes in the community, a history of previous partners not paying and a belief that maintenance will not be paid.  Sometimes it could be a threat to their own recovery and sobriety.  Therefore, we think the system is not working for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Stephanie Whyte","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":833,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates from Barnardos.

Our national information service deals with thousands of queries each year from parents, many of which queries are about maintenance.  Treoir provides legal information to those parents and their extended families and professionals through its services and by way of nationwide outreach.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the examination of the maintenance-recovery procedures.  We make our submission to this committee in the context of the ongoing work on the reform of the family court system.  Each year, Treoir receives thousands of queries about child maintenance  from mothers, fathers and extended family members, and our submission is based on their experiences.  A majority of calls relate to the interaction of maintenance payments with the one-parent family payment and other benefits and highlight the interaction between social protection, maintenance and lone parents experiencing poverty.<\/p> <p>  Under current social welfare policy, the onus is on the custodial parent to pursue maintenance on behalf of the child.  Where an agreement of maintenance between both parents cannot be reached, payment of child maintenance must be sought through the courts.  This can be a daunting and even traumatic experience, especially when there is a history of harassment or domestic violence.  Pursuing maintenance through the courts is time-consuming and expensive.  One caller to our information line described a 20-year battle in the courts to secure maintenance and arrears from an ex-partner as financial abuse.<\/p> <p>  Even when a court order is granted, it is not a guarantee that maintenance will be paid.  However, once that court order for maintenance is made, the amount is counted as means regardless of whether the maintenance is paid.  Consequently, non-payment of maintenance can result in families living on an income lower than their social welfare entitlement.  Lone-parent families already experience higher rates of deprivation than two-parent households, so the insecurity of income through the non-payment of child maintenance leaves them particularly vulnerable to poverty and deprivation.  In the context of the persistence of child poverty in lone-parent families, Treoir believes certainty in the recovery of child maintenance through a statutory agency will go some way towards alleviating child poverty by providing the income security that lone-parent families need.<\/p> <p>  Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child lays out that the state is required to take appropriate measures to secure the recovery of maintenance for the child from parents or other persons having financial responsibility for the child, both within the state party and from abroad.<\/p> <p>  Parenting alone brings many challenges.  Obtaining court orders for maintenance from the non-custodial parent should not be one of them.  There needs to be a standardised, fair system of assessment and recovery of child maintenance.  Treoir feels the establishment of a State maintenance agency would have a key role in that assessment and recovery maintenance.  An immediate benefit would be a reduction in time-consuming and often futile child maintenance cases currently in the court system.  Most crucially, the often-arduous task of pursuing child maintenance can be taken out of the hands of the custodial parent, resulting in a higher rate of enforcement of child maintenance being paid in Ireland and, potentially, greater engagement by both parents in their children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Peelo.

He is also a member of the Law Society&rsquo;s family and child law committee and is very much aware of the current issues and concerns in this area.<\/p> <p>  The Law Society&rsquo;s submission to the joint committee made the following five recommendations in response to questions raised - increase the use of the award-of-costs provision to alleviate the financial burden on lone parents when seeking payment of maintenance owed, and act as a penalty for the respondent party; maximise the reliefs available under the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015 where there have been consistent breaches of access orders; introduce guidelines to assist in determining appropriate maintenance contributions; establish set penalties for breaching court orders relating to child maintenance, access and custody; and, perhaps most significant, support the establishment of a State child maintenance agency to assist in matters relating to child maintenance. <\/p> <p>  We have provided detail of how those recommendations were arrived at.  We will be very glad to discuss this further today if helpful.  We also provided the committee with our 2021 submission to the Child Maintenance Review Group.  This highlighted the importance of maintenance for the support and well-being of the child from both financial and social policy perspectives.  We also welcomed the proposed establishment of a State maintenance agency, similar to the UK&rsquo;s Child Maintenance Service, and detailed the various services and supports that might be provided through such a vehicle.  These include providing guidance on the calculation of appropriate levels of maintenance; assisting parents in reaching agreed maintenance arrangements; assisting in &ndash; or, where appropriate, bringing &ndash; court applications to determine maintenance when it is in dispute; acting as the collecting agent for maintenance payments in appropriate cases; and engaging in the enforcement of maintenance and the collection of arrears, either directly or in concert with other State agencies. <\/p> <p>  We believe the cumulative effect of centralising these supports through one agency would be to minimise acrimony between the parties, to the ultimate benefit of the child or children involved. <\/p> <p>  The submission also compared enforcement provisions across various jurisdictions that may assist the committee in its work.<\/p> <p>  We believe these measures, together with progress on the family court Bill, which we appreciate has been listed as priority legislation for publication this autumn session, have the potential to greatly improve users&rsquo; current experience of the family law infrastructure in the State.

I wholeheartedly agree with them that the system we have does not work.  In some scenarios, it can adversely affect relationships with non-custodial parents if they are not paying maintenance.

It puts the parent who has ultimate responsibility in a very precarious position.<\/p> <p>  I have a question to which all of the delegates may respond.  The court system can take months or years to go through and can involve an endless, futile journey for parents.  Are there models abroad with timeframes that work?  Can we talk about the solution these would provide by comparison with our system, which imposes a huge financial burden on parents pursuing a challenge?

There are a number of comparative models.  I am suggesting to the committee, on behalf of the society, that the best way of approaching this is to embed a child maintenance agency within the existing structure in order that there be no legal vulnerabilities.  We could have a child maintenance agency established under statute and with orders ultimately appealable to the District Court, which would mean a lot of routine applications could be dealt with by the agency.<\/p> <p>  In our submission, we looked at a number of models.  There are two models to consider currently if a child maintenance agency is to be established, namely, the models from the UK and the Netherlands, both of which have such an agency in place.  In terms of speed, we know from the experience in other jurisdictions that a child maintenance agency is very effective in dealing with applications on a consensual basis.  The real problem is with enforcement.  That is where we could look at investing in agency powers that do not trespass on the powers of the court.  There is a delicate balance to be found to ensure there is no trespassing on what ultimately are the powers of the court.  There has been some recent Supreme Court jurisprudence on what is and is not possible.  It is the view of the Law Society of Ireland that a child maintenance agency will improve the efficiencies within the system and result in more timely decisions.<\/p> <p>  However, there are other issues that perhaps need to be addressed and the question of what role a child maintenance agency would play in that regard.  We must remember that maintenance is a private law obligation.   In regard to State supports, there is a need to ensure the agency works very closely with the Department of Social Protection.  It is about establishing those relationships, establishing the powers of the agency and making sure those powers work alongside the powers available to the courts, with the majority of the decisions being taken by the agency, subject to an appeal to the District Court, which is ultimately where most of these decisions are taken.  I hope that is helpful to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":840,"content":"<p>Under the Scandinavian model, the state pays the child and parent upfront and recoups the payment from the liable relative.  That is the gold standard because it ensures the child is not living in poverty and the parent who needs the money gets it.  There are other systems.  Senator Ruane has done a lot of work on a Bill to deal with child maintenance, including looking at the Inland Revenue model in New Zealand.  One of the reasons we recommended research is that things can look good but one must speak to the end user to find out the reality.  We know from speaking to people in Scotland and elsewhere in Britain that there are significant difficulties with their systems and parents in Britain have to pay to use them.  Where the parent of a child is not paying for that child, the other parent has to pay to use the system to recoup payment.  It is very difficult to get a perfect system and it requires a little research to get it right.  Ultimately, as Dr. Shannon said, it is about taking matters as much as possible out of court and away from conflict.  The focus should be on doing it for the child.

Even when there is entrenched conflict, parents should be helped to understand the impact on their children and to ensure the children are separated from the conflict going on between their parents.  Sometimes, there is a context of very aggressive behaviour by one of the partners involved even below the threshold of domestic abuse.  Entrenched conflict can be very difficult and we know children feel a sense of responsibility for conflict between their parents.  They feel it is their fault that mom and dad cannot agree, mom has to chase dad for money and dad does not pay mom.  They blame themselves.  We must have a situation in which there are supports around whatever model is used that allow people to manage their relationships and put the children at the centre.

I have always been of the mind that the courts are not the place for dealing with child maintenance.  It seems there is consensus on that.  It is not the right environment to determine child maintenance arrangements.  As we know, payments can be ordered by the judge of the day, who can choose a figure off the top of his or her head.  There are no guidelines set out.  Moreover, whatever figure the judge chooses is not necessarily paid.  Every time, it is up to the lone parent to go back to court, a bench warrant is issued and, often, there is no prosecuting garda in attendance.<\/p> <p>  At every point, the burden comes back on lone parents.  We really need to take it off their shoulders.  I firmly believe a child maintenance service can only be beneficial for lone-parent families and the children of those families.  The children need to be central in the process but they are not central at the moment, which is part of the problem.  As other speakers have noted, there is a real need in this to deal with poverty and lift children out of poverty.  There is evidence to show that when maintenance is paid, it plays a role in doing that.<\/p> <p>  We are waiting for the report of the child maintenance review group.  That group was established in 2020 and it is welcome.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, received its report at Easter time and she confirmed to me two weeks ago that she will bring it to the Government before the end of the year.  It is highly likely, therefore, that we will not see it until next year, which would be really disappointing.  I urge the committee to seek the publication of the report as soon as possible.  I have no doubt good work has been done in producing it and it would be great for the stakeholders to see it.  Let us have the engagement on it and move forward from there.<\/p> <p>  Whatever the outcome of the report, which I hope is to recommend that a child maintenance service be established, it will not happen overnight.  Will the witnesses indicate what can be done now that will make a difference?  One such action would be removing the inclusion of maintenance payments as household means for the purpose of assessing eligibility for social welfare payments and housing.  Ms Bayliss has raised the issue of housing a number of times.  Will she comment on the impact of child maintenance payments on rent assessments in particular?  Action on that issue could be taken straight away.  Such payments should not be seen as means but as income to assist in raising a child or children.  That is what they are for and how they should be treated.  In addition, we should remove the condition whereby parents must prove they have sought maintenance before being able to get the one-parent family or jobseeker's transitional payment.  Again, that should not be the case.  These are two measures that could be taken immediately and would make a difference.  Is there anything else that can be done?<\/p> <p>  Looking at existing models is important.  On three occasions, we have brought forward proposals based on the model that is in place in the North.  It is not perfect but I am not sure we will find a perfect model.  The job of work has to be to find an existing model, take the lessons from it and then build the best model we can.<\/p> <p>  There is a need for reform within the Department of Social Protection and its liable relatives unit.  That unit really is only there to recoup the State's costs arising from the one-parent family payment.  That is slightly disturbing because it is not what it should be about.  It should always be about the child and recouping costs to assist in rearing that child.<\/p> <p>  Whatever service is established, which I hope will be done, enforcement is absolutely key.<\/p><p>We need strong links to Revenue.  Where payment is not made, it needs to be able to be taken from welfare payments, wages or wherever other means necessary.  There is no point in having a service if we do not have adequate enforcement to ensure payment is made.  The problem at the moment is that in many cases it is not actually made.<\/p><p> In previous years we have not been able to get a figure for the cost of establishing a child maintenance service.  I gather because of the work done by the review group, a figure is now there.  We were given a figure for our alternative budget this year of &euro;2.3 million.  That is the initial establishment cost.  Obviously, after that, not everybody will need to use the service, so I do not see the cost being anywhere near as high in future.  Could anything else be done immediately while we wait for this child maintenance review group report and hopefully the establishment which, unfortunately, will take time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#D00600","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":846,"content":"<p>Enforcement is key and that is what is lacking.  The courts operate on the basis that there is compliance and if there is not, it is up to the lone parent to pursue it.  There should be options which are not there at the moment.  For instance, for the attachment of earnings it is necessary to know who the employer is.  A way to circumvent that is to change jobs and then the lone parent is back at the end of it.  We know their PPS numbers.  Why can it not be an attachment to a PPS number instead of an attachment of earnings?  It would mean that wherever they go whether they are self-employed or whether they are changing jobs, the lone parent does not need to find out who the employer is or where have they gone if they change.  Even having to know the address for the summons is a real barrier.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that the Deputy has mentioned housing, which is a major issue for many lone parents, especially in the case of domestic abuse.  Lone parents may get a court order requiring the mortgage or the rent to be paid, which is a very progressive thing.  However, unfortunately the Department of Social protection will not see that as the mortgage payment; it sees it as a cash payment into the hands of people.  There is hypocrisy that the State would support a lone parent through rent supplement to leave the family home but will then assess the mortgage payment and bar her from taking social welfare payments to maintain herself and her children.<\/p> <p>  A housing disregard was introduced in 1997 to help parents in that situation.  That was introduced at &pound;75 in 1997.  That payment is now &euro;95.23.  It is not reflective of the current housing market and is driving lone parents in domestic abuse situations from the family home and into a private rental market which costs the State more money.  Somebody might be entitled to a HAP of &euro;2,000 and yet where there is a court order ordering the mortgage of &euro;600 or &euro;700 to be paid, the Department is coming in and assessing it.  That is something that could be done overnight and would make an enormous difference to lone parents struggling at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":847,"content":"<p>The review group is looking at what the Department of Social Protection can actually do.

That needs to be resolved.  It should become a non-means tested payment.  It should be included.  We are waiting on the family justice strategy and the family law courts Bill to be published.  We need to see this as supporting that work.  I am aware of judges going into courts with calculators.  Somebody could work on an assessment framework for what is appropriate to meet the child's need.  As Ms Whyte said, family supports help people make decisions outside the court system, which is cheaper and quicker.  Those things can be resourced.  We have specialist services in this area.  These things can easily be done very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  The discussion has already moved on to what needs to be in place instead of just looking to enforce the orders.  I have spent probably about four years drafting legislation because it is such a difficult area.  A good chunk of that time was spent building the assessment calculation tool and, obviously, maths is not my forte.  It took us a long time to build what goes into that.  What if maintenance is paid to other families?  There are many inputs in terms of the liable parent and the assessment of percentage of their income, outgoings, other liable children and stuff like that.<\/p> <p>  It is based on the New Zealand model with additions.  The Women's Caucus has agreed to take that on as its first piece of legislative work as a cross-party group which I hope will give it strength.  It is just getting it to the final stages.  We have it built into the Revenue and the Revenue already has all the powers the system may need, including powers to deduct.  We have also looked at elements of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, model.  The bits we are finishing now relate to GDPR and using people's data if they refuse to engage.  How does it stand with GDPR in terms of default assessments and using someone's data?  Obviously, Revenue has all the information we need from PPS numbers to income.<\/p> <p>  We have looked at people's assets.  It has been a thorough piece of work which has taken a long time.  I hope it gets support.  I am also conscious of wanting to have guaranteed payment which the New Zealand model does not give.  I have drafted the legislation so that it is a building block and is open to add on subsequent sections.  If we eventually get to the stage where the State is willing to do guaranteed payment and then recoup, this legislation is built in a way that it can be added into the system even if it is not there initially.  If this legislation goes forward, I am concerned that it still might not be enough.  When we drive something, we always wonder what will happen if it does not achieve what we need it to achieve.<\/p> <p>  If we follow that New Zealand model within the Revenue it will not be a stand-alone agency, but I do not think it needs to be.  We could be waiting another ten or 20 years if we keep going after the standalone agency piece.  However, it would then be open to add that building block in terms of guaranteed payment later.  It encompasses all extra costs, including disability.  It is quite complex hence it has taken me so long to get there but it is nearly done.  I would like the witnesses to outline any concerns they might have about the model I am pursuing and any concerns that it will not achieve what we are discussing today under that model with the Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#E00400","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":849,"content":"<p>It was really interesting to work with the Senator on that and to learn a bit more about it.

Incremental reform, I have always argued, is the best type of reform because reform has to be culturally appropriate.  We should not lose sight of that.  There are probably four models that could be followed.  Maintenance is guaranteed by the state in, for example, Australia, Sweden, Estonia, Italy, Germany and Hungary.  It is guaranteed by specific bodies indirectly governed by the state in France, Slovakia and Belgium.  It is governed by local authorities in the Czech Republic, Denmark and Finland.  It is guaranteed by special funds in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal.  It is guaranteed by special agencies in the UK and the Netherlands.  Whatever approach we take, we should not lose sight of the fact that children within the Irish system are generally invisible.  We are just ten years short of having passed the children's rights referendum.  It is a real tragedy that we treat children as what I would call bystanders, whereas they are deeply affected by the parents' inability to pay maintenance.  We need, therefore, to redouble our efforts to ensure there is a minimum.

Otherwise, the order states, \"You can pay the parent and we will take half of it.\"  Why on earth do we give parents the option to penalise their children?  Why are we giving parents that patriarchal approach that a man or a woman - whoever the liable relative is - can decide?  Why are we giving them the option to decide they do not want their children to see the benefit?  The parents themselves are not benefiting from that - they still have to pay the determination order - but we are letting them say to the Department, \"You can take all the money and make sure my child does not see it.\"  That is repugnant and it says something about how we treat children.

One is the new iteration, as I mentioned, of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures that is being worked on.  I have sat on the advisory council for that for the past six or seven years and the council has been very clear that our main focus is child poverty and that we would like a national child poverty action plan to be developed that is cross-departmental.  There are other countries, such as New Zealand and Scotland, that do that very well and have it based in legislation.  Every Department centres the needs of children so this does not become a value judgment about the parents.  Research tells us that people make judgments about different kinds of parents for different reasons.  We need to circumvent that at a State level.<\/p> <p>  There is another opportunity.  Cosc defines the non-payment of child maintenance as financial abuse, but that is not reflected anywhere in legislation, services from the Department of Social Protection or anywhere else.

I accept what has been said about the philosophical point, which I had not really thought about until it was phrased in that way.  It is interesting because we talk about child poverty but we fail sometimes to connect the language of failing to pay maintenance.  I think more people would connect with that language if it were more broadly situated.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon and Ms Bayliss might respond to the following.  Let us say a parent wants to pay maintenance and is reliably paid.  That is not the baseline.  We have a public model which is the baseline, and maintenance can be paid on top of that.<\/p><p>However, our concern is situations where it is not paid and how we can attach that.  What was said about the PPS number is very important.  It is important that the liable parent, as it were, pays and it is not just the State.  It should not become an acceptable State idea that people can leave their child &ndash; or whatever scenario has happened before &ndash; and have no financial obligation to care for their child in some way.  I do not want to decouple it so much that maintenance ceases to be relevant to it.  There are many different ways of considering that, whether that is paid from a court order that is simply then paid to or attached to Revenue and feeds into the Exchequer fund generally and goes to support a different model.<\/p><p> I am interested in what Dr. Shannon said about how far an agency can go.  I do not know if he elaborated on that following the Supreme Court and how far an agency can go beyond a court being involved.  The biggest difficulty seems to be with access to court and actual enforcement of the different models.  We have talked much about maintenance, but enforcement of access is an issue I see again and again in different ways.  With an access issue, one should not have to go back to court each time.  It makes the issue much bigger than it needs to be when one is trying to have a harmonious life for a child.

The best way to deal with this is alternative dispute resolution.  The Government should try to have an elaborate system for engaging with parents at an early stage and create that in a more sophisticated manner than currently exists.  There is huge potential in that.  If we look at some of the other international models where that has occurred, it has occurred with a degree of success.  That is the real potential.  However, let us not pretend that there is a magic bullet; there is no magic bullet here.  The Government needs to look at the powers it can grant to the agency and support the agency in terms of resources but also in terms of alternative dispute resolution and try to get as much agreement as it possibly can.

Over the years I can think of several scenarios where we have had some success with fathers &ndash; forgive me for saying fathers &ndash; when we have framed things in a different way, that is, separating and unhooking it from the other partner.  What I mean is that when one says non-payment of maintenance or other issues, certainly framing them as financial abuse, but also framing them as a parenting choice and facilitating them in a process of seeing their actions in the context of their father-child or parent-child relationship.  While obviously it is not a magic bullet, as Dr. Shannon said, sometimes creating spaces for that reflection and having services that focus on that kind of therapeutic end and point out the impact on the child works.<\/p> <p>  Let us focus back on the child and not the ex-partner and what she did or did not do.  Let us focus on the parent&rsquo;s current choices and actions and frame them as a parenting choice.  We have seen some movement.

The goal is for that relationship to be meaningful and for parents to see their actions as parenting choices.  What can we do now?  We can invest more in services that do that kind of work and create opportunities for those kinds of discussions to happen so as to exhaust the opportunities for therapeutic improvement in how people understand their actions.

Short of that, there is no quick-fix solution.  The child maintenance agency is a step forward.  I will completely connect with a point articulated by Senator Ruane that maintenance is in the here and now, particularly for lone parents.  The Law Society can elaborate on how that might be achieved.  We could provide a supplemental submission on this idea of creating a fund.  We need to be creative in our thinking.  That point around what happens to those who are at the margins resonated with me.<\/p> <p>  The cases we are talking about this afternoon are those parents &ndash; and children affected by the decisions of parents &ndash; who access our District Court, which is a very local court, on a daily basis.  How do we help them out?  The child maintenance agency would be a game-changer, but it needs to supplemented by other systems, as the point raised by Deputy Carroll MacNeill.<\/p><p>The other systems would be that idea of the maintenance fund and then additional sanctions.  What we need to do is provide for all contingencies, and the additional sanctions would be sanctions that do not involve criminalising a parent.  Sending a parent to prison is counterproductive.  It is about how we provide more effective provisions.<\/p><p> I will finish with a case in point.  We have not talked a lot of about access and the breach of access orders, which is a very serious problem.  In the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, there were new and innovative sanctions for dealing with those who refused to facilitate access.  Anecdotally, it would appear that those sanctions are not being utilised so we need to use the legislation that we have currently in place.  The society is currently undertaking research across all of the District Court areas to look at how that Act is operating, and we are quite happy to feed that research into the committee.  What we are hearing anecdotally is that the provisions that were created to ensure access is not breached are not being used to the maximum, and that needs to happen.

The provision that has historically been used is the consent provision but there are other sanctions available, such as a cost sanction or requiring parents to go on parenting courses.  Again, on the point made earlier, it is about bringing home the reality of refusing to facilitate access, which can be quite powerful.

This is a significant topic.  There are people who do not take up access and there are parents who do not facilitate it.  We are aware, through our services and through working with mums and dads and separated families, that there are often high levels of fear and concern about the child.  This is exacerbated through conflicts in the family courts and the inability of courts to have accurate information in the form of assessments in a timely, affordable or accessible way.  That is a whole other issue.<\/p> <p>  It is very complicated.  We know there is a huge gap in practice and understanding of where child protection systems interact with private family law cases and criminal cases, and there can be all three going on in one family and affecting a child, and there is no satisfactory system or any system to bring those together.  That is a major issue that we are hoping will be addressed in the family justice strategy, or at least pointed to in that strategy.  The courts do not have all of the information they need because people are either representing themselves or they might be privately represented, and there can be inherent power imbalances, with people walking in while in coercive control situations.  There are many reasons why access may not or should not happen.  We also know of children being into unsafe or inappropriate contact by means of court orders because, for whatever reason, the courts may not have all of the information available to them.  There are massive problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I would like to add a few thoughts about access and sanctions.  I do not think sanctions are working.  There needs to be better enforcement than having to go in and out of court.  I say that as somebody who has been in and out of court, and it is draining, destroying and really upsetting emotionally.  The idea of attaching it to a PPS number and going through Revenue is a simple solution.  If we look at the property tax, for instance, Revenue has the right to go directly to your employers, they have your PPS number and they will take whatever is owed.  If we can do that for a property tax, why can we not do it with child benefit or for the rights of a child?  Children have more need than property does.  That is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  With regard to access, no woman wants to deprive her child of access in a safe environment, although that is not to say it does not happen; it does.  From years of talking to women in SPARK who are going through this, if someone is in a powerless situation and they feel powerless going in and out of the courts, their only weapon - it should not be a weapon but that is what happens in an adversarial court system - is to withdraw access if he has not paid maintenance.  It is unfair and it is wrong on the children, but it does happen.  If we guarantee the payment to a child through Revenue, then we take all of that out and there is no reason for a woman to deny access.<\/p> <p>  All of the international research has shown that when a parent pays maintenance, they will keep in contact with the child.  Again, the Deputy said she does not think it should be totally decoupled.  The proof is that when they pay maintenance, they will see the child.  I am not advocating one way or the other for a statutory maintenance agency or for Revenue, but something needs to happen urgently because children are suffering in the meantime, and they are suffering because of access issues and poverty.

This November, we are ten years on from the children's rights referendum where we talked about hearing children.  The people most affected by the refusal to facilitate access are actually children.  It is absolutely important that we ensure children are heard in these decisions because they are the people who ultimately will be affected.<\/p> <p>  There are problems within the system at the moment with regard to ensuring that happens.  We need the resourcing of reports if children are to be heard indirectly, but they are not adequately resourced.  The second point is that we still have not succeeded in that project of hearing children in all cases.  With regard to a new family court - we were just talking about this outside - two generations of children have grown up since we first started talking about this issue, yet children are not properly heard in these cases.

Again, it goes back to resources.  Definitely, a child's voice needs to be heard and their reasoning needs to be heard.<\/p> <p>  What we are interested in is not just that this is provided for by expertise, which is needed in these complex cases, but also that parents are given tacit support to be able to recognise what is in the best interests of the child.  We would have heard that from both parents in an adversarial role, with both thinking they are doing the same thing although it is complete opposite, and both claiming it is in the best interests of the child.

Children repeatedly tell us that for the most part they want to have a meaningful relationship with both parents.  Where it gets complicated is when there is not a sufficient support system around that to delve into the complexity of relationships.  These are very complex, hurtful scenarios that children are dealing with all the time and there seems to be no scope to cope with that nuance and complexity.  It is not static; it is dynamic.  Children's feelings change and evolve, depending on the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Children tell us over and over again, particularly if they have observed bad behaviour by one of their parents, that when they have been bold they get into trouble, of if they have done something bad they have to acknowledge it, say that they did it and say they are sorry.  When it comes to access, children sometimes say they would not mind having a relationship with their parent but it is contingent on that parent saying to the child that the parent is sorry that something happened, that the child did not imagine it, the parent did it, should not have done it and is sorry.  They can then move forward in their relationship.  There is, however, no support structure for those kind of conversations to be facilitated and teased out in a safe way that allows children to say these kinds of things to whichever parent it is and also for the parent to hear it, to be supported to hear it and genuinely allowed to be facilitated on a therapeutic journey, if he or she is willing and able to engage in that.<\/p> <p>  It is very complex.

Currently, we have voice-of-the-child reports that are done by child view experts for which there is a level of regulation and control.  There are difficulties with that.  There is no regulation whatsoever of section 47 child welfare reports.  There is nowhere for parents to go.  We have had parents report to us very serious concerns about their assessors and there is nothing they can do.  There is no professional body they can go to.  There is an interesting case in the UK at present on this and the qualifications of someone doing these reports.  There is a significant requirement on the State to regulate, at a minimum, people who can do them but ultimately, to pick up on what we said and what Barnardos staff are saying, a lot can be done outside of court for a much lower cost.  That is what we do, day in, day out, in One Family.  We can have people come to realisations and agreements and they do not have to go down the court route, or they get ratified in court.<\/p> <p>  Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork, UCC, are doing research for us at present on access for infants in separated families.  They are saying that their voices need to be heard.  We are not hearing the voices of children who are much older than that.  There is no system.  If someone cannot afford to pay, it is not happening.  We are not vindicating children's rights under the Constitution at present and that is very problematic.  Ultimately, each family and each child are different.  We need somebody skilled who is able to look at that situation and listen to everybody.  Children cannot hold the responsibility of picking whether they get to see a parent or not.  They can be consulted but they cannot make that decision unless they are much older.  There has to be a system around to do that.  We proposed a model in our submission to the family justice oversight group around a family law services model, which would complement what will be done in the courts.  It will not be as successful as it should be unless these things are done.<\/p> <p>  Assessments and the quality and timeliness of information that goes into court are key.  I definitely sense a reluctance on the part of the State to regulate, fund or support any kind of reporting on families.  Yet, that is what is ultimately needed for the success and closure of cases, which means happier families and less trauma.  Our systems are causing adverse childhood experiences.  The separation may not do so but the trauma and process families have to go through are causing adverse childhood experiences, which people like us and Tusla need to look at and count to see how traumatised a child is.  The State is complicit in creating these situations, unfortunately.  There is so much that can be done.  If child maintenance could be removed from the family law arena, there would be more resources to do that bit of it properly.  Only what has to go to court should do so.  Some 80% or 90% of this should be done outside of court.  That is across all family law issues, not just maintenance but access, custody, guardianship, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":905,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a very important point.

She feels absolutely powerless because her husband is a member of the settled community.  Are there any measures in place &ndash; special measures, if you want &ndash; for people from ethnic minorities, especially when it comes to Travellers in the court system?  We have systems in place but even I, as a Senator, would not know the run of them.

There is an awful lot of fear over access, especially among women in my community and Roma women.  It is important that we have these conversations.  Although Senator Ruane was talking about vulnerable groups, what happens does not happen among them alone; it can happen to millionaires.  Again, it is a matter of the child.  Have the delegates any answers on the provision of support to people from the Traveller community?  Cultural barriers can also shape a child.  Separation does not happen in our community.  Even if the mother of a child were abusive, the child would have to stay with her.  In some cases, but not all cases, it would not be regarded as the man's role to look after the child.

In the five years in which I have been with Treoir, I encountered three unfortunate cases in which members of the Traveller community were prevented from seeing their children after the breaking up of a relationship with a person from the majority population.  In these cases, the courts upheld that the Travellers' way of living was such that it was not appropriate for a child to visit them.  That is not based on evidence, and it is not even based on a section 47 report; it is based on somebody's perception of what it is to be a Traveller and what living in a halting site or Traveller-specific scheme would entail.  This has caused hurt.  We can talk about access laws, maintenance and other issues but at the root of what I have described is institutionalised discrimination and racism.  Therefore, alongside all the work we are talking about, we require anti-racism work and training for the Judiciary, workers and all of us in the field so we will gain a deeper understanding of the impact on minority groups.

With regard to diversity and the need for the courts to be responsive, do many of these issues arise owing to slow progression through the court system?  A matter may be listed but not taken or adjourned because of the prospect of talks or progress.  Developments are always on the never-never or always in the ether but never seem to happen very often.  Progress can take months, if not years, and all the while those concerned are on the receiving end waiting for an order or award to be made while trying to make ends meet.

We have not discussed the fact that the non-enforcement of court orders facilitates post-separation abuse.  In a case of domestic abuse, the only area remaining where someone can exercise coercive control is around access and maintenance.  That is used post separation.  The courts are really at the mercy of people's behaviour because they assume compliance and if there is none, it is up to the other person to repeatedly go back to the court.  What the Chairman said about adjournment is true to a point.  It is even more dangerous than that, in one sense.  As was mentioned earlier, if a person does not turn up for a court appointment, which often happens, the judge will sometimes lose patience, allow no more adjournments and issue a bench warrant.  There is no prosecuting garda in family law cases.  The bench warrant goes out to the local Garda station and sits in a tray waiting to be executed and because there is no prosecuting garda, it is unlikely to be executed unless a parent can go directly to a superintendent and get it enforced.  All proceedings are halted.  The court's arms are tied until that bench warrant is executed.  That is an horrendous and ongoing situation.  Our research revealed that 36% of parents are owed a significant amount of arrears and have stopped seeking it either voluntarily, because of the ongoing and draining nature of the process to which the Chairman referred, or because a bench warrant is sitting in a Garda station waiting to be executed.

It is reinforcing the point to which Ms Kiernan referred.

The issue is that the partner of that person knew how to play and utilise the system.  The many others who do not know how to do that are caught in the position to which Ms Bayliss referred whereby people do not turn up and bench warrants issue.  Where the ultimate sanction is one of imprisonment, it is often the case that a mother will not choose that and will ask for it not to be enforced.  Parents sometimes do not agree on an amount of maintenance and that is why we are saying an agency to deal with those issues is required.  That way, those parents should not have to go to court because there is a statutory obligation to pay maintenance that we know is there.  It should include a fixed minimum fee.  There may be issues around one's personal public service, PPS, number and Revenue involvement.  However, whatever way the agency may use that information, it is important that maintenance is immediately deducted so there are no long-term delays and people do not have to go through a court process.  The person still maintains a right to bring matters to a court and have them judicially reviewed and appealed but that should not come at the cost of not paying the maintenance.  The maintenance should start at the beginning of that process rather than leaving people waiting.  We need to set a minimum statutory amount for situations in which parents do not agree and for that to be immediately enforced.  That would help people immediately and protect families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#L01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":936,"content":"<p>That is true.

There are three aspects to this matter.  The court buildings are only one third of the issue.  The infrastructure is a key consideration.  Creating a new set of buildings is not going to deliver reform.  The support systems that are in place will deliver reform.  I would prefer we did not establish a family court system unless it is properly supported.  The success of the family court system will be dependent on the support systems that are put in place.  Those systems include counselling and mediation services, those wraparound services.  The third, and equally important, point is to explain why we are having these delays.  We need fundamental procedural reform to address how cases are dealt with.  There needs to be a root-and-branch review of the procedural issues at both District Court and Circuit Court levels.<\/p><p>I have a huge amount of sympathy for District Court judges who are dealing with a large number of cases.  It must be remembered that in a child and care context, the most important decision one will ever take in a case is to decide whether to take a child into care.  Yet, that is dealt with at a District Court level.  That is all very well but we need to make sure that the supports are in place.

Ar bhealach t&aacute; s&eacute; thar am go nd&eacute;anfaimid a leith&eacute;id.<\/p> <p>  The members all know how important this Bill is in a range of ways.  It is important to our economy in promising to deliver on a modern regulatory system for a crucial business sector.  It is important for our society in providing safety and security for people as they seek to benefit from the considerable opportunities provided by the Internet.  It is most important, however, for our children.  We can all acknowledge how important it is to be able to protect our children from online harm and empower them to deal with the challenges of an online society.  I propose a range of amendments in three categories.  The first is on foot of issues raised in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and on which I committed to act.  The second is amendments to provide for the individual complaints mechanism and the third is amendments required for technical reasons.  The Government approved the amendments on 18 October.<\/p> <p>  The expert group report on the individual complaints mechanism was published on 20 September.  The group ultimately concluded that the complaints mechanism was feasible and, on foot of that, the appropriate amendments have been drafted.  The amendments ensure that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n has a legal basis to begin phasing in a robust individual complaints mechanism in the coming years which will initially focus on children and a number of non-offence-specific categories of harmful online content such as cyberbullying.<\/p> <p>  Another amendment is designed to provide for the inclusion of further forms of offence-specific harmful online content under Schedule 3 of the Bill.  This further content relates to the criminal offence of flashing under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  The amendments will allow the online safety commissioner to appropriately deal with online content related to the offence of flashing through systemic regulations.  Other important changes are amendments to ensure the inclusion of local broadcasters in the scheme to support professional journalistic practices and to provide clarity on when coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may dismiss certain complaints.<\/p> <p>  I know that members of the committee have proposed a range of amendments on a range of issues and I look forward to the debate.  I intend to bring a number of amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  The first group of amendments will be to section 53, specifically those provisions that relate to the content production scheme.  I am conscious that Deputies have proposed their own Committee Stage amendments to section 53, some of which relate to matters that I have been considering for some time.  I look forward to discussing them in detail with Deputies and indicating how I will seek to address those issues on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I intend to bring an amendment to provide that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services and promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services.<\/p> <p>  I intend to bring a number of technical amendments to remove references to the obligation of RT&Eacute; and TG4 to maintain the teletext service.  There is a sense of urgency to this debate, not least in the form of infringement proceedings pending at EU level, because we are very motivated to formally establish coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and empower and resource it to start its important work.

When I established the expert group earlier this year I made it clear that if it was feasible to introduce an individual complaints mechanism, I would provide for it in the Bill.  That is what I am proposing to do with these amendments.  The expert group has done its work and has given detailed consideration to the wide range of issues raised in the context of an individual complaints mechanism, including through a public consultation and engagement with experts such as the Australian e-safety commissioner.  The expert group&rsquo;s report and recommendations chart a practical way forward for the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism, focused on operationalising the mechanism on a phased basis and firstly for children.  These amendments were drafted on the basis of the heads contained in the expert group&rsquo;s report and they hew closely to the expert group&rsquo;s recommendations, save for necessary legal adjustments by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p><p>In this regard, amendment No. 118 provides for the substantive provisions for the phasing in and operation of an individual complaints mechanism, including how an coimisi&uacute;n can make schemes for complaints about various kinds of harmful online content; the threshold that must be met before an coimisi&uacute;n will handle a complaint; the kinds of resolutions for complaints available to an coimisi&uacute;n; a requirement for an coimisi&uacute;n to set out a plan for operationalising these provisions; and a requirement for an coimisi&uacute;n to prioritise operationalising the individual complaints mechanism for children in the first instance.<\/p><p>The remainder of the amendments in this grouping - amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, 43, 82, 108, 118 to 120, inclusive, 124 to 128, inclusive, 130 to 136, inclusive, 146, 148 to 256, inclusive, 258 to 264, inclusive, 266 to 269, inclusive, 272 to 292, inclusive, 317 and 318 - are consequential to amendment No. 118 and relate to the necessary renumbering of sections throughout the Bill to account for the insertion of amendment No. 118.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B00900","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten looks worried that we will be here all night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01000","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":967,"content":"<p>I nearly had a full house there with all those numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":968,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":969,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, line 34, to delete &ldquo;section 139ZZ(2)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 139ZZH(2)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":970,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, line 36, to delete &ldquo;section 139ZZ(3)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 139ZZH(3)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01500","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":972,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 6, to delete &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Coimisin&eacute;ir&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01700","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":974,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":975,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 9, 10, 137 and 265 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01900","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":976,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6: <\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 30, to delete &ldquo;definition&rdquo; where it firstly occurs and substitute &ldquo;definitions&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>These are purely technical amendments inserting a definition of the e-commerce directive into section 2 of the 2009 Act, which concerns definitions.

Mhol na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; Warfield, &Oacute; Donnghaile, Gavan agus Boylan leas&uacute; ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste sa Seanad.  Ar Ch&eacute;im na Tuarasc&aacute;la sa Seanad thug m&eacute; ar aghaidh leas&uacute; ar an Bhille ina bhfor&aacute;iltear in alt 7(3)(c) den Acht Craolach&aacute;in 2009, a dtagann an Bille ina &aacute;it, go nd&eacute;anfaidh an coimisi&uacute;n &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a spreagadh sna me&aacute;in cumars&aacute;ide a fheidhm&iacute;tear sa St&aacute;t.  This is a broader duty than proposed by the Deputies given that it encompasses the print media in addition to broadcasters, video-on-demand services and online services.  I, therefore, do not accept amendment No. 21.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I leas&uacute; Uimh. 20, d&rsquo;fhor&aacute;lfa&iacute; go bhf&eacute;adfadh an coimisi&uacute;n athbhreithnithe strait&eacute;iseacha a dh&eacute;anamh ar na hearn&aacute;lacha a riala&iacute;onn an coimisi&uacute;n maidir le craolach&aacute;n i nGaeilge.  The committee will be aware that the Report of the Future of Media Commission recommends that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n should conduct a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system, with a focus on institutional structures and opportunities for innovation and collaboration as well as strategies for youth engagement and Irish language education.  Amendment No. 20 would confine the strategic review to broadcasting in the Irish language whereas the comprehensive review to be undertaken by an coimisi&uacute;n will be broader in scope and include digital media.  Accordingly, I do not intend to accept it.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I leas&uacute; Uimh. 33 cheangl&oacute;fa&iacute; go gcuirf&iacute; sonra&iacute; faoi leith maidir le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha sna me&aacute;in san &aacute;ireamh sa r&aacute;iteas strait&eacute;ise a ullmha&iacute;onn an coimisi&uacute;n.

However, we are taking action to increase the quantity of Irish language advertising.  As the committee will be aware, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, recently brought the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 through the Oireachtas.  As a consequence, section 10A of the Official Languages Act, as amended, will, when commenced, require public bodies to spend at least 20% of their advertising budgets on Irish language advertisements, with at least 5% to be placed through Irish language media.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 320 would amend the Long Title of the Bill to reference specifically the role of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n regarding the use and visibility of the Irish language.  The Long Title of the Bill is not intended to capture or reference comprehensively every duty of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n nor to reference one in particular.  Rather, it is intended to set out the broad contents of the Bill.  Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#D00200","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#D00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>Yes.

N&iacute; l&eacute;im mh&oacute;r at&aacute; i gceist m&aacute; ghlacfaimid leis na leasuithe seo.

N&iacute; ghlacaim leis gur ag cur as go m&oacute;r do na commercial media a bheadh aon fhor&aacute;lacha a t&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo anseo.

Therefore, if we put any provisions and additions on top of the duties and responsibilities of commercial media they get on with it.  They understand that is a duty to allow them to continue to broadcast and operate in the State.  It should not be seen as a duty but in some ways as just one of those issues they must comply with.  In this case it is a positive duty they would have to ensure the promotion of the Irish language and our traditions.  If we were to leave this on the exact same footing as all other languages in the country there is a danger the Irish language and its traditions will remain as an afterthought for many of the media.  I welcome the changes that have happened in recent years.  I am not blind to them.  I welcome the huge investment in TG4 and the fact we will have a children's TG4 soon enough.  There is a lot more to do about the damage done as a result of the Irish language being ignored by our national media for so many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#D00400","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 16:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 19, line 16, after &ldquo;traditions,&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo;in particular, the duty not only to satisfy existing demand but to stimulate increased demand for Irish language programming and content, in line with the national aim of restoring the Irish language as a spoken language nationwide,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#E00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy wish to speak to the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#E00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>I have just spoken to it because they were grouped.

However, it is important that we retain flexibility in this regard to ensure the widest array of candidates are available on establishment of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.

As the officials will know, this is an issue that was discussed at length a number of years ago.  The intention was to reduce the levy to the independent broadcasters, in recognition of the public service remit they are providing through the radio stations.  The rules in Standing Orders mean it is not possible for me to table such an amendment here as it would be ruled out of order by the Chair, so I have used this mechanism to raise this issue with the Minister in the hope she can indicate that she is prepared to look again at the broadcasting levy.<\/p><p>One of the big problems with the broadcasting levy as it is structured is that it is regressive and disproportionate, particularly for smaller radio stations.  They are the ones that are struggling to remain viable and yet they are the most important aspect of the broadcasting network at local level throughout the country.  We have taken the decision, and rightly so, to waive the fees for community radio stations.  We are unique globally in having a thriving community radio station network.  It is a positive development that we are waiving those fees.  With the way the levy is calculated currently, all broadcasters, regardless of size or turnover, pay the same percentage on the first tranche of money.  Following that, the more money a broadcaster makes, the less of a percentage they pay on those higher amounts.  It disproportionately penalises the smaller stations.  The intention behind this is to give recognition to the public information role provided by radio stations.<\/p><p>This came to the fore during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  Storm Ophelia was the high winds of 2017, which led to a tragic loss of life.  A huge amount of our electricity network throughout the country was disrupted, and that had a knock-on impact on broadband and mobile phone coverage.  The only way the State could get vital public information out to communities throughout this country was through local radio stations and the local radio network.  The same happened with Storm Emma, or the beast from the east as it was called, in spring 2018.  A huge amount of our existing infrastructure was brought down, and we are becoming more reliant on broadband and electricity.  One is co-dependent on the other.  If electricity goes, our broadband and mobile networks go, and as a result of that the only mechanism to get a message across to the public is through our local radio stations.<\/p><p>When we do the be winter-ready campaign, one of the elements in relation to that should be to actively encourage people to have an old radio and a set of batteries so that they can tune in to the local radio station and get updates on the return of electricity, on water supplies, emergency services and where services can be availed of, because it is only on a local radio station that such a level of information can be given out.  During those two especially severe weather events, we were all so dependent on our local radio stations to give us vital information.  RT&Eacute; and the national broadcasters were great, but they were not going to be able to tell a rural townland in County Roscommon or County Galway when their electricity was likely to be back.  They could not go into that level of detail.  However, the local radio station could and did give it.  That must be recognised.  There should be recognition in terms of a reduction in the broadcasting levy.  That was before we saw the financial impact of Covid-19 on many broadcasters.  Many of the smaller ones now are struggling at this stage.  They are the ones that are so vital across many rural areas.  Could the Minister look at the proposals and commitments that have been given previously for a reduction in the broadcasting levy, and provide us with clarity and an intention to come back on Report Stage to amend the legislation in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#G01100","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1061,"content":"<p>I support my colleague, Deputy Naughten, in what he said.

That is very important.<\/p> <p>  The other benefit provided by local radio stations is the local connection for people who are at home who want to listen to their local club match on the radio and to hear how things are going every Saturday and Sunday evening.

Where people cannot go to matches or local mass, they can hear coverage on the radio.  All of that kind of service is now provided by local radio stations and we take it for granted now.

We are all aware of local radio stations in our area.  The listenership is of massive proportions.  People might listen to national radio for an hour or so, but inevitably they will always switch back to their local radio for news and, as other speakers have said, for information following storms.  Local radio can offer all of that vital information to local communities.  There is justification for a reduction in the levy, given that they pay the same levy as other stations that have a far bigger listenership and revenue.

I know the value of local radio in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The industry levy contained in section 21 of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, is based on the principle that each category of service pays for the cost of activities related to that service so that there is no cross-subsidisation of one sector by another.  This is an important general regulatory principle and one I do not think we should depart from.  However, it is important to note that the Bill already provides that up to 50% of the cost of regulating broadcasting can be met through the TV licence.  This was carried over from the Broadcasting Bill, which Deputy Naughten in particular progressed.  However, the Deputies will also be aware that a technical working has been established to look at reforms to the TV licence and we must let that group complete its work.  Members will also be aware of the additional funding I mentioned earlier that has been put in place for radio through the sound and vision fund.

The difficulty I have here is that, as the Minister said, up to 50% of the cost of the levy can be met from the TV licence fee.  That is not to say it will be met from the TV licence fee.  As we all know well, the difficulty is that when the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get their claws into this, nothing will happen.  What we are seeking is greater clarity on the commitment that there is a determination, in particular for the smaller stations, that they would see a reduction in the levy and that there would be a recognition of the important public service role they play.  We have seen at first hand the importance of these stations during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  My fear is that with the commercial squeeze that is being put on many of the smaller radio stations the current disproportionate structure of the broadcasting levy would result in many of them going out of business.  We would see the amalgamation of stations take place that will not be able to give the information, for example, on what went on in Bridgetown, or when the electricity will be back in 50 townlands across a listenership area.  That is the type of detail that was provided during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  It is not possible for RT&Eacute; or regional radio stations to give that level of detail.  They can advise people to go on to their websites or Twitter accounts for a breakdown in that regard but the reality is that if the electricity to the local mobile phone mast is gone down, and the broadband cable is damaged, along with the electricity cable, people have no Internet.  Any online forum is of no use.  The only way to get a message to people across the board is through the local radio station.<\/p> <p>  We must make sure that those radio stations can survive.

It is great to hear a Minister who is very much aware of the power and value of local radio.  While these stations are ultimately commercial ventures, they serve a particular public need.  They are not obliged to in the main but they feel they must.  Many of us in this room have cited those occasions on which local radio becomes vital in terms of communicating directly with local communities.  I hope that in how we look at how we structure and fund the provision of public service news gathering and dissemination in the future, and that is across print and broadcast, we strike that balance to ensure the public service remit of local radio is supported, as we have done recently with our print media.  I hope a similar gesture of support is extended to local broadcasters.  It is vital this happens.

The statutory rules for television adverting require advance clearance of ads, but the ASAI can only act on potential breaches after complaints have been made following broadcast.  That is futile.

First, on the individual complaints mechanism, I have read through the amendments and it seems very vague on the powers of the media commission to force the big tech companies to deal with an actual complaint.  I refer to amendment No. 118 which refers to the new section 139T(1)(a).  It mentions \"referring the complaint to the provider concerned with such advice, guidance or support as the Commission considers appropriate\".  In terms of a complaint, going to the big tech companies in relation to the provision of advice or guidance is far too weak.  All of us here and many of our constituents have had personal experience of dealing with the tech companies.  Any individual who is unfortunate enough to have had a run-in with a tech company knows they are not that interested in what a complainant has to say.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to make a clarification on the powers that the media commission has to force the tech companies to act on a complaint when a genuine complaint is being made.<\/p><p> The second issue I want to raise also concerns the powers of the commission.  It relates to the right to be forgotten.  In the Minister's contribution on section 7, she made the point that one of the first aspects of the media fund that is going to be looked at is the issue of court reporting.  One of the key purposes of court reporting is to report in  public what has gone on in court.  Court hearings are supposed to be held in public and the reports are supposed to be published for that reason.  There have been a number of instances where Google has used the right to be forgotten to actually expunge the public record in relation to convicted sex offenders.  I believe that for the sake of victims who have lived with the consequences of these perpetrators, and that of any potential future victims, those convicted of sexual offences should lose the right to be forgotten on a permanent basis.  Google should not facilitate the deletion of these records.  The law on GDPR clearly states that companies like Google have a legitimate reason for rejecting requests for the erasure of such records when it is in the public interest.  I believe that above all areas where it is in the public interest, records of conviction for sexual offences should remain available to search via Google or any other search engine.  Those records should never be delisted.  Yet, the big tech companies are doing this.  I believe that the commission has a role to play here in ensuring that companies such as Google protect the court records, ensure that they are searchable and accessible, and that where victims waive the right of anonymity, the very last thing that should happen is that a tech company down the road decides that it is going to delist that particular record.  That is a further abuse of the victims involved.  I ask the Minister to look at the issue in advance on Report Stage of this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#L01300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>Deputy Niamh Smyth resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#M00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1113,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, the online safety codes deal with the rules on complaints handling.

In this instance, it concerns the issue, as someone described it to me, of the decapitated teddy bear that appears on the television every now and again.  When the map of Ireland appears, suddenly a whole section is removed and the Six Counties do not exist for the purposes of weather forecasts and other programmes.  There must be a duty to ensure that the island as a whole is reflected in weather forecasts.  People may wish to ignore it, but Ireland is still an island.  We should not leave a blank space there.  The Six Counties have not disappeared or gone into space.  One of the other amendments that was ruled out of order addresses the issue of geoblocking and the RT&Eacute; Player service not extending to parts of the Six Counties.  The purpose of amendment No. 45 is to ensure that the national public service broadcaster will have a duty to reflect the island as a whole, and that any graphic or pictorial representation will be faithful, as it were, to the island of Ireland as a geographical whole.  As I have said, this amendment is an attempt on our part to ensure that that is reflected.  People have been raising the issue for many years.  Parts of Ireland disappear as if they do not exist.  In the case of geoblocking, those who are accepted as part of the Irish nation under the Constitution have no rights.  I do not live in the Border region, but as other Deputies here will be able to attest to, there needs to be a proper approach on a national basis to prevent restrictions and ensure that broadcasting continues throughout the island and that no mechanism is put in place that restricts the national broadcasters from one part of the island to the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#M01100","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>As I noted when this issue was raised in the Seanad, I understand the intention of the amendment and why it is troubling for people living on the island of Ireland watching the public service broadcasters to see their part of the island of Ireland removed from maps.

That is not political interference but rather an editorial decision.<\/p> <p>  What I am asking is reflective of the Constitution, concerning the birthright of every person born on the island of Ireland to be part of that nation, and there is a description in the Constitution regarding what the island of Ireland is.  It is not just the singular, large island but also includes the seas around it.  I find it odd.  If I thought it could be achieved by encouraging national broadcasters, or any broadcasters that get a licence from the State and that will be regulated by the coimisi&uacute;n, to ensure it does not happen, I would be happy with that.

The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 39:  \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo;<b>Duties to the Irish Language<\/b> <blockquote> \t<b>39A<\/b>.(1) All audiovisual media service providers and sound media broadcasters in the State have a duty to support the promotion of the Irish language as the national language.<br \/><br \/>(2) The Commission shall examine the feasibility and merit of setting mandatory minimum content requirements for percentage of content in the Irish language through the awarding of television programme contract and sound broadcast contract licences to be introduced by 31 December 2030, with a higher obligation for public service broadcasters and local broadcasters service Gaeltacht areas, and with a view towards progressively increasing these content requirements over the periods from 2030 to 2035 and again from 2035 to 2040.  The Commission shall publish a report no later than one year following its establishment, which shall be laid before the Minister, both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the Joint Oireachtas Committee, outlining the findings of this examination and proposing recommendations for the implementation of such mandatory minimum content requirements for the Irish language.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>These amendments, as the Chairperson said, are related.  Amendment No. 48 seeks a requirement for a certain percentage of broadcasting to be done as Gaeilge.  Amendment No. 62 seeks to ensure a certain percentage of the music broadcast is in the Irish language or of European origin.  Amendment No. 64 relates to a provision that may have been overtaken by Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  That amendment would require 20% of advertising to be as Gaeilge.  Beyond that, we have a report that proposes a move for between 50% and 100% of the advertising on TG4 in particular to be as Gaeilge.  I will go through these amendments, bit by bit.  Amendment No. 84 is the one from Cumann na Gaeilge.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 48 concerns setting a minimum percentage of the content of television or sound broadcasting to be as Gaeilge.  Over the years, we have found that those who were meant, or promised, to ensure a certain percentage never achieved it.  That includes the State broadcasters other than TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  The proposal is that the commission would examine this issue, come back within a certain period of time and thereafter set five-year targets, if that is acceptable.  It proposes that the commission would publish a report within a year, which could open a discussion about feasibility.  Television and radio broadcasters operate under a licence.  It is not an open licence.  Because the State is granting the licence, it can set conditions.  As I said earlier about another amendment, broadcasters accept those conditions.  Those are the conditions on which they were granted the licence and they are meant to deliver on them.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 62 speaks in some ways to something Deputy Canney and others mentioned earlier.  I have another amendment too.  This amendment intends to encourage Irish traditional music by ensuring that a percentage of air time is reserved for it.  The threshold is set quite low as the amendment would require at least 5% to be reserved for musical composition containing lyrics mostly in the Irish language by 2025, with that increasing to 10% by 2030.  It is to ensure that the content being broadcast fulfils those criteria as a condition of a licence being granted.  It would be a means of promoting Irish musicians and ensuring that they benefit.<\/p><p>The amendment also seeks to ensure that lyrics are not only in the English language.  There is an element intended to ensure we have music from within the EU in order to diversify the content on radio stations.  It would ensure that lyrical content is not only in English, as we have seen on some channels.  In many cases, not only do the presenters speak English but the music they present is entirely in the English language.  Many of our communities, therefore, do not experience a lot of the music one would hear on the Continent.  On the Continent, members of the younger generation in particular switch between languages.  There is a predominance of English among teenage and youthful audiences but there are fantastic musicians who cannot be heard on Irish radio.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 64 relates to a matter that is a bugbear for many who love and enjoy TG4.  Their frustration is that they are listening and immersed in TG4 before all of a sudden, because of a need for commercially viable, advertising is, in some instances, fully as B&eacute;arla.  That is fine for some people who can switch between languages but others find that frustrating and it takes them a while to refocus.  There is a question as to whether an Irish-language broadcaster should be broadcasting anything in English.  I raised that point when I met representatives of TG4 recently.  They told me there would be a cost involved but not necessarily a cost on the television station.  The cost would fall to those making the advertising.  Having spoken to people within the advertising industry, they understand, given what is coming down the track in respect of the Official Languages Act, there will be an increase in funding for Irish-language advertising.  They would consider that an incentive.  This amendment is intended to ensure the incentive is more than just a few extra advertisements on TG4.  It seeks to ensure that TG4 can demand or request of its advertisers that they produce advertisements in Irish.  That can include voice-overs when the content is made initially and advertising with no words at all, which many of the clever advertisers are doing at the moment.<\/p><p>Once advertisers know this, it is a lot cheaper to do initially when they are putting an advertisement together rather than having to recast or dub over it.  If they understood that this was a requirement under legislation, they would definitely refocus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#O01200","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 48, 62, 64 and 84 would have the effect of setting quotas for the provision of broadcast content and the proportion of advertisements that must be in the Irish language.  Deputies may be aware that a number of amendments were proposed on Seanad Committee and Report Stages regarding gender- and nationality-based quotas in respect of musical works on sound broadcasting services and a quota for participation on news and current affairs programmes.  I indicated to Senators at the time that I would carefully consider those proposals.<\/p><p>On foot of legal advice from the Attorney General on the proposed quotas considered on foot of the Seanad Stages of the Bill, I decided not to introduce any provision for them here on Committee Stage.  Instead, the Government agreed that an amendment should be drafted to provide that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services, and to promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services.  I intend to introduce these amendments on Report Stage.  I raise this now in this context because the advice of the Attorney General has a bearing on my approach to the issue of placing binding quotas for certain types of content in primary legislation.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 48<b><\/b>seeks to impose a general duty on audiovisual media service providers and sound broadcasters in the State to promote the Irish language and requires coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to examine the feasibility and merit of setting out minimum requirements for the provision of content in the Irish language through television programme service and sound broadcasting contracts.  As Deputies will be aware, the duties placed on broadcasters through Chapter 2 of Part 3B of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by section 9, are intended to protect the rights of audiences and individuals rather than to compel broadcasters to take a particular action.<\/p><p>On quotas, as the advice received from the Attorney General in respect of gender-based quotas I referred to earlier indicates, there are a series of complex legal questions associated with quotas relating to competition law and freedom of expression.  There are already clear avenues for us to take action to support Irish language programming through increased funding and supports.  For example, I have increased funding for TG4 by 40% since I entered office, from &euro;37.2 million in 2020 to &euro;52.2 million in 2023.  I agree that we should explore what further steps should be taken to promote the Irish language.  These could include making express provision through media service codes, as I intend to do on Report Stage, regarding the promotion of gender balance and musical works composed by or performed by women.  However, I do not agree that an amendment requiring a report to be prepared is appropriate, given that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will be undertaking a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system.  I believe that we should await the results of the review and accordingly cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 62 would set a quota on sound broadcasting services regarding time dedicated to music containing lyrics, mostly in the Irish language, from 5% from 2026 rising to 10% from 2031.  The amendment would also provide that 40% of music broadcast in the English language should be reserved for musical works composed by at least one Irish or European Economic Area national.  I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music and compositions performed in Irish on our broadcasting services.  Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world.  As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am keen to ensure appropriate supports are in place to nurture and protect this sector further.<\/p><p>However, following the advice of the Attorney General received regarding gender-based quotas, I am acutely conscious of the legal and other factors that must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing airplay quotas.  I understand the Deputies have drafted the amendment to seek to ensure compliance with EU law, as a language-based airplay quota has been successfully introduced by the French authorities, for example.  From a policy perspective, the potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue, particularly in the context of the current media climate.  I do not think the legal or policy complexities can be resolved in the timeframe of this Bill and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.  However, this is a matter that can be considered in the context of the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 64<b><\/b>would require audiovisual media service providers, including broadcasters, to ensure that at least 20% of advertisements made available on the service would be in the Irish language from 2026.  As I indicated earlier, we have already placed a duty on public bodies to ensure that at least 20% of advertising placed is in the Irish language.  In addition to concerns regarding the legal complexities of any quotas, this amendment may have a number of unintended effects that would require careful consideration.  First, the measure could reduce the revenues that broadcasters could earn if there is not a sufficient supply of Irish language advertising from advertisers to produce content in the Irish language.  For example, if a broadcaster currently broadcasts 95% of advertisements in English, a 20% quota could lead to a significant drop in advertising revenue, if advertisers do not first correspondingly increase their production of Irish language advertising and price it accordingly.  There is also a risk that there comes to be, in effect, two advertising pricing structures, one for English language advertising and one for Irish language advertising.  Second, given the country-of-origin principle that underpins the audiovisual media services directive, this requirement could only apply to audiovisual media service providers registered or licensed here in Ireland.  Accordingly, services regulated in other member states that target Irish audiences would not be bound by the quota, potentially increasing their share of revenue earned from advertising<i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>Irish services.  As the broadcasting sector in particular already faces significant challenges to advertising revenues due to the change in ways that content is consumed, I am of the view significant analysis and consultation with stakeholders would be required before considering such a change.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 84<b><\/b>would require that sound broadcasting service contracts and television programme service contracts include a provision requiring broadcasters to provide at least 30 minutes of programming in Irish between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  I will not accept this amendment today.  As with the Deputies' other proposed amendments, this is a matter that could be considered by the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system that will be undertaken by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#P00200","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response, some of which I was aware of when I put the amendments together.  Again, these amendments are borne out of frustration.  For instance, the BAI had the duty to ensure local broadcasters, even in Gaeltacht areas, had special regard to the needs of the Irish language community.  We know from the report by Dr. John Walsh and Dr. Rosemary Day that Galway Bay FM broadcast 0% in Irish, even though it broadcasts in Gaeltacht areas, and nothing was done about it.  This amendment is about trying to ensure, at minimum, that there would be a target that is implementable and a body, in this case an coimisi&uacute;n, that could ensure that would happen.  Dr. Walsh and Dr. Day produced a comprehensive report on the level of Irish language broadcasting by broadcasters, in particular, local broadcasters, throughout the country.  These broadcasters knowingly accepted their licences and were encouraged over the years to increase the very minimal amount of Irish language broadcasting they were producing, whether they were transmitting Irish traditional music, Irish language music or other music.<\/p> <p>  From meetings of this committee and previous committees, other Deputies will know of discussions on how we ensure local and national broadcasters broadcast our own music.  These amendments are attempts to reflect, as the Minister mentioned, the French example.<\/p><p>I remember over the years people saying we could not do various things because of EU law, whereas France is doing it.  I do not know if the French are getting away with it or if they have a better understanding of EU law than we have.  Maybe an coimisi&uacute;n can look at it when it is carrying out its comprehensive analysis of Irish broadcasting.  I hope that comprehensive analysis can be completed quite quickly and will have an effect so that it is not necessary for us to come back here in some years' time still frustrated or more frustrated with the lack of progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#P00300","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>Section 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 49:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 49, line 33, to delete &ldquo;<b>: &lsquo;relevant media service provider&rsquo;<\/b>&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#Q00500","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 50:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 49, line 34, to delete &ldquo;Part,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Part&mdash;&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#Q00700","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1156,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 51 to 58, inclusive, and 67 to 76, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#Q00900","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 51:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 49, line 34, after &ldquo;Part,&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo; &lsquo;party political programme&rsquo; means a programme broadcast, or made available in a catalogue of an audiovisual on-demand media service, by or on behalf of a political party for the purpose of promoting the political party;<br \/><br \/>&lsquo;political party&rsquo; means a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties;&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>Section 46M(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill as passed by the Seanad, retains the prohibition on advertisements of a political nature and the derogation from that prohibition in the case of &quot;party political programmes&quot;, previously known as &quot;party political broadcasts&quot;.

This will align the language in the Bill with the standard of &ldquo;harm or undue offence&rdquo; to material applied by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland through its code of programme standards, ensuring that the statutory provisions align with the practical implementation of the prohibition.<\/p><p>In qualifying the term &quot;offence&quot; the amendment recognises what the BAI recognises in practice, which is that there is no guarantee that programme material will be free from offence, given that the definition of &quot;offence&quot; varies from person to person.  However, the amendment will still guard audiences against undue offence which shall continue to be enforced by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n through media service codes.<\/p><p>In this context I also note that the Bill contains numerous safeguards in respect of fundamental rights, not least that one of the primary functions of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n is to uphold the democratic values in the Constitution, including freedom of expression.  However, it must be stated that the right to freedom of expression is not absolute and, like all other rights, is subject to balancing the law to ensure that the rights of others, for example the right to safety and security, are not unduly infringed.  This principle of rights balancing is recognised in Irish law, EU law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.  I am confident that this Bill sits comfortably within those traditions.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 65 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 59.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#Q03000","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>The word \"offence\" is very broad and it is hard to narrow it down.

I read section 46L(7) as saying RT&Eacute; can waive the 20% requirement of a news service across its seven radio stations, namely, Radio 1, 2FM, Lyric FM, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, Gold, Pulse and 2XM.  That was never the intention of legislation in this area.  It is important all of the national broadcast stations run news content and that it is news content relevant to their particular audience.  The last thing we need is a situation where we have national broadcast stations devoid of news content or where there is uniform news content across a number of channels.  Each of these stations specifically targets a particular section of the population and it is imperative that news content is targeted at each particular section.  With the way technology has gone now, this may be the only independent, unbiased news content these particular listeners get.  My reading of this legislation as drafted is that RT&Eacute;, by carrying its news content on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, would not have to provide news content on the likes of 2FM.  Every single person who pays for a TV licence would be very concerned to think a news channel targeted at young people would not have a news service and one that is specifically targeted at its audience and listenership.  I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify this.  I hope I am wrong in my interpretation but clarity is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#R01500","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1194,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his amendment.  Section 46L(5) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, seeks to reflect the current policy regarding the requirement for sound broadcasting services to devote a set amount of broadcast time to news and current affairs programmes.  This is subject to a derogation that may be issued by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to a licensed radio service.  This derogation is currently exercised by the BAI with radio stations such as Christmas FM.<\/p> <p>  The amendment brought by Deputies Naughten and Canney would remove section 46L(7), which provides that the various radio services provided by RT&Eacute; are covered as one radio service for the purposes of the news and current affairs requirement.  As Deputies are aware, RT&Eacute; radio services are not licensed by the BAI, nor will they be licensed by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  Instead, RT&Eacute; services are subject to extensive statutory duties set out in Part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Accordingly, it is not possible for the BAI, and will not be possible for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, to offer a derogation to RT&Eacute; from the requirement to set aside a minimum amount of time to news and current affairs programming.  For that reason, the Bill provides that RT&Eacute; services may be considered as one service for the purposes of the minimum requirements.  If the Bill did not have this provision, Lyric FM would be subject to the minimum requirement as much as Radio 1, with no recourse for a derogation, unlike all other radio services.  This would have negative implications for both RT&Eacute; and audiences, who currently have considerable choice across RT&Eacute; services, while being well served by news and current affairs programming.  That is why I cannot accept this amendment.  The practical effect of the amendment would be to require more news bulletins on, for example, Lyric FM.  In the longer term that would create a disproportionate requirement on RT&Eacute; which, unlike licensed broadcasters, would be unable to avail of this derogation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#R01600","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>Therefore what I am saying is correct.

Due to algorithms, the only other news content young people get is in a news bubble.  The only way they are going to get unbiased news content about what is going on in the country may be through this particular channel and the Minister is now giving RT&Eacute; a waiver for that.  This is bad for democracy.  It is bad for the social cohesion of the country and we are treading a very dangerous avenue by going down this route.

In this case we propose a levy which could be imposed on music sharing and sound streaming media platforms such as Spotify.  The levy would be used to fund a scheme to be administered by the Arts Council to support the creation, production and performance of Irish music and programming of traditional sound broadcasting services such as radio stations that air Irish music.  The Minister mentioned the sound and vision fund.  This would probably complement that if we put a levy on the likes of Spotify, although I am not picking on Spotify only.  There are quite a number of platforms.  Similar to amendment No. 62 which was already discussed, we are not limiting this to Irish language music but also including music of Irish cultural expression, in line with the criteria used in Canada, which are music, artist, performance and lyrics, MAPL, which would cover music and lyrics composed by a resident on the island of Ireland, in this case an artist resident on the island, or a performance recorded in Ireland.  There are measures already used for rights when music is played, but artists from elsewhere in the European Union, because we are in the European Union, would not be excluded from receiving this funding as long as they perform in Ireland or performed music composed by an Irish resident.  This is to ensure we are in compliance with any EU rules or directives.<\/p><p>The aim is to address three problems.  The first is that musicians are struggling.  This gives them a bit more bargaining power and allows them to earn more because their music will be played, the idea being to encourage the playing of their music or for them to have access to funding from the fund created by this levy.  Second, radio stations are struggling to compete against the likes of Spotify and others.  There is an over-reliance on commercially produced music from America and Britain.  I discussed this earlier.  There is not a clear Irish identity.  This would encourage local radio stations to play local musicians and there would be financial reward for those musicians.  Third, a massive amount of money from those listening to Irish music leaves these shores to go to streaming services which have no loyalty to Ireland, as money has no loyalty once it goes into the commercial sphere.  This is a way of ensuring they pay a dividend.  The amendment sets a 20% levy.  Some might argue that is too high.  We could start at a lower rate.  This is based on discussions over the years going back to former Deputy Willie Penrose, which is neither today or yesterday, arguing for the need for a fund to be ring-fenced to ensure we can protect Irish musicians, encourage them and ensure their music is heard in Ireland at the same level, if at all possible, as some music which is commercially produced in English and that comes from other jurisdictions such as the United States and Britain.  Now, with Britain out of the EU, this would be encouraged by the EU and I do not think it would be contrary to any EU legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#S01000","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendments.  As I understand it, the purpose of the amendment is, first, to allow coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to identify and designate providers of what are referred to as sound streaming media and music sharing platform services; second, to provide for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to impose a levy of 20% on the revenues of those providers earned in the State; and third, for the proceeds of the levy to be granted to the Arts Council for the purposes of making schemes to support the production of Irish music.<\/p><p> As the committee knows, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am firmly committed to supporting Irish art and artists, including musicians, across all practices.  That is why I brought forward the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will provide &euro;325 per week to support 2,000 artists, including 584 musicians over three years, and allocated an additional &euro;2 million to the sound and vision scheme to support the live music-related programming this year.  I understand the intention of the amendment is to raise further funds to support the Irish artists.  I also understand the concerns that have been raised by musicians and artists regarding their remuneration for content consumed through music streaming services.  This is a complex area and, in the first instance, I would emphasise that copyright law is a matter for Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p><p> The committee will understand why I cannot accept this amendment.  It represents a major policy departure requiring extensive analysis and consideration, with a number of complex legal and policy questions that need to be addressed.  I would have a number of specific concerns regarding the amendment being proposed here.  First, I note there is no explicit legal basis in EU law for such as levy.  As Deputies are aware, the revised audiovisual media services directive applies to audiovisual broadcasters, video on demand services and video sharing platform services.  The provisions in Article 13(2) of the directive, which provide the legal basis for the content production levy contained in this Bill, are directed at audiovisual broadcasters and video on demand services.  In particular, the innovation of Article 13(2) of the directive is explicitly to permit the levying of video on demand services targeting audiences in the State.  Second, it is unclear whether net revenue is intended to be analogous to taxable profit under the tax code or refers to post-tax revenue.  In either case, what is being proposed appears to be similar to the current corporation tax, albeit that it seeks to tax revenue that is earned by a service.  I would note, in that context, that the rate proposed is considerably higher than the current rate of corporation tax.  It would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider a levy on net revenue in the first instance.  Finally, the proposal would appear to target only those sound streaming services that are under the jurisdiction of the State, which I take to mean are established here.  Accordingly, the levy would not appear to apply to the major services located outside the State.  There is a risk then that those services currently established here would simply seek to relocate to another member state to avoid the levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#S01100","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1210,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment.
