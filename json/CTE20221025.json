I welcome this opportunity to present the SIA to the committee today.  As in previous years, a rigorous assessment has been undertaken to examine the implications for Ireland of the potential fishing opportunities for the year ahead.  The past few years, as we know, have been particularly challenging for our fishing industry.  In addition to the continuing fuel crisis, the impact of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and the quota transfers under the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, TCA, are still having an effect.  I assure the Chairperson that I as Minister and the Government continue to keep the focus on the disproportionate quota reductions for Ireland under the TCA and to use any and every opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.  I am keeping a strong focus on the matter within the Fisheries Council and making it clear that the TCA transfers must be addressed within the EU.<\/p> <p>  The UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU has also led to significant changes to the processes involved in setting total allowable catches, TACs, for the majority of our commercial fish stocks.  Approximately 40 of Ireland&rsquo;s fish stocks, which were previously exclusively European Union resources, are now shared resources, most shared with the UK.  The Commission has the sole competence to negotiate with third countries on behalf of the EU for the setting of fishing opportunities for shared stocks.  Unfortunately, the UK now counts as a third country.  The bilateral negotiations between the Commission, on behalf of the EU, and the UK are due to begin in November and I will go into more detail on these consultations in a moment.  Based on the experience of the last year post Brexit and the changes, this has led to in the procedures for setting fishing opportunities for the EU, I decided that the SIA process should commence at the start of October rather than later to be as relevant as possible.  The SIA is an essential step in Ireland&rsquo;s preparation for the TAC setting process and I want to have the process completed before we commence the EU-UK consultations.  Carrying out the process at this stage allows for input from stakeholders, analysis by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Marine Institute and the views of the Oireachtas in time for the start of the TAC setting process.  As the Chair outlined, I am joined by two representatives, Dr. Ciaran Kelly from the Marine Institute, who is a scientific expert, and Mr. Dominic Rihan, a socioeconomic impact expert from Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  As the Chair outlined, Ms Josephine Kelly and Dr. Cecil Beamish from my own team are also in attendance.<\/p> <p>  I decided to again use the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES's, scientific advice as the basis for this year&rsquo;s SIA.  The ICES advice forms the basis of the scientific advice used by the Commission.  The ICES gathers scientific advice; its advice for the relevant stock provides suitable guidance for the TAC figures which would normally be proposed by the Commission.  This allowed for a meaningful public consultation and for realistic engagement with our stakeholders.  It allowed the Marine Institute and BIM to produce the biological and socioeconomic impact assessments to inform us.  The waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  We have a duty of care and a national self-interest to protect their biological richness and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  The landing obligation, which aims to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding fish, has been fully implemented since 2019.  The practical application of the landing obligation has been challenging for operators, requiring changes in fishing practices and behaviour.  However, my Department along with BIM continue to work together with fishers to adapt and develop the most selective and sustainable fishing methods.  The efforts and commitment of our fishers in this matter have been and remain important.<\/p> <p>  Another key feature of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is the setting of TACs and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield.  Fishing at maximum sustainable yield, FMSY, is the largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions.  Of course, in the past, a failure to fish at FMSY and a failure also to have the scientific assessment that we so rely on led to overfishing in some instances of stocks and a depletion of stocks.  It is important for sustainable stocks every year going forward that we do not take any more from that stock than would undermine its health and the size of the stock so that the fish will be there next year and the year after.  Progress is being achieved in terms of the sustainability of fish stocks.  For 2022, 38 stocks of interest to Ireland have been fished below maximum sustainable yield.  In 2013, only 20 stocks were fished at this sustainable level.  It is now up at 38 from 20 back in 2013.  The number of stocks overfished is 15 in 2022, down from 22 in previous years.  This is a significant achievement and Ireland will continue to work with stakeholders, the Commission, other member states and third countries to build on this tangible progress to achieve our objectives of healthy fish stocks and sustainable fishing.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to take this opportunity to update the committee on the upcoming report by the European Commission on the functioning of the CFP.  Under the CFP regulation, the European Commission is required to report to the European Parliament and the European Council on the functioning of the CFP by the end of this year.<\/p><p>The Commission has indicated that its report on the functioning of the CFP will take the form of a communication, analysing the dimensions of the CFP and looking at the interaction between fisheries management and the objectives of the European Green Deal.  In addition, the communication will address the social dimension of the CFP and consider how to improve the delivery of the CFP policy objectives.  I have consistently made clear the Government&rsquo;s assessment that the substantial changes brought about in fisheries policy as a result of the TCA, requires that a comprehensive review of the CFP be carried out within the EU to support changes to deliver a fair and equitable policy.<br\/><br\/>Earlier this year, I established a national Common Fisheries Policy review group, bringing together relevant stakeholders to examine the issues that arise for Ireland in the context of the CFP review; to advise me on priorities for the negotiations; and importantly, to identify strategies most likely to influence the outcome of the review.  The group was chaired by Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who was assisted by a steering committee comprising Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinneide, former director of the Marine Institute and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; and Mr. Donal Maguire, former director of BIM.  I thank the three of them and all stakeholders for their work.<br\/><br\/>The group involved representatives of all key stakeholders, including industry representative groups, fisheries representatives and the environmental NGOs.  That review group submitted its final report to me on 5 August 2022.  The stakeholders have set out a number of recommendations on aspects of the CFP that need to be addressed to adapt to the monumental changes of recent years and ensure a sustainable future for the sector.<br\/><br\/>I have forwarded a copy of the report to the EU fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkeviius, who is responsible for the CFP review.  I have made clear that I am fully satisfied that our stakeholders&rsquo; report demonstrates the need for legislative changes in the current policy to address the disproportionate impacts of the TCA on Ireland in the context of the new environmental challenges we are facing.  I have asked him to review the report's findings and recommendations and consider how these can be taken forward to support a fair and balanced CFP.<br\/><br\/>I will now touch on the EU-UK consultations that are a key step in moving forward the quota negotiations for next year.  The bilateral consultations with the UK for 2023 for shared stocks are due to begin at the start of November.  The SIA process and the committee's input today will help to develop Ireland&rsquo;s position during the upcoming negotiations.  The negotiations will be led by the European Commission on behalf of all member states.  I and my team will be fully engaged at EU level to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are recognised and pursued with Commissioner Sinkeviius and his team.  We are hopeful that agreement can be reached in time to allow the outcome to be discussed at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 12 and 13 December 2022 and feed into the TAC and quotas regulation for 2023.<br\/><br\/>I will insist that the Hague preferences are applied at the December council for the relevant fish stocks.  However, if an EU-UK agreement is not secured, a contingency plan is in place to ensure fishing can continue at the start of 2023 without interruption.  Under the Trade and Co-operation Agreement, in the event that agreement with the UK cannot be reached by 20 December, the TCA provides for each party to set provisional TACs applying from 1 January at the scientific level advised by ICES.  In previous years, the Commission developed a plan for provisional TACs for the first three months of the year.  This saw TACs for most stocks set at 25% of the previous year&rsquo;s TAC level, with the full TAC applied for coastal state stocks such as mackerel and blue whiting, which are seasonal, at the start of the year.  While this situation is not ideal, it will provides certainty and continuity for the fishing industry in the New Year, if needed.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to management arrangements for three migratory species in the north east Atlantic in which we have an interest.  They are blue whiting, atlanto-scandian herring and mackerel.  The arrangements for these are negotiated by means of a coastal states framework between the parties in whose waters significant concentrations of these stocks are to be found and that have normally had a track record in fishing them.  The coastal states negotiations for 2023 commenced last week in London.  Agreement was reached on setting the TACs for atlanto-scandian herring at 511,000 tonnes.  The EU, and Ireland, have a relatively small share of this stock.  It is also likely that the coastal states will agree on setting the TAC for mackerel at 782,000 tonnes in line with the ICES advice, although this has not been finalised yet.<br\/><br\/>The ICES advice is based on the FMSY approach and represents a reduction of 2% compared to last year's TAC.  The TAC for blue whiting has not yet been agreed.  ICES calls for an 81% increase but the coastal states are continuing discussions as there is divergence of opinion as to whether all the increase should be applied.  The 2014 sharing arrangement for mackerel between the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands expired at the end of 2020.  Discussions aimed at reaching a new agreement on a new sharing arrangement for mackerel began earlier this year and are ongoing.  I have been clear on the need to agree a sharing arrangement for mackerel that respects the EU and, in turn, Ireland&rsquo;s proper share of the global TAC.<br\/><br\/>We continue to oppose the setting of unacceptably high unilateral quotas for mackerel by a number of third countries.  I have articulated our concerns about what has happened over the past two years, in particular at the EU fisheries Council and directly to Commissioner Sinkeviius.  If this unacceptable behaviour is continued in 2023 by these countries, the EU must work together and use all available tools to ensure real and effective consequences for such behaviour.  The coastal state parties have also committed to begin discussions for new sharing arrangements for atlanto-scandian herring and blue whiting early in 2023.<br\/><br\/>I will move on to the SIA.  In order for the SIA to be carried out, the ICES scientific advice for the stocks was used as a basis for the assessment.  As part of the assessment, an open consultation process was initiated, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the ICES advice for fish stocks for next year; and on the European Commission&rsquo;s communication, Towards more sustainable fishing in the EU: state of play and orientations for 2023. and its accompanying staff working document.  An online web portal at<i><\/i><i><\/i>was activated on 12 October to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  Two submissions to the public consultation were received.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline will be published on the website.  In addition to the written submissions, I convened a meeting of stakeholders including fishing industry representatives and environmental NGOs last week on 20 October.  The purpose of the meeting was to give a further opportunity to representatives to outline their positions on the many aspects of the communication and on the scientific advice.  I thank all the stakeholders for their contributions to the impact assessment.<br\/><br\/>The stakeholders set out a range of positions. However, there were also many commonalities.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed through the consultation process, which, as a whole, I consider to have the same objective of sustainable fishing and the protection of our fishing resource and our marine ecosystem.  There is a clear call for adherence to the advice on setting TACs in accordance with FMSY.  We must also make use of the provisions of the western waters multi-annual plan to deal with stocks where scientific advice indicates the stock is in poor shape.  In recent years, to reduce catches of depleted stocks in mixed fisheries, TACs were set as by-catch only, at levels that help the biomass of these vulnerable stocks to recover to sustainable levels.  These were complemented by remedial technical measures in the Celtic Sea, the west of Scotland and Irish Sea.  The Marine Institute and BIM made invaluable contributions to the assessment of the ICES advice, which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment before the committee today.  I will briefly set out the findings contained in that assessment.<br\/><br\/>From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute&rsquo;s view, which coincides with the ICES view, is that the status of some fish stocks has improved, which is welcome.  However, others remain a concern.  In the impact assessment, the Marine Institute summarises the pressure on the 75 stocks that will be dealt with in the 2022 stock book and compares this assessment with the same evaluation presented in previous years&rsquo; stock books.  The number of stocks being fished in a sustainable manner has increased to 38.  In terms of percentages, this is an increase to 51%.  The percentage of stocks overfished is currently 20%.  The number of stocks with unknown status has decreased to 22 because of increased and improved scientific advice and research.  It is good to see stocks continue on an upwards trend for next year.  It must be remembered that there were only 20 stocks fished in a sustainable manner as recently as 2013 and we now have 38.<\/p><p>There are multiple reasons stocks have unknown status, including short-time series of biological data, conflicting data inputs, low catches or insufficient sampling data, or indeed missing catch information.  Over time, the percentage of stocks with unknown pressure and state indicators has declined.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the sustainability impact assessment, SIA, which will be laid before the D&aacute;il.  For further information, the fish stocks of interest to Ireland are available in the stock book which is prepared annually.  This is a large piece of work by the Marine Institute and is available on its website<\/p><p> Regarding the economic and social impact, BIM has based the socioeconomic assessment on the ICES advice, where available.  In cases where the ICES advice was not yet available or where ICES had provided zero-catch advice for stock, a rollover of last year's TACs was assumed so that the assessment of these stocks could be carried out by BIM.  ICES advice for nephrops, or prawns, as we know them commonly, is expected to be released on 28 October, so we do not have that yet.  In advance of the advice and to assist consideration of the stocks in the Celtic and Irish seas, different scenarios of a 10% reduction, a straightforward rollover, and a 10% increase were examined as this is an important stock for our fishing industry.  It is our second most valuable stock across the sector.  It is important to highlight that the estimates of BIM may change, depending on the final quotas and the total allowable catches agreed between the EU and the UK.  As this advice is for a single stock assessment, we can expect significant changes for stocks in mixed fisheries where a particular stock is depleted.  This is the case, for example, for cod stocks around the coast, and the total allowable catches for commercial stocks for cod as a by-catch will be set to support the protection and rebuilding of the depleted stocks.<\/p><p> If the TACs were to be agreed on the basis of the assumptions I have mentioned, we would see a net increase in fishing opportunity of 2% by volume in tonnes but a reduction of 6% in value.  This amounts to a direct income reduction of &euro;13 million.  For the demersal whitefish sector, this would mean a reduction of 12% in volume of fishing activity and a reduction of 6% by value, with a direct income loss of &euro;6.2 million.  For the pelagic sector, this would result in a reduction of 5% by volume and 7% by value, with a direct income reduction of &euro;6.9 million.  This is primarily due to the decrease in horse mackerel where ICES provided zero-catch advice for next year.  This would, however, be partially offset by following the significant increase in the advice for blue whiting, which has a recommended increase of 81%.<\/p><p> In addition to the direct losses to the fleet of quota reductions, income would also be lost from the processing sector as a result of reduced catches and in a number of ancillary industries such as net making, chandlery, engineering and refrigeration.  This would obviously have a knock-on effect for employment.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara further estimates, on the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, that if the TACs were set in accordance with the single stock advice, it could impact 400 full-time and part-time jobs.  This could occur either through reduced incomes or partial layoffs or redundancies in the seafood sector.<\/p><p> The Hague Preferences, which are the additional amounts of quota that Ireland can claim for important whitefish stocks when the TACs fall below set levels, are negotiated annually at the Fisheries Council in December.  They cannot be taken for granted.  Many member states often strenuously object to the application of the additional quota for Ireland.  Ensuring the preferences are applied will be a key political priority for my Department at the December meeting.<\/p><p> The sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment we are discussing here today provides a good picture of the state of stock and possible implications for 2023.  I thank and acknowledge those who contributed to the production of the impact assessment.  While the assessment is based on the ICES advice rather than TACs proposed by the European Commission, it does highlight the potential for significant impacts on the Irish fishing industry.  There are some stocks where ICES has issued-zero-catch advice.  However, with the implementation of the landing obligation and the requirement to land all catches, including by-catches from such stocks, this would lead to choke situations in mixed fisheries.  The EU and the UK previously established specific TACs for by-catches for these stocks to avoid fisheries being choked.  This highlights the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery and a maximum sustainable yield, MSY, fishery at the same time, so it is challenging.  We need to strike a balance between the potential for severe socioeconomic impacts and the need to achieve good environmental status for the stock.  I would be supportive of a similar approach as was taken in previous years for these depleted stocks.<\/p><p> I look forward to hearing and answering any questions members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#B00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>My questions are based on the Minister's opening statement.  He said these past few years have been particularly challenging for our fishing industry.  In addition to the continuing fuel crisis, the impacts of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and the quota transfers under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement are still having a very negative effect.  These are the Minister's words but what has the Government done to provide our fishermen with a fuel subsidy?  The French and the Spanish fishermen have received fuel subsidies from their governments.  Why has this Government stood back and not done the same for our fishermen?  This Government has given away to foreign fleets the rights of our fishermen to fish in Irish waters.  You would think the Minister and the extremist Green Party would at least have given a fuel subsidy to our fishermen.<\/p> <p>  I was at the recent Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation AGM.  It was good hear the head of the organisation, Pat Murphy, put his case.  The members are the people at sea.  They know exactly what is going on.  They ask about things like the recent announcement giving some people a bit of help with their energy bills, whether it is businesses or ordinary individuals.  Fishermen also have energy bills.  Was there anything in the budget for them?  Recently I was speaking on the Finance Bill and I asked the Minister the same question in relation to fishing.  What was the delivery for fishing in the budget?  I see zilch.  Fishermen have severe energy costs and they are asking me anything can be done about these costs.  The Spanish and the French are getting a subsidy so why are the Irish not getting it?  All we get is the decommissioning and the tie-up schemes.  I was totally opposed to them, as was the Irish south west organisation, but still, unfortunately, fishermen in south-west Cork and other areas are saying it is the only way out now of a sad situation.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said the waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU, that we have a duty of care and a national self-interest to protect their biological riches and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  That is great, but where in the world does it make sense to give away our fishing rights to foreign fleets?  The Minister may say it is so, that  we must be responsible etc., but where does it make any sense that a boat fishing out of Castletownbere or Union Hall or Killybegs should be tied up at the pier while foreign counterparts can fish away to their hearts' content in some of our waters?  It is no wonder fishermen are very frustrated.  I attended that AGM and there is a sense of massive frustration.  I was the only elected political figure who attended it but it would be educational for any politician to attend the AGM because each year they find the hill is getting harder to climb.  This is nothing personal, even if it always seems like it is, but the Minister got a poisoned chalice with this.  It is what it is, however, and we have been led down this road.  The fishermen are angry and the Minister and the Department need to stand up and fight for our fishermen.  This is why they were elected and we were elected: to get the fishermen a fuel subsidy and improved quotas.  It is an absolute disgrace what has happened to this industry.  It was one of the finest indigenous industries in this country and this Government and the Department officials have driven it to the shore with no prospects of a future for many.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister again try to get some of our quota back and provide a fuel subsidy to the industry?  We welcome the proposed 81% increase and I sincerely hope it will happen.  Decisions have to be made around that increase in blue whiting.  However, this will only benefit a club of 23 vessels in our fleet under the current application of the policy.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's opening statement also says that the waters around Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the E.U.  It also says that we have a duty of care and a national self-interest to protect their biological riches and as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  That is great but where in the world does it make sense to give away our fishing rights to foreign fleets?  One can say we must be responsible but where does it make any sense that a boat fishing out of Castletownbeare or Union Hall or Killybegs should be tied up at the pier while their foreign counterparts can fish away to their hearts' content in our waters?  It is not wonder that fishermen are very frustrated.  There was a sense of massive frustration at that AGM that I attended.  As the only elected political figure that attended it.  I think it would be educational for any politician to attend because each year they find that the hill is getting harder to climb.  It seems like it always is but this is nothing personal.  I think the Minister got a poisoned chalice with his appointment.  However, it is what it is and we have been led down this road.  Deputy McConalogue is the Minister and the fishermen are in agreement that the Department needs to stand up and fight for our fishermen.  This is why we were elected, to go out there and get them a fuel subsidy, try to improve our quotas.  It is an absolute disgrace what has happened to this industry.  One of the finest indigenous industries in this country and this Government and the Department officials have driven it to the shore with no prospects of a future for many.  My questions are my repeat statement over and over again.  Will you try and get some of our quota back and again, as per my question, will the Minister and the Government provide a fuel subsidy.<\/p><p>Will the Minister revise the policy so those other pelagic vessels that lose their scad mackerel fishery will get a fair share of this national fishery?  As I mentioned, the scad mackerel stock is estimated to have 805,000 tonnes of live fish.  Knowing this species lives to a good age and there are good results from the egg survey two years ago, surely we can agree to adopt the rebuilding plan accepted by ICES to be precautionary.  I am sure the Minister knows I am not going to end my contribution without once again asking why are we not approaching the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, ICCAT, for a small bluefin tuna quota?  If you want to know why cod and herring stocks are so low I think the sea is full of these fish.  It could be a significant contribution in their eating of this fish, flattening here to be caught by everyone but us.  Even the Japanese fleet lands in to Killybegs when coming to catch them.  I know they also do it in international waters but the bluefin tuna are only a mile from our shore and we cannot catch them.  I would appreciate if the Minister might answer some of those questions. Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#D00200","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael Collins.  First, on the fuel subsidy, the Deputy pointed out that in my opening statement, I outlined the real challenges we have had over the past couple of years.  Biggest of all has been the Brexit challenge and the impact that has had on quota.  Of course, we fought in every way we could to try to protect the sector from any impact.  Unfortunately it was not possible to protect it fully, given that in terms of full outcome of the trade and co-operation agreement, a no-deal scenario would have been really damaging for the fishing sector.  We know that because we discussed it here on many occasions.  One third of the fish we catch is caught in British waters and access to those waters was really important, so it was really difficult.  That has been a challenge and one we have worked hard with our fishers to deal with.  Since the start of the year, as with many other sectors of society, we have had the fuel challenge emerging from the illegal invasion of Ukraine.  That led to an immediate spike in fuel for fishing vessels.  Marine gas oil is different from a lot of other fuel, in that there is no Revenue tax applied to it and the VAT is reclaimable.  There is no capacity to reduce the Revenue tax because it is not there.  It spiked from around 60 cent per litre before the invasion to more than &euro;1 per litre very quickly afterwards.  It has gone up and down since then.  Shortly after the illegal invasion, I met the fishers at their request to discuss that challenge.  All of the fisher representatives coming together made the request to me for a second-month tie-up scheme to try to address and help with the impact on fuel.  The sea-fisheries task force, which I set up last year, had recommended that this year, there would be a one-month tie-up available to every boat and that was in play.  I had that progressing but they asked for a second month, specifically because of the real challenges the fleet was experiencing from fuel.  I moved and delivered that, and implemented it.  That meant an extra &euro;12 million to the whitefish sector.  When you look at that in terms of the financial allocation to our fleet, it is similar to the financial allocation France and Spain have applied to their fleets.  That has been in place since June and is running until the end of November.  I stepped in and delivered that much-needed &euro;12 million to support the sector.  The sector has been requesting that I do something on top of that measure, similar to what France and Spain have done.  However, I have been assessing how the measure put in place has been working.  Other member states did not do that.  They took a different approach but with a similar level of investment relative to the size of their fleets.  That runs until the end of November.  We have seen a spike in the past couple of weeks.  It has gone down again in the last week but it spiked to over &euro;1 in terms of the international benchmark between a week and two weeks ago.  It has come back down to the mid to high 80s in the last few days.  That is the international benchmark price.  It would be higher than that in terms of the actual pump price for vessels because of transport etc.  I am assessing the situation again in light of that and looking at the challenges because I am keen on ensuring that we have appropriate supports in place for our fishing sector.<\/p> <p>  Some have indicated there is a fund available at European level that I am simply leaving behind by not applying such an additional support scheme.  However, what the European Commission has done is provide flexibility for member states to use some of their unspent or future European Maritime and Fisheries Fund money to pay out in terms of reduced fuel costs.  It is not that there is a separate fund.  It would mean using funding that is allocated and earmarked for the industry and investment in the industry.  It would mean using that instead as a direct upfront payment to deal with the pressures at the moment.  I have never ruled that out.  I have said that I have been continuing to monitor the situation and continuing to monitor the impact of the &euro;12 million that I have already put in place.  I am looking at that afresh because none of us know where we are going with fuel.  We had all hoped it would taper off and reduce but that has not been the case and prices have spiked again.  I am looking at and assessing that afresh again.<\/p> <p>   The Deputy also indicated there that this Government has given away the right to fish, to foreign governments.  That is not something this Government has done.  As he is aware, there has been a Common Fisheries Policy established since the early 1980s, whereby the percentage share each country has of various fish stocks was set and allocated.  The percentages were based on the amount of catching different countries were doing at that time.  Some countries got higher percentages of stocks, some countries got lower percentages, based on how much they were fishing at that time.  That was in the early 1980s.  That was done as a management tool to manage the waters generally, because as we know whenever you do not manage waters or manage stocks, they get depleted and they get fished out.  It was set in the early 1980s and despite many reviews and many tugs of war at European level since, that overall allocation key for various stocks between countries has stayed the same.  In order to change it at European level you have to get a qualified majority vote at a European Council meeting.  The one big impact to that allocation key has been Brexit, because the UK has left.  That has disrupted the allocation key in a way that has been unfair to us.  That is something I am looking to get addressed and I am raising it at each and every Council meeting and every engagement I have with my colleagues.  The point I am making is that it should be addressed in terms of the Common Fisheries Policy review that is to conclude over the next number of months.  The unfair burden we have should be addressed as part of that.  It is a system that has been in place since the early 1980s so it is not something this Government has done.  In fact everything I have done as Minister has been to try to improve our fisheries situation and to try and get more quota for our fleet.  I have been battling for that and have voted against many things at European level in order to assert and follow that objective.<\/p> <p>   The Deputy has also mentioned the decommissioning scheme, which he says he and the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation oppose.  The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, along with every other fishing representative organisation, would have been part of the sea-fisheries task force group, which I set up.  Post Brexit and its massive impact on our fisheries, I brought all of the fishing voices to advise me on how I could best support the sector and how we could respond to that challenge.  They unanimously put forward their task force report to me.<\/p><p>One of their asks was a decommissioning scheme to address the size of the fleet to make sure their boats were economic and viable.  That was their request and all the fisheries organisations unanimously signed up to that.  It is not a situation that any of us want to be in.  I wish I could bring about a situation where we gather more quota and, as I said, I am trying to do that all of the time.  All of us, both politically and the fishery representatives, know we have to deal with the situation as it currently stands and as we try to change it.  As I have said, one of their recommendations was a decommissioning scheme.  That is why I have come forward and followed through in relation to their request to me.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Collins mentioned boats being tied up while foreign boats fish.  The request was that I do a tie-up scheme.  The task force asked me for that, that is, all of the fishing representatives I brought together.  They asked for a one month tie-up scheme for 2022.  They subsequently asked for a second month tie-up scheme to respond to the fuel challenge, which I addressed earlier on.  The way a tie-up scheme works is that one out of every three boats ties up in any given month.  It does not change the level of quota we have.  We still fish our full quota.  It is not that other countries are in fishing our national quota.  Our national quota still gets fully fished but it means that instead of there being three boats out fishing the quota, there are two boats out fishing the same quota.  One boat ties up at the pier side and that boat gets paid to tie-up at the pier side.  It gets paid the equivalent of what it would have made if it had been out fishing.  That means that the two boats that are still out fishing have in theory an extra 50% fish to catch to make their trips to sea more viable.  That is how the tie-up works.  One boat ties up and instead of three boats going to sea, two go to sea.  They catch the same quota the three would have caught and, therefore, they are catching extra fish.  It is about making them more economically viable.  I was asked to do that.  It is not that others are fishing our fish because the boats out fishing, which are not tied up, are catching the full quota.  It is not that others are catching the fish and we are leaving the fish behind.<\/p><p> On the issue of the scad mackerel, Deputy Michael Collins asked for a reallocation between boats.  That is always challenging and contested between various sectors of the fleet.  Within the fleet everyone wants more quota.  They want a reallocation of it that leaves individual boats with more quota so while they will always those be in favour of that, there will be as many against it.  <\/p><p> As regards the EU negotiations for bluefin tuna, they are conducted by the European Commission with International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, ICAT.   I do not negotiate directly with ICAT as that is something the European Commission does on behalf of all member states.  It is something I have raised at Council meetings but because it is a fish we did not traditionally have, achieving a quota is very difficult.  However, it is something that I continuously try to make progress on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#E00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Okay.

For example, mackerel spawns off the south-west coast of Ireland, travels all the way north to Norway and then travels back.  Therefore, it goes through lots of different member states' waters so they all have to come together to agree how it is fished, if it is to be fished sustainably.  They all have to agree but they have not been agreeing.  Some have been basically putting their arm in and trying to set their own total allowable catch, TAC.

It comes from the north coast of Spain, up to Norway, then to UK, Faroese, Icelandic and international waters and a little bit over to Greenland.  A huge area is covered.  We catch 24% of our mackerel in our own 200 mile zone and we catch the rest of it in UK waters, so we fish internationally.  As the Minister said, it does a big migration from spawning in the south-west of Ireland up over all of those areas in a feeding migration.  It hibernates in Norway at the bottom of the fjords in the middle of winter and then migrates back down again.  It is fished all along the migration route.<\/p> <p>  To manage this, countries in whose waters this happens have a duty to co-operate under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  However, it is only a duty to seek to co-operate.  We had an agreement governing mackerel between most of the parties from 2014 to 2020.  Iceland was not a party to that but there was an amount set aside for Iceland, Greenland and Russia.  That agreement came to an end in 2020 and coincided with the UK leaving the EU and no agreement has been capable of being put in place for the last couple of years.  Norway then set a unilateral total allowable catch, TAC, increasing it by 55%.  The Faroe Islands followed suit.  The EU and UK stayed with their share of the advised global TAC.  The result of all that is that the amount of fishing has substantially exceeded what is the scientifically advised amount of catch each year.  The concern is that the stock will react to that and we will see a downturn in the stock this year.  Our TAC is advised at minus 2% and if fishing remains at its current high levels, we are going to see much more significant reductions.<\/p> <p>  These are all sovereign countries, so they have to agree to a deal as sovereign parties.  There is no mechanism to force a deal.  The negotiations have started to try to get a new sharing arrangement in place.

The information that leads into the assessment of a stock contains not only the Irish data from the Irish catches but also that from the French and Spanish and the UK, for that matter.  In the case of the international stocks, it also contains the catch and survey data from other international parties such as Russia, Norway and Iceland.  It is a large international collaborative effort that is used to do that assessment.  One of the things that has impacted some, although not all, of the assessments in the past two years is Covid and the ability to be able to get sampling data from vessels.  One of the factors was that we put in a mechanism to get the fishing industry to collaborate with us to do self sampling, and Ireland coped very well in this regard.  They were bringing samples of the catches ashore so that we could biologically assess them but some other countries did not have that scheme in place and, therefore, the data became poorer during Covid.  It was during the Covid period, when the data got poorer, that impacted the assessments that are now coming through.  That is one reason some of the assessments have got poorer recently.  That should be rectified in time.  An international sampling agreement is in place in the EU called the data collection framework.  All European countries participate in that.  Everyone puts their shoulder to the wheel to collect the data and put it through into the assessment.  That short-term situation around Covid should be ameliorated.  In the longer term, there are always stocks for which there is simply insufficient information.  These are stocks that are caught as a by-catch.  The information on those is not good enough to do the assessments from which we give figures for maximum sustainable yield, MSY, for example.  Those stocks are assessed and advice is given on the precautionary approach.  Sometimes the MSY stocks status would be unknown but in relation to the precautionary approach, a precautionary advice would be given to manage those stocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Last year, the Minister said that if tax was set in accordance with the single stock advice it would impact on 248 jobs, full time and part time.

Yet Belgium&rsquo;s fish processing sector had a turnover of &euro;961m in 2019 compared to just &euro;622m for Ireland,&rdquo;he says, drawing figures from Eurostat.  Germany has a coastline of 2389km, [that is substantially less than Ireland] yet in 2019 their fish processing sector turnover was &euro;2,196m.  [That is multiples of Ireland]  Furthermore, over the last eight years, the Irish industry has fallen from 3rd highest in Europe to 10th place.  The decommissioning scheme will reduce the whitefish fleet to a third of its 2006 size. <\/blockquote><p>That is the scale of the scandal of allocation of resources to our own fleet in some of the richest fishing grounds in Europe.  When one looks at the comparison in respect of coastline and the scale of the resources versus the return, and the devastating impact it is having, can you imagine the number of jobs that have been lost to coastal communities because of this repeated failure to get justice?  <br\/><br\/>In the Minister&rsquo;s presentation today, even the Hague preferences are not certain.  I will proceed now with my questions.<br\/><br\/>In the second paragraph of his opening statement, the Minister stated, &ldquo;In addition to the continuing fuel crisis&rdquo;.  At the outset, the Minister acknowledged the impact of the fuel crisis on our fleet, yet we are an outlier in Europe in respect of introducing an emergency fuel subsidy.  Obviously, I will question the Minister in the D&aacute;il Chamber on this point and we will have a more substantial interaction in a little while there, but I am completely shocked.  I understood a number of days ago that there was an expectation in the industry that something would be announced given the scale of this.  I was speaking to inshore fishermen from different parts around the coast again in recent days and this is a real crisis.  The tie-up scheme is entirely separate.  That is a Brexit adjustment reserve fund matter to compensate for the loss of quota and is an unrelated matter.  We are talking here about the impact of the fuel crisis and the failure of our Government, an outlier in Europe, where resources are available and states are being actively encouraged by the European Commission to do something, and nothing is being done.  I trust, now that the Minister has highlighted this issue in the second paragraph of his opening statement, that there will be action on that and perhaps we will receive a response to that in a moment.  I have three questions and then afterwards I will have a final three questions to ask, with the leave of the Chairperson.<br\/><br\/>My second question is on the Common Fisheries Policy.  The Minister proposed to extend our exclusive zone to 20 miles.  Can the Minister give the committee an update as to why that has not been accepted and where it all stands at the moment?  This is of particular importance to a number of sectors.<br\/><br\/>As I have said, I have a number of other questions to wrap up when I hear the Minister&rsquo;s response, but my third question relates to the EU-UK consultations.  On these, the Minister talks about the sequencing and the involvement of the industry, which I welcome.  The Minister wants to get to the point where by the time there is a EU-UK approach to that, the input of the industry can be maximised into that, and getting the feedback based upon the scientific data.  The one thing that is missing and that stand out like a sore thumb is Rockall.  What has happened here is completely outrageous.  As the Irish Government has stated, this is an uninhabited rock.  You cannot put an exclusive limit around an uninhabited rock.  I want to receive some assurance from the Minister today that in those negotiations, he will assert the traditional fishing rights of our industry.  As the Minister knows, from Greencastle, Killybegs and down to Castletownbere, this has cost over &euro;7 million per year.  This is completely outrageous.<br\/><br\/>My criticism is that in the middle of this process of negotiations with the British Government, the Irish Government made something that had been unconstitutional constitutional by ratifying the 2013 agreement by way of incorporating it in the Maritime Jurisdiction Act  That was a significant mistake because, as the Minister is aware from the Barlow Supreme Court judgment in regard to the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement, while an agreement may have been made at government-to-government level, unless such an agreement is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, it does not have a constitutional footing.  We allowed a situation where we confirmed in our law, in line with our Constitution, that by passing that Bill in the Oireachtas, we conceded that territory.  Even though we did that, which was a huge mistake, we should still have access into those grounds under the justice of reciprocity.  There can be no justification for Britain putting an exclusive zone around an uninhabited island.  It has no basis for that under international law.  It would be repudiated by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, for example.  <br\/><br\/>I want to know, therefore, what is happening in respect of Rockall and will it form a robust part of these negotiations when our Government engages with the British Government?  I know that this is EU to British Government level, but will our Government insist that the EU asserts the right of our fishermen in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#G01000","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for his questions.

That position had remained constant since then until the impact of Brexit.  If one looks at what we catch in our waters, in value terms, we catch &euro;128 million of the fish caught in our waters.  Non-Irish boats catch &euro;254 million value of fish in our waters.  We then catch &euro;122 million worth of fish in non-Irish waters, that is, outside of Irish waters altogether.

If one then looks at it in respect of the volume of tonnage, it is much more disjointed and imbalanced, primarily because of the impact of blue whiting, because 70% of the total volume of fish caught in our waters is blue whiting, that is, not looking at it from a value point of view.<\/p> <p>  Again, the challenge here goes back to the early 1980s and to what various countries were catching at that time.  That percentage of the pie was set then.  If one then looks at how that has evolved and if one takes Greencastle, for example, my own and the Deputy&rsquo;s own port, this port will still catch as much fish now as it would have 20 or 30 plus years ago but there is a much smaller number of boats catching this fish.  If one had walked the pier in Greencastle 20 to 30 years ago it would have been very busy with a great many smaller boats with many more people fishing from it, whereas now it is a smaller number of larger boats that are making the catch but a similar level of fish to what was being caught, compared to whenever the pier seemed a great deal busier because of the number of people who had been employed then and the size of the boats.  The overall catch allocation and value has remained consistent, Brexit aside, and we in government and I have been consistently trying to ensure that the impact of Brexit, and in particular the fact that we are the country that is most impacted by that event, should be addressed at European level.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the Hague preferences not being certain, that has been the case ever since the Hague preferences were put in place.  These have to be agreed at each EU December meeting of the Council.  This is often resisted but has always been applied and, likewise, it is something that I will seek to ensure happens again.<\/p> <p>  On the question of Ireland being an outlier in respect of an emergency fuel subsidy, as I explained in detail earlier on, the sea-fisheries task force report recommended a one-month tie-up for every boat for this year.  As the Deputy knows, the seafood task force I put together had all of the fishing representatives involved.  That is what their report asked for, that is, one month for 2022.<\/p> <p>  After the invasion of Ukraine and the impact on fuel, the fishing representatives sought to meet with me again and asked for a second month&rsquo;s tie-up scheme specifically to address the fuel challenges there because of that new impact.  That second month has delivered &euro;12 million into the sector and is similar to the investment that would have been made by France or Spain into its fuel subsidies.  I have never ruled out the fact that I would step in to take further action and I have been monitoring the situation very closely.<\/p><p>The funding in the EMFF is still there.  It is earmarked for other purposes but I can still step in and spend that now.  It is an investment into the sector and will be for other things within the sector.  However, Europe has allowed for the facility to spend that now as a cash payment to support the fleet.<\/p><p> We had hoped that the fuel situation would be more short lived and that it would dissipate.  Over the last few weeks, it had come down somewhat, but it has spiked again.  We have seen that.  I am reassessing the situation and I am also very much bearing in mind that the tie-up scheme, which has been in place since June, is due to run out at the end of November.  I am considering that and I am looking at it afresh.  <\/p><p> We have responded to it, to be fair.  That has been clear.  It was a response that was sought from me by the fishing representatives, and I responded to that promptly.  That often does not get mentioned in the discussion.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn never mentions it and he disputes it as well, but that is the position.  The funding that was invested through that has been similar to what France and Spain have done, for example.  <\/p><p> In terms of the 20 mile review, at the moment, under the Common Fisheries Policy, which was established in the early 1980s, we have exclusive access to our 10 mile zone.  Other countries, depending on historical fishing activity, have had some access in some parts to our 10 mile to 20 mile zone.  I saw it as part of the Common Fisheries Policy review access arrangements to gain complete access and control of our 20 mile zone.  That is something that I pushed hard for at European level.  I travelled specifically to Paris to meet with the French Minister for the marine, Annick Girardin, to press this.  I met with many other member states at EU level as well.  However, I was the only fishing Minister in Europe who was seeking to change that.  There was not support from any other Minister who was seeking to access arrangements anywhere.  I was seeking to change that.  As with most things at European Council level, it requires a qualified majority vote to bring about change.  That was not achieved, and I voted against the proposal to move on without delivering that.  That then went to the EU Parliament, where it was discussed because all three of the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament have to agree on the approach.  The renewal of the access arrangements under the Common Fisheries Policy has to be completed by the end of this year because if it is not agreed by the end of this year, the default position would be that every member state would have access to the shoreline of every other member state.  Therefore, it had to be dealt with by the end of the year.  I sought as part of that to try to push ours out a bit further, but that was not successful.  At a European Parliament level, there was not the support to qualify for majority support there for it, either.  The outcome of that is that it will be reviewed in three or four years&rsquo; time, but it is to be renewed now before the end of this year.  <\/p><p> In relation to Rockall, as the Deputy knows, Rockall has always been in British waters, but we dispute the right of Britain to an exclusive 10 mile zone around Rockall.  The right to a zone is defined under international law, but we have recognised their right to any 10 mile zone around it or their right to any sovereignty of the rock of Rockall.  However, it has always been in British waters.  That agreement to which the Deputy referred in 2013 did not change that.  Rockall was always in British waters even prior to that.  The dispute that we have with them, and what we have totally dispute, is that they have any right to that exclusive, 10 mile access zone around Rockall.  We have never agreed to that, and we still hold that position strongly.<\/p><p> What happened when Britain left the European Union is that Rockall is now part of British waters and not part of European waters, while it was all part of European waters previously.  British waters, our waters and all other waters were European waters.  Now there are European waters and British waters.  Because Rockall is and always was located in British waters, it is now within its water.  There is now a licencing arrangement under the Brexit agreement for European boats, including Irish boats, to be able to access British waters.  That has made the situation more challenging, but we continue to hold a position that there should not be any 10 mile zone.  We are continuing to engage to try to achieve diplomatic progress in relation to that and to assert our historical fishing rights in that area, which is an important fishing ground for boats from Greencastle and from Donegal in particular.  Boats from the south-west coast go to fish there too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#H00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will not speak further about Rockall.  It has been two and a half years and almost three years.  It is an outrageous position that the British Government is taking, and I would ask that it would be dealt with.  It has to be on the agenda as part of these negotiations.  It is extreme bad faith.<\/p> <p>  The next number of questions will address the part of the Minister&rsquo;s presentation that dealt with the coastal states, as well as the difficulty with the non-coastal states.  I particularly refer to this issue around Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland.  The approach that they have taken unilaterally in defiance of the science that we all have to operate within is outrageous.  The concerns are in terms of this 2% reduction in macro.  There are the law abiders who are saying that there would need to be a 2% reduction based on the science.  This is happening in the context of the behaviour by the Norwegians, the Faroese and the Icelandic.  Iceland has built up a huge fishing industry that was not there before.  I want to get a sense of how this has been allowed to continue.  There is a fear that some of the corporations that have invested in these fishing opportunities and companies have too much of an influence at European Commission level.  Some of them are based in the European member states.  How can the Minister stand over asking Irish fisherman to play by the rules as they are based in science - which is fair enough and as he says in his presentation that is what they want to do - while on the other hand tolerating the situation with the Norwegians, Faroese and Icelandic?  This is backed by huge investment from corporations, some of which are based in the European member states and some of which are availing of quota under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Can the Minister make more comments on that?  <\/p> <p>  My final couple of questions relate to the issue of the Hague references.  We asked for what was called burden sharing, and some of the fishing organisations have recently spoken about levelling up, rather than burden sharing.  The Minister might have heard that terminology in his engagement.  This is about a fair share of the impact that comes from Brexit.  That just cannot go away.  The Minister has provided information on landings.  Whatever way he presents the issue of what percentage of the fish we get from our own EEZ, whether this is value versus tonnage and that debate will go on, the fact is that if one looks at the wealth of our seafood sector, which is indisputable, we have gone down the league table.  We have less of a value of a country like Belgium, which has a fraction of our coastline.  We have a fraction of the wealth of the German seafood sector, even though we have a much bigger coastline.  That cannot be stood over.  We can debate back and forth on this.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Chair for his forbearance, my point is that this is a profound injustice.  We are seeing our seafood sector decline.  We are seeing the loss of thousands of potential jobs in coastal community.  I just do not get a sense of anger towards this injustice at an Irish Government level.  That is just the sense that is there.<\/p><p>The Minister has said he pushed for extending the 12 miles to 20 miles and that he was the only voice in there.  At some point there has to be some challenge to the injustice of this.  How is this based on environmental best standards when we have huge corporations investing in member states' quota and being rewarded while our own fleet is decommissioned to one third of what it was in 2006?  I want to get a sense of the outrage of what is happening here and how it could be in line with the more admirable principles of the European Union.  The stated principles are certainly admirable but the actions do not follow.  I see corporations being rewarded that are investing in multiple member states.  Anti-environmental practices are being rewarded.  It is very hard to ask Irish fishing communities to step up when they do not see the same rules being applied either within the European member states or outside.  We are partners with Norway, Faroe Islands and Iceland.  These are strategic partners and we are tolerating this type of behaviour and abuse.  I just do not feel the outrage about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#J00200","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>It is not tolerable and it is not being tolerated.

If people do not come together and agree on managing fisheries sustainably there is only one inevitable result, which is the fishery disappearing over time.

Almost all of them have availed of it in the whitefish sector.  As the Senator says, they have found it to have made a positive contribution.  It has made fishing and going to sea more economically viable because it has made more quota available to those who are at sea while those who are tied up for one month are able to avail of an income from the tie-up funding.  The sector's representatives are asking for a further tie-up scheme for the start of next year.<\/p><p>That request has come forward in recent times and it is something I will consider.<\/p><p> The rationale and logic behind the tie-up scheme has been as an interim measure pending the decommissioning scheme.  The objective behind the proposal for the decommissioning scheme is to ensure the boats that fish are viable and make a good income.  The way the decommissioning scheme works is such that if boats decide not to continue, the quota they would have fished is redistributed among the remaining boats.  The quota is still fished, therefore, but fewer boats fish it.  I raised the example earlier of Greencastle, near my home village, where the number of fish being caught is similar to what it would have been 20 or 30 years ago, but the number of boats catching it is a lot lower and the number of fishers who work on catching it is lower because the capacity catch is much higher.  It is no different from my experience growing up on a farm, or from that of the Senator, I am sure, where the machinery was much smaller, and the man hours much longer, to do the same work.<\/p><p> What I and the industry want is a greater quota to make our ports even more viable.  That is a fight and a battle with which we will continue but, as I said, that has not changed since the early 1980s, when the percentage carve-up was decided based on the fishing activity of member states at the time.  While we will continue to fight that battle at European level, the proposal is in place in regard to the decommissioning scheme to ensure that the boats that fish will have a quota that makes it economically viable to do so.  Once the decommissioning scheme comes into place, the idea is that the need for the tie-up scheme will be removed because the boats that fish will have a greater quota to fish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#K01200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I might just follow through on the Minister's logic for a moment.

Indeed, I took a very hard line in relation to the access arrangements as well, which were discussed over the last number of months, as I outlined earlier.  Brexit has had the single biggest sideways impact on the relative stability since it was put in place in the early 1980s.  We sought to avoid any impact in the first place, but throughout the Brexit negotiations and afterwards our position was that if there was to be any impact as a result of it, there should be fair burden sharing.  That is something that member states were generally agreed on in principle.  It is something that was agreed by industry representatives as well, including fishing industry representatives here in Ireland, who worked with their counterparts.  Of course, everyone worked closely together.  I worked closely with our fishing industry representatives and other member states in determining how to tackle the Brexit challenge.

In the early 1970s, a fisherman with an average size fishing boat was deemed to be as well off as a person who owned a farm and it is ironic to think that we have lost most of that.  We all can picture in our minds the fishing fleet that came up the River Liffey and the display they gave across the way from the convention centre, and the organised way they made their request clear to us and to the Minister who was present on that day.  It is sad to think that nothing has improved except decommissioning.  The Government has failed the Irish fishing industry.  In fact, previous Governments have completely and utterly failed the fishing communities in coastal communities.<\/p><p> Behind every boat and vessel was a shop, butcher shop, local restaurant or whatever which all depended on those vessels and their catches.  The spin-off is so important and vital as well as the income for fishermen.  The current situation adversely affects coastal communities on the periphery of the Atlantic Ocean.  We have so many miles and grand places but I will only talk about places in County Kerry.  There are places such as Dingle, Portmagee, Sneem, the Oysterbed Pier, Blackwater, Kilmackillogue, Glounaguillagh, Tuosist and all the way back to Castletownbere.  A lot of fishermen in Kerry use the facilities at Castletownbere.<\/p><p> I liken decomissioning to the eco schemes being offered to farmers to get them out of farming.  I hate the word \"decommissioning\" because I know that once someone decommissions and gets out of an industry then that livelihood is lost and many more livelihoods are lost within the community.<\/p><p> I have listened to what the Minister said about the tie-up policy.  He repeatedly said in his presentation that there is a fund in Europe that has not been touched yet.  I ask the Minister and the Government to go after that fund.  I do not know what they are waiting for because there is a risk that boats and fishing fleets will go out of business with the cost of fuel and everything and, therefore, we need to use that fund now.<\/p><p> I welcome the 81% increase in the TAC for blue whiting but it will only benefit 23 vessels out of the total fleet around the country.  I ask the Minister to revise the policy so others may benefit from this allowance and mackerel fishery as well in order to get a fair share of this national fishery.<\/p><p> I have heard complaints that mackerel is very scarce from Kenmare, out the Kenmare river and out to the mouth of Kenmare Bay.  Who knows anything about that and why is that the case?  I have also got complaints of massive trawlers coming in at different times and sweeping up everything.  No-one knows who they are but they have cleaned out every type of fish.  I have heard that complaint on the side of the county which I represent.  Who knows about that and is the Minister aware of the situation?  I ask because the issue is very serious.  In the past there were people who fished along the bay but caught so much mackerel, even though they caught them a good few miles away, they gave them to the people inside in the bar or on the street.  Those fishermen are not be to found at all this year whatever has happened.  I have been asked several times to find out what is the reason for the changed situation.<\/p><p> It is late at night but I am very interested in discussing Brexit.  I do know that we did not do well out of the Brexit talks and it seems that the French gained.  I do not know whether we had adequate personnel at negotiations to fight the case for us.  I have been told by fishermen that in their hearts they believe that we lost the battle because we did not put up a reasonable and fair fight which is a shame.  These fishermen and our fishing industry have always been an integral part of coastal communities.  The farmer or the farmer's son or family went fishing in order to keep food on the table and we will lose many of these people with the way the thing is going.  Can the Minister do anything more than what has been done?<\/p><p> Long ago my father had a Ferguson tractor that he used to bring a load of rushes of all things into the village of Kilgarvan.  On one occasion a farmer wanted him to drive in between two houses but a load of rushes fell against the gable of the house and the man who had ordered him to come with the load of stuff asked him could he do any better.  To which my father replied, \"Sure I am doing my best\" and the farmer said that his best was not good enough.  I say to the Minister that his best so far has not been good enough.  Therefore, I ask him to do better and not allow the entire fishing fleet to disintegrate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#M03800","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Anything and everything that can be done to support the sector is being done.

It is distributed all the way from the coast of Portugal right the way up to the coast of Norway.  The Marine Institute has looked at this.  A great scientist, Mr. John Molloy, was one of the people who looked back into the historical period, for example, the 1800s, when we saw see the exact same patterns of mackerel appearing and subsequently disappearing, particularly in the coastal area, which was a mystery at that point.  Those are what we call juvenile mackerel, which are small and immature.  Their distribution varies.  They do not just live in a place like we do on a farm or in a house; they follow food.  If there is little enough food available for them, depending on what they are hunting, they move into a different area.  The distribution of mackerel the Deputy sees around the coast is just based on the distribution of food the mackerel are hunting.  That is why they are there sometimes and not there other times.  That can happen from one year to the next.  Just because juvenile mackerel are not present in a bay in one particular year does not mean they are gone from the stock or gone from the bay.  They are just gone from that bay for that year because they are in another bay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The Minister might comment briefly on the big trawlers that are cleaning out everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102500002#O00500","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>A decision was taken and a process put in place approximately three or four years ago by my predecessor, Deputy Creed, with regard to preventing large trawlers from operating inside the six-mile zone.

CAPS was established in 2011.  It was set up by parents of autistic children who saw a gap in services.  In the beginning there were nine members registered with CAPS.  Throughout the years it has continued to grow and expand.  Due to the yearly rise in members and increased workload, it became a company limited by guarantee in 2018.  Today, there are 96 members from 85 families registered with CAPS, and ten of these families registered have multiple autistic children and adults.  Every child has a right to survival and development.  The Government acknowledged this when it signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  However, 20 years since the son of Bernie Nelson, founder of CAPS, was diagnosed with autism, our children are still without vital services.  They are left surviving but developmentally living nowhere near their potential.  How sad is that?  How utterly sad, and for us as parents of these kids, how frustrating and upsetting that they are not where they could be, deserve to be and have the right to be.  There are no services.  Every child has the right to an education.  Education is vital for us all to reach our full potential but without regular occupational and speech and language therapy, how can our children be comfortable in their classrooms?  How can they learn how to cope with the overwhelming or indeed insufficient sensory stimuli at school?  How can they learn how to communicate with their teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, in order that they can concentrate better, understand better, regulate themselves better and ultimately, learn better?  They cannot do it without these therapies, and we as parents have to look on, helplessly, as they struggle day in and day out.<\/p> <p>  Just last week, I had a meeting with Enable Ireland, looking for help.  My eight-year-old daughter is suffering with meltdowns, kicking and bruising her legs and chest.  She cannot communicate the problem and we are both left totally distraught and exhausted.  Since she does not get occupational therapy or speech and language therapy, I wanted help.  I wanted some respite in order that my husband and I could have a break.  I got nothing.  I was advised that because she is in an autism class in a mainstream school, she would not be eligible for respite.  The respite service is only available to those in special schools.  Even then, there is a three-year waiting list for respite in Cavan and Monaghan.  It has gone too far.  Enough is enough.  There are three, four, and even five-year waiting lists for therapy, respite, assistant dogs and everything.  It is just not good enough because, as we hear all too often, early intervention is key.  In Cavan and Monaghan, the only saving grace that autism families have is CAPS.  CAPS is a registered charity that provides a variety of supports to families in County Cavan and surrounding counties.  Some of these services include the Saturday club, which is held weekly for the younger members of the group.  Activities at the Saturday club include music therapy, arts and crafts and other activities such as games and sports.  We have the computer club, which is held weekly on Friday evenings throughout the year for the older members of the group.  We have seasonal camps, which are held during the school holidays at Easter, summer and Hallowe'en.  These camps include trips to play centres, pet farms, trampoline parks, zoos, a chocolate factory and many more locations around the country.  We have monthly social morning events on the first Tuesday of each month in the Teach Oscail family resource centre, County Cavan.  These meetings are open to everyone, not only members of CAPS.  We provide social outings, which include going to the cinema, bowling and restaurants.  The aim of these outings is to improve social skills and integration.  We also provide a range of workshops, training and therapy sessions as and when required.  Previous services have included first aid, meditation, mindfulness, reflexology, parenting programmes, coaching and counselling.  During all CAPS events, all members are accompanied by a volunteer carer.  CAPS is very fortunate to have an amazing team of volunteer carers year on year.  Our volunteers include students from transition year, TY, classes, colleges and those looking to give back to the community.<\/p><p> CAPS is constantly working on the planning, preparation and delivery of projects and initiatives to support its members, their families and volunteer carers.  CAPS constructed a sensory garden that is located beside Cavan County Museum.  This garden is wheelchair accessible and open to everyone.  The aim of the project is to provide a safe environment where individuals of all ages with disabilities can visit and explore their senses without feeling overstimulated by them.  The garden is also beneficial for parents, guardians, carers, siblings and others who do not have disabilities.  In it, they also have a safe place to relax and unwind.  This project was part funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development and Cavan County Council under the CL&Aacute;R scheme and municipal district funding.  Safe and secure spaces like this are greatly lacking throughout the country.  This is the only public sensory garden in the region to date. The CAPS sensory garden was officially opened on 28 April 2022 as part of our Together We Can All Make A Difference autism awareness campaign.<\/p><p> At CAPS we conduct almost all of our work on a fundraising basis, with little Government funding.  We certainly would not be able to provide any of these camps or activities without the ongoing support we get from our fundraising events throughout the year and our volunteers.  Groups like CAPS should be nationwide and should be State-funded via the HSE.  This is because they provide the services that the HSE is failing to provide.  The HSE should be providing effective access to quality occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  It should also provide therapists to regularly visit schools.  In America, studies have been done on babies who have a higher chance of having autism because older siblings who have autism.  These studies are enabling autism traits to be picked up as early as at eight weeks after birth.  That is when early intervention with these children needs to start.  We need such intervention.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for the opportunity to have our voice heard.  We hope that it will take all our work to the next level and that it will work equally as hard, with the goal of having these much-needed supports and services for our autistic community provided and funded by the State.  We, the parents, have been doing the Government's job but we should not have to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeleen Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>DCA Warriors provide support and assistance to more than 33,000 parents who have children with special needs and-or serious illness.  I will address some of the main concerns that are raised by our members on a daily basis.  The first issue relates to the assessment of children under the Disability Act 2005.  It is difficult to overstate the importance of this assessment for parents.  It identifies the needs of the child and sets out what services are required to address those needs. The assessment must be carried out without regard to the cost of or the capacity to provide any service identified in the assessment to meet the needs of the child.  It sets out the gold standard of service requirements.  This allows a family to identify and plan for the needs of the child.<br\/><br\/>The Disability Act 2005 has placed a legal requirement on the HSE to complete assessment reports within a strict timeframe, without any regard to resources.  Put simply, the HSE is not entitled to say that it does not have the necessary resources to complete reports within the six-month time limit.  It is unclear, therefore, why the HSE sees the six-month mandatory time<br\/><br\/>limit as an aspirational timeframe as opposed to a legal obligation.  The question of resources does not apply because the Oireachtas has determined that the HSE must complete reports within six months, without any clause in respect of resources in the Act.  The assessment of need process is extremely important to parents of children with suspected disabilities.  The clear intention behind the legislation is that there should be a comprehensive assessment of a child's health and educational needs.  Unfortunately, assessment reports are almost never completed within the six-month statutory time limit. The data shows that prior to the introduction of preliminary team assessments, 91% of reports were completed outside this time limit.  In 2019, the average time to complete an assessment was 19.8 months.<br\/><br\/>The HSE stated that the preliminary team assessments, PTAs, were introduced to ensure a consistent approach to the applicants for assessment of need.  A consistent approach to assessments is laudable but it was never clear why this consistent approach meant that assessments were going to be reduced to 90 minutes in duration.  If the real objective was consistency of assessments, all that would have been required was that clinicians be directed to follow a certain procedure, in keeping with the legislation.  In truth, it is clear that the PTA was a useful method of clearing a backlog and taking thousands of children from the assessment of need waiting lists to other waiting lists, such as those relating to children&rsquo;s disability network teams or the early intervention and school-age disability teams.  It is not coincidental that the assessment of need waiting list has statutory time limits while the other waiting lists do not.  When DCA Warriors attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health in June 2018, we set out our grave concerns about the PTA process and how it was not in the interests of the child to have more screening processes as an assessment of need.  The High Court struck down the PTA process last April, but only after thousands of children had been given this form of assessment.  The HSE must now redo the assessments carried out under PTA.  It is clear that most children unlucky enough to be assessed under PTA system have yet to receive proper assessment.<br\/><br\/>It is apparent from feedback we receive from parents that when they contact the HSE for advice on the assessment of need process they are being advised by HSE staff that they do not need to apply for assessments of need and that they will receive everything they need from children&rsquo;s disability network teams.  This is a worrying development.  An assessment of<br\/><br\/>need report provides a family with a gold standard statutory report that is enforceable in the courts if necessary.  Further, it guarantees a family that they will receive a service statement that must<i><\/i>be reviewed on an annual basis.  No other report provides such rights to the child.  To direct parents away from an assessment of need report is in the interests of the HSE; it is not in the interests the child.<br\/><br\/>Health and education needs are inextricably linked for children with disabilities.  This is clearly reflected in the Disability Act 2005, which requires a statement of the health and education needs.  However, it is the experience of our members that assessment reports never include a report from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE,  as required under the Disability Act.  It is clear from the Court of Appeal decision in the case of C.M <i>v<\/i>. HSE from October 2021 that the HSE did not believe the NCSE had any role in the assessment of need reports completed for children.  The court held that this was incorrect as a matter of law and that an assessment report should include the assistance from the NCSE, where appropriate.  The question arises, what happens to the thousands of children who had reports completed without any educational input included in them?  The HSE as been on notice for the past 12 months that these reports are defective and unlawful.  It is my understanding that the HSE has not contacted any parent who had a defective report provided to them on the basis it did not include a statement of the educational needs.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Rita Honan, a clinical psychologist, has stated in expert evidence to the High Court that diagnosis is the gateway to treatment and the subsequent reduction of symptoms and increased cognitive and adaptive functioning for the majority of children on the autism spectrum.  Every day this is delayed leads to missed learning opportunities.  While this evidence was not contradicted at the time, it appears that the HSE does not now accept a diagnosis is needed for treatment or services.  This ignores the fact that a diagnosis is generally a requirement in the context of special school placements.<br\/><br\/>It is nearly impossible to advise our members regarding the provision of services for their children because the system is so opaque.  If a child is on a children's disability network team list, it is not clear when they will receive speech and language therapy or occupational therapy or get access to a psychologist.  Even if a date is provided, it is not clear what level of service will be provided, that is, will they receive a block of sessions and, if so, how many?  What happens after they receive a block of therapy?  How long will they have to wait until the next block of services?<br\/><br\/>DCA Warriors often hear complaints from clinicians that they spend too much time assessing children and not enough time providing services.  Respectfully, this misses the point.  The children who apply for assessments need them.  Those assessments need to be done properly.  After children's needs are identified, they need to be given appropriate services in a timely manner.  Assessments of need and the provision of timely services are not mutually exclusive.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that the HSE has the necessary resources to meet all of its obligations under the Disability Act 2005 and to provide the necessary services to children with disabilities in a timely manner. Almost &euro;1 of every &euro;3 collected by the State in taxation, approximately &euro;68 billion annually, is spent by the HSE.  Put another way, the argument is not one of insufficient resources to discharge the duty but of a preference for using the money for other purposes.<\/p><p>The Oireachtas took the highly unusual step of directing the HSE to allocate resources to complete assessments within six months because it was acutely aware that early intervention was the key to the long-term success of the children who needed the assessments.  The HSE knows this too.  It has chosen to allocate the necessary resources elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aisling Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I am the chairperson of Involve Autism, which is a voluntary, parent-led support and advocacy group based in D6 and D6W in south Dublin.  I am joined today by our deputy chair, Alan Power.  We are both parents of autistic children.  We thank the committee and Chair for inviting Involve Autism to speak.<\/p> <p>  Involve Autism was founded in 2018 by a small group of parents of autistic children who came together to campaign for appropriate school placements for their children in D6, D6W and the surrounding areas of D16, D14 and D18.  We now have a large membership and are a voice for autism in our local community.  Our three pillars are support, advocacy and inclusion.  We hold bimonthly support meetings and social activities for our children, and are developing partnerships in the community with groups, clubs, etc., to promote inclusion.  We frequently hear at our support meetings about the difficulties parents experience accessing an appropriate education for their autistic child, plus their fight in relation to accessing services and supports.  We also provide support through our social media platforms and are contacted frequently.<\/p> <p>  The difficulties experienced by parents is a source of great stress, anguish and anxiety that could be lessened if the system provided the support required to meet our children&rsquo;s and families&rsquo; needs.  Involve Autism has found over the past four years that our parents receive little support from the bodies that should be providing it and we are filling the gap in a voluntary capacity.  Our advocacy has focused mainly on addressing the lack of autism classes in our area.  We have also advocated strongly regarding the lack of access to services for our children.<\/p> <p>  I am passionate about health and education as I have worked in both sectors.  Today we will be focusing on our advocacy in relation to the education of our autistic children.  When we started our campaign, only one primary school had an autism class in our area and there was no autism class at second level for a large schoolgoing population.  We were in fact the worst served area in the country.  We were advised at the time that there was no issue in south Dublin.  We have fantastic schools both at primary and second level in D6 and D6W.  We have non-fee-paying and fee-paying schools and schools with different patrons and management bodies.<\/p> <p>  There are autistic children who are well supported in the mainstream setting, but some of our children, despite this support, struggle in mainstream education.  There is a cohort of children who need the extra support of an autism class.  Herein lies the problem.  Our children who needed an autism class were unable to attend schools in the local community with their siblings and peers.  They spent their days being bused past our schools.  This appeared to be an acceptable practice, with parents being advised to apply to schools in other areas that had autism classes, as there was in essence none in our area.<\/p> <p>  Parents trying to find an autism class for their child were handed a list of classes by the NCSE and were applying to up to 30 schools.  Our freedom of information request in 2021 found that &euro;72,000 is spent daily transporting children with additional needs across south Dublin at an annual cost of &euro;11.6 million, demonstrating the lack of historic planning by the NCSE.  We were determined to make meaningful change and embarked upon a significant campaign.  We have led a data-driven campaign, presented our data to several key stakeholders and been relentless.<\/p> <p>  Our campaign continues to be a full-time job, but this is not our job and never should have been.  Our campaign in part led to the commencement of the section 37A process in south Dublin in November 2019.  We were hopeful following this that there would be significant change in our area, but this did not happen.  Unfortunately, some of our well-established schools have been reluctant to set up classes.  Newer schools being set up by Educate Together and DEIS schools nationally opened autism classes.  We have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to get autism classes established and have had to be cognisant that we were in a vulnerable position as our own children were involved.<\/p> <p>  The experience of parents of neurotypical children as they search for a school placement is for the most part seamless.  When you have an autistic child, however, it is a perilous and extremely stressful journey.  Our parents recount stories about having little to no support and a lack of up-to-date information regarding autism classes from the NCSE.  Parents are sent a list of classes and told to search for a class for their child, again with little support.  In our parents&rsquo; experience, searching for an appropriate school placement includes ringing schools listed to be informed that, in many cases, autism classes are full, having to send up-to-date psychological reports to each school applied for, experiencing difficulties with enrolment policies, anxiously waiting to hear if a child has secured a place and having little to no choice, resulting in many children travelling unnecessarily long distances to school.  There are lots of other points to be raised in relation to that.<\/p> <p>  Parents recount stories of difficulties experienced when their child is considered to be in an inappropriate setting and how some children are managed out of schools due to those schools not having appropriate supports for the child.  This leaves parents in a stressful and vulnerable position, with no one to help them advocate for their child and navigate the education system.  At all times we encourage our parents to work in partnership and collaboration with their schools and empower our parents so they have an awareness of their children&rsquo;s rights with reference to education.<\/p> <p>  As part of our campaign, we held two large public meetings, one in February 2020 and one in April 2022, to highlight the issues that our families and families across south Dublin faced in securing an appropriate school placement for their autistic children.  We invited all key stakeholders to both meetings to encourage collaborative change in the educational landscape in the area.  We invited politicians to sign a pledge to ensure classes were set up properly and schools were fully supported in doing so.  We made a formal complaint to the Ombudsman for Children and our concerns are referenced in the Plan for Places report.  We want an excellent, quality education for our children in schools in our local community.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that there has been some progress in our area and that our voices have been heard but we have continued to campaign.  Our partnership approach has led to a lot of progress and positive relationships being formed locally and nationally.  D6 and D6W still have no early intervention class and a number of schools are without autism classes at primary and secondary level.  We very much welcome the announcement by the Spiritan Education Trust in March, and we look forward to further change in the area.<\/p> <p>  At a recent morning support meeting, it was heartening to hear one parent describe how her child is now in a local autism class and what a huge difference that has made to her child&rsquo;s life and her family&rsquo;s life.  We know from speaking to principals the difference it has made to the whole school community to have an autism class in their school.  Our schools need to be fully supported by the NCSE, the Department of Education and the HSE.  To the schools that have established autism classes, we thank you for your commitment to our children and for making such a difference to our children and our families&rsquo; lives.<\/p> <p>  We want the committee to look at the following points.  As Donogh O'Malley stated: \"We will be judged by future generations on what we did for the children of our time.\"  We feel there needs to be accountability to ensure the needs of our autistic children are met by senior political leaders and senior managers in the Departments and Government agencies involved.  We would like a review of the NCSE, especially its operational functions.  We want data-driven strategic planning for our children and not an any-place-will-do approach.  We want a strategic vision regarding to the education of autistic children that is cognisant of Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and that is child-centred.  We want recognition of all educational transition points, preschool, primary school, including junior primary and senior primary, secondary school and post primary school options; a comprehensive plan for the educational pathway for each child; a centralised application process for autism classes, like the Central Applications Office; meaningful support for families; support for schools and allocation of resources required, including wraparound supports; and an advocate to support parents when they have to navigate difficulties with their child&rsquo;s school.<\/p> <p>  We would like an overhaul of the structure and governance of schools' boards of management; an oversight and standardisation of admissions policies for autism classes by the Department of Education to ensure they are non-discriminatory; and comprehensive tracking and support of autistic children who are unable to attend school due to inappropriate school placement, are finding it difficult to attend school or whose educational placement has broken down.  We would like training for teachers, SNAs and all who support our children. We would like full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act; to ensure an inclusive education, as per Article 24 of the UNCRPD; and a diversity and inclusion officer on the board of management of each school.<\/p> <p>  We need to look at international best practice models and at the integration of health and education, for example, the education health and care plan, as in the UK, looking at the child holistically and ensuring that wraparound supports are in place.  We would like our parents to be met with compassion by all they interact with, particularly schools.  Parents are the primary educators of their children and should be encouraged to work in partnership and collaboration with their child&rsquo;s school.  Most of all, we should be and need to be ambitious for our children in order for them to reach their potential and an excellent education is a key enabler of that.  Our children will become adults and deserve a meaningful future.  They need and deserve an education that is excellent and why should we expect any less?<\/p> <p>  We commend our Involve Autism parents plus the parental advocacy groups nationally who have raised their voices in an effort to instigate change.<\/p><p>I also thank all those who have supported Involve Autism Dublin 6 on our campaign to date.

I commend the witnesses and the organisations they represent.  I also commend the many other parents organisations that exist around the country on the work they do.  As the witnesses have pointed out, they should not have to do that work.  The parents' organisations are only there because the services and supports that should be available to them are not available.  I want to especially welcome Ms Smith and Ms Boylan from my area of Cavan and I know the work CAPS has done for the past 20 years, which has been immense.  As CAPS is the longest-formed organisation, has it seen any improvement in the provision of services and school places to meet the needs of autistic children in Cavan and elsewhere in its time?  I know Bernie Nelson, the founder, is not here but I ask our guests about their experiences in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On early intervention, the HSE was with us last week and it told us that an assessment of need, AON, is not required, nor is a diagnosis.  I do not understand that because an assessment of need outlines the services and supports that a child needs.  In an ideal world a diagnosis would not be needed if there were sufficient places for all autistic children in our schools but there are not and schools are depending on the diagnosis in order to allocate the places because there are so few places.  Also, it makes sense that they would know what the needs of the child are.  I invite the witnesses to comment on that if they wish.<\/p> <p>  Ms Byrne mentioned the preliminary team assessments, PTAs, and warned against them and I know that other clinicians warned against them as well.  We see the mess we are in because so many children have received this PTA and it is not a proper assessment and it has just put them on another waiting list.  On schools, I read through Involve Autism Dublin 6's survey and unfortunately I have heard similar stories from other parents.  That was shared with certain organisations but has it been shared it with the NCSE?  If not, would it be worth sharing with it and if so, what comment or response has been received, if any?  Some special education needs organisers, SENOs, I have worked with in the past are excellent while many others do not seem to understand their jobs.  They do not liaise with the children and families who require their support and they almost seem to be the gatekeepers for the Department rather than supporting the family and the child in finding a school place and then in maintaining it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#E00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>In regard to services it is worse than it was.

We spoke about the following matter on the way up in the car.  A lot of funding is being put into autism classes at national school level but when it comes to secondary schools there is nothing in place.  It is quite frightening to think about as my children are in second and fourth class.  The boy in fourth class will be in mainstream education but I have no idea where my daughter in second class will go when she goes to secondary school.

One of the questions we put was if they had any suggestions on how the NCSE could do a better job.  As a parent, the experience with the NCSE has not been one of receiving timely answers or support.  One must look at the job description for a SENO and the reality of what is being executed.  You can say it is because of funding and the NCSE will get extra funding and on the ground maybe people are overwhelmed, which has to be taken on board, but from our point of view you are left to your own devices.  Nobody we have encountered in our group had much support from a SENO, if any.  I am the local unpaid SENO and I have managed, quite successfully, to help people to get classes because I work in education so I understand that.<\/p> <p>  A lot of the time we know what is happening in the area when a SENO does not know.  I will give an example of that.  I was outside of my son's school and one child was looking for an autism class and their parents did not realise that one of the local schools down the road was opening a class.  Why is that?  My understanding of the SENO process is that the SENO is allocated to the school and not the child.  Nobody is following the lifetime or pathway of the child from an educational perspective and that is concerning to me.  It is pot luck as to who gives you that information.  Our experience has been that there is no up-to-date information from the NCSE.  We know a lot about data etc. and we have put that in place ourselves in our campaign but there is no live system for parents to see where there is a place and to determine what they will do.<\/p> <p>  One of the other critical things is that parents are applying and each time they are putting in their psychological reports and all their data.  One must think about the general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues around that and the language that goes with it.  There is no streamlined process.  We have asked for that and I cannot see why we cannot start looking at a streamlined process for applications that reduces distress and allows people to know where the places will be.  We must support the schools in doing that.  It is about supporting the schools to be able to open classes but our parents do not have up-to-date information and I provide a lot of support locally because I happen to work in education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>No AON basically means there is no legal ramification for the HSE.

I would encourage the Department to look over what people have said in the committee today.  Last week it was trying to pull teeth to make the point that it is not working.  The hurtful thing is they were defiant in saying that it is working.<\/p> <p>  We have little to no power.  For me as someone from the Traveller community I would always say there should be nothing about us without us and I cannot speak on behalf of a mother with an autistic child because I am lucky enough not to have an autistic child.

When I first joined this committee, there were discussions about opening special schools.  While we need special schools, we also need special classes and supports to meet children where they are.  Not every child who is autistic needs to attend a special school.  I might have been unclear but this is my point.  In Donegal, as I said at last week's meeting, some parents have to wake their children at 6 a.m. in order that they can travel from one end of the county to another.  What impact does that have on a child's well-being and mental health?<\/p><p> Our guests spoke about the NCSE issuing new guidelines.  If they have anything they might like to add on that, they might do so.  I could ask many questions, but we have only one bite at the cherry with the recommendations that will go into the report, as I have been saying to every group who appears before the committee.  The committee runs for only a few more weeks, so it is important to hear its recommendations to the Department and the HSE.  What needs to be put in place for children, and for parents as well?<\/p><p> I apologise if I was ranting but I want to hear more views and recommendations from our guests as parents using the services, given some people might think it is all hunky-dory when it comes to the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#E00800","speaker":"1657","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>For autistic children, depending on their needs, they can do very well within a mainstream setting as long as they are properly supported, which is important.

There is also special school provision for children who need to be supported in a particular way.<\/p> <p>  Travelling a long distance to school is not an appropriate school placement, and we have spoken to people in education about this.  Anxiety is caused to children when they are put into a taxi or onto a bus for the long term.  We may hear from some parents that their child actually likes that journey but others will say otherwise.  In Dublin traffic, the journey might not be far but it is long because of the nature of that.  Moreover, parents often talk about the difficulty they have in getting transport and so on.  Travelling long distances to school is not appropriate.  When the rest of a community is walking by the parent to the local school and that parent and his or her child are not a part of the community, that is not an appropriate education for the child.<\/p> <p>  The anxiety issue is significant for a number of children.

A lot of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools have come forward, as have many of the Educate Together schools.  There is beginning to be change.  There are some fantastic parental advocacy groups and that is where the classes are now being opened because we have raised our voices.  Why are we not planning for that under the NCSE and whoever else is responsible?  I acknowledge the Minister of State has come forward but, at all times, the planning has not been there to say these children need to be in their local schools and their local community.<\/p> <p>  The benefit to the entire school community is substantial, not least through diversity and inclusion.  Having a sensory room, for example, in a school that would not have had it otherwise benefits the entire school.  Similarly, the benefits of having people who have experience working with children who are autistic or have additional educational needs - it is not all about autistic children - is profound and has a profound effect on the school.  We have talked to principals about how it has changed the dynamic of their schools.  We need to stop segregating our children and they need to be included, yet every child needs the support that is correct for him or her because every child is different, and it is important to say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I might come in on the transport issue.  I am going to contradict my earlier response.  In County Cavan, we are doing well with autism classes in our primary schools, but we keep banging on about how early intervention is the key because that is the case with autism.  Nevertheless, what we are lacking in Cavan and throughout the country is early intervention classes, which are vital.  One child attends an early intervention school in Mullagh, about one hour away from their home town, and they have to take a bus there every day because it is the nearest option.  The school is fantastic and the child has been doing really well, but we need a lot more of these services, especially for children at the age of three or four, before national school.  Sending them off on a bus for an hour at three or four years of age is not right and is hard on the parent.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to national school, it is up to the parent of the autistic child to ring around schools looking for a place, which is not easy.  Every autism class holds only six kids, so it is not easy to find a place and parents must ring around every school years before the child starts school.  I know of one parent who visited a school and there was a little boy asleep at the time in a dark room.  The principal told the parent that the child has a nap every day when he comes in because he gets up so early to travel to school.  In my experience, and that of many parents to whom I have spoken, it seems to be all about funding and the quickest route to school, or using a bus that already passes the school and can pick up the child.  In the case of one little girl who was starting school, Bus &Eacute;ireann agreed that she would be picked up from her house and brought to school, but she would have to wait in the taxi because it was bringing some older kids to a secondary school and she would be too early for her school.  She had to sit in the taxi with a man for 20 minutes before the day started.  This was a child with autism sitting in the back of a taxi for 20 minutes.

We really need to see it a lot sooner.<br\/><br\/>I will address the representatives of the Cavan group because they are my nearest neighbours.  I was really struck by some lines in their written statement which read:<\/p><blockquote>\tEvery child has the right to an education [...]  But without regular occupational and speech and language therapy, how can our children be comfortable in their classroom?  How can they learn how to cope with the overwhelming or indeed insufficient sensory stimuli at school? <\/blockquote><p>Has Cavan Autism Parents Support, CAPS, found resistance from schools?  My view is that there should be special education classes in every school.  Special education has to be visible.  Your peers, your brothers and your sisters have to see it.  It needs to be part of a class.  As a society, we need to go on a journey with special education.  Is CAPS seeing resistance?

That is another big concern for children who have additional educational needs or who are autistic and whose therapies have been removed from their schools.  At all times, what we want and need are children who are ready to learn but they are not ready to learn if they have all of those other things going on.

In mainstream education here, there is really only involvement where there is a crisis situation in the school.  We had a system in special schools that worked very well.  The therapists were on site in the schools.  There was a team of therapists working with the teachers to ensure that any challenges could be addressed immediately so that the class could be set up.  In spite of every stakeholder involved, including the schools, the specialists and the families, asking for it not to be done and even the Minister of State saying it would be paused and not done, this system was changed under the progressing disability services model.  We are now trying to put the genie back in the bottle by getting these therapists back into the schools.  In our special school, the principal is now working with 12 different children's disability network teams, CDNTs, to try to get therapists to support the different children.  How do you unravel that?  The parents have now been allocated to different CDNTs and are now going to lose those teams as we slowly put the therapists back into the schools.

I have a number of questions to address in this committee meeting.  I will start off with Ms Byrne and compliment the work of DCA Warriors.  It is an organisation I come across very often in my line of work.  The advocacy it undertakes and the help it gives to families at very difficult times is very welcome.  I put that on the record.  I hope she will continue the great work she is doing with DCA Warriors.  I read her submission and heard her speak this morning.  Deputy Tully referred to the gold standard, as Ms Byrne has called it, that is, the assessment of need.  At our last meeting with the HSE, we were at pains to ask whether families need an assessment of need and its representatives were at pains to say they do not.  They repeated that three or four times.  Ms Byrne has described that as a very worrying development.  I know she has already spoken to the issue but will she again tell us how it will impact on families to not have that gold standard?  Will she comment on that?<\/p> <p>  I was very taken with Ms Kenny and Mr. Power's organisation's proposal for a centralised application system for school places.  I am dealing with a number of families at the moment.  One of these is on its sixth school in looking for a place.  I also believe a centralised application system needs to be put in place.  This was something we mentioned to the principals' networks.  They spoke about time.  Time is very important in this process as it allows for planning.  The unions also spoke about that.  Will Ms Kenny and Mr. Power again address the issue of a centralised application system and how the current situation is affecting families in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W?  They may also have other comments on that system.<\/p><p>It is something we could definitely get behind as a committee.  When a parent rings you asking you to intervene with principals and saying they are on their sixth school, which is what I have at the moment, it is extremely worrying.  Something needs to be done about it.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p><p> Ms Smith and Ms Boylan are from County Cavan.  I am from a rural location.  At the previous meeting we spoke about regional supports, and the issue was touched on by Ms Smith.  Are other regions or County Cavan missing out on something that other bigger locations, such as Dublin, are getting, where there are a lot more supports?  I know CAPS has looked at that before.  Is there something CAPS has seen, as a community group in a rural area, on which it is missing out?  We have mentioned the transport issue.  Is there something else that is happening?<\/p><p> As the Chair is aware, we have been dealing with summer programme recently.  We have a motion coming before us today on that.  How is that affecting the organisations on the ground?  Are summer programmes being offered in the witnesses' areas?  How beneficial are they to families?  Where they are not being offered or where the witnesses have heard stories of them not being offered, how is it affecting the routine of families?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#G02000","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>As I said, the assessment of need is the only legal avenue left.  We see thousands of families every day who are crying out for services and help.  I watched the previous meeting of the committee.  The fact is Government officials think the CDNTs are working when they are not.  I can speak from personal experience.  I have two children on the autism spectrum, one of whom is 16.  He was assessed 13 years ago.  Even back then, we waited a long time and our assessment of need was outsourced.  In those years my son has had no psychological input.  Everything I have paid for, I have paid for privately.  There are parents crying out that they have had the exact same experience.  They have had no input from the services.  I am very fortunate that I have linked in with the CDNT.  We had our first individual family service plan meeting.  My son's needs and goals were set out, and no review date was given when it should have been.  He had a 15-minute meeting with an occupational therapist who has now left the service and is gone, so we are back to square one.  There are parents who are being attacked daily in their homes by their children.  I am one of those parents.  I have cried out for help and supports and I have got none.  CDNTs are complex.  A child will not fit into one box either.  There are a lot of severe and complex cases.  We know of parents who have been killed by their children.  That is the sad reality.  For Government officials to sit there and say that CDNTs are working, to flare it up and say it is a brilliant service when it is not, is wrong.  It is absolutely not working and we need to do better.  We are at complete crisis point.  I have never seen it as bad, and I have been working in the disability sector for 21 years.

The parents then go around and call dozens of schools, asking if there is a place for their child.  There is no visibility of whether schools have places.  Parents are just given a list and they call all of the schools.  There are thousands of parents making fruitless begging calls.  It is a brutal system in respect of what parents are made do.  There are also GDPR issues in sending around applications to dozens of schools.  That enrolment for schools is open from October to November and the NCSE publishes its list of upcoming available classes in the following April, May or June in itself is ridiculous because enrolment has closed.  The parents have missed the window for applying for the school.  A simple thing the NCSE could do is to publish that list earlier, with clarity on how many places are available in each class for the upcoming year.  It would save the schools a lot of time in fielding all these calls.  The introduction of a centralised system would not be rocket science.  We do it for the CAO.  A secure system could be introduced to prevent any GDPR challenges.  Also, the NCSE would be getting data on where the next child is coming from.  Today, I do not know how it does it.  Deputy Tully mentioned the SENOs.  Some are contactable and some are not.  The NCSE say the SENOs are its eyes on the ground.  Some of them do not pick up the phone because there is nothing they can do for parents because there are no classes in the area.

In the case of an autism class in a mainstream school, it is about integration all the time.  We are trying to encourage integration, even though it might not always be possible for every child.  If everybody takes in junior infants or first years, then more than likely those class places will be gone.  Planning needs to happen in respect of that.  That is something to look at.  The CAO system works.  I work with it all the time.  We need to look at the system.  We do not need to be putting in all the information again.  If there were up-to-date information for parents, it would reduce the stress for them.  Parents are calling schools.

I have reflected on the matter and the reality is that Dublin 6W has large well-established schools and only one school is a fee-paying school.  There has been some change in the provision to do with primary schools but not all of the larger primary schools have opened classes.  Some parents move to the area to go to schools in the areas of Dublin 6W and Dublin 6.  Children come from well outside the area to come to our schools, which means our own local children cannot attend their school.  There are three of us in one estate who should attend a local school but, unfortunately, we cannot.  That is very difficult for us because the whole area goes to that school.  There has been some change and we welcome that but there is much more work to do.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, there has not been the same level of change in Dublin 6.  Again, on reflection, we have different patron bodies in the area and a number of fee-paying schools.  If you look at where classes have been set up historically and if you are looking at Dublin 14, Dublin 16 and Dublin 18, there are fee-paying schools in those areas.  We would feel, and based on our data it will be found, that there are fewer special classes in those areas.  What does that say to the committee?  I am just going to leave that there.<\/p> <p>  We need to keep changing that.  Great progress has been made with the Spiritan Education Trust that runs a number of fee-paying schools and is opening up a special school in the area, which is greatly welcomed.  It will be the first educational trust that will open special classes within its fee-paying schools, which is a huge change.  That is a change on its own behalf and the Spiritans have decided to do that.  I will not list the schools but if members research that, they will find out what those schools are and they will know what I mean by that.  We now need to see the same thing happening in the other schools of different patronage.<\/p> <p>  Children are very well supported in fee-paying schools and people do very much try to meet the needs of the children, but the funding would not be the same.  Also, the funding for special classes in fee-paying schools has not been there historically.  There needs to be change within that to encourage diversity and inclusion within these schools so children of all different needs, disabilities etc. are part of that school environment.<\/p> <p>  We have incredible schools in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W.  The testament to that is parents move to the area and try to ensure their children attend local schools.<\/p> <p>  On dental appointments, I have seen what is being referenced.  If your child is in mainstream education and you apply for the special dental service to do with autistic children, you are told that your child cannot attend that service if he or she is not in a special class.  That happened to us personally as parents.  My husband, who is not here today, rang to ask and spoke very clearly that that is discriminatory.  What the Department is saying is that a child who is autistic, who is in a mainstream environment and not in a specialist school setting cannot access dental appointments for autistic children.  Historically, that is what has happened and I know the parents of Dublin 12 have raised this issue recently.  My husband and I have experienced this as parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>That is unbelievable and not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#J00400","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank the groups for coming in today and for the advocacy work they have done over the past two years on behalf of the parents of autistic children.  There are other groups, like the Dublin 12 Campaign for Inclusion, that have been doing similar work and, as Ms Kenny has stated, have raised issues concerning access to dental care.<\/p> <p>  We, as a committee, can make comparisons.  Today we are having a discussion with parents and advocates and last week we met representatives of the HSE.  It is like we are living in two different countries.  The HSE representatives are living in this amazing country where there is a functional CDNT and kids are getting great therapy, while the parents and advocates are living in a different country with a hugely dysfunctional CDNT with huge vacancy rates.  The way that the HSE described the CDNT model made it sound amazing and textbook perfect.  If I were to write an essay on the CDNT model on that basis, it would sound the best way possible to do it, but clearly the CDNT model is completely dysfunctional and is not working.  I do not know many people who are getting any services, and the parent and advocates present have described that situation as well.  Senator Flynn asked the HSE representatives directly whether they thought the CDNT model was the best model and they said, yes, hand on heart, they absolutely thought the CDNT model was the best model.<\/p> <p>  My contribution related to therapies in schools and I meant all schools, not just special schools.  The HSE representatives came back to say they are working on providing therapists in special schools but fudged the issue on whether the CDNT model would move back into mainstream schools.  A pilot schools inclusion programme took place in Dublin South-Central but it did not seem to take off.  Covid seemed to throw a curveball at that.<\/p> <p>  Why do the delegations think we have high vacancy rates?  If therapists were employed directly by schools or had more direct access to schools where their working day revolved around the school day, do they think that would work?  From speaking to therapists, I think that is something that might appeal to them a little bit more.<\/p> <p>  I have an observation rather than a question about Ms Byrne's contribution, which is that she must keep stating what she said.  As my colleague Senator Wall said, the HSE representatives were so clear to us and pushed so hard that an assessment of needs is not necessary to get services.  We know that is not true because an assessment of needs is necessary to get into any early intervention class, even though they say that is culturally wrong, that the schools have brought that in, and that it is not in law that an assessment of needs is necessary, but we know it is needed.  If anyone is applying, they need an assessment of needs for home tuition and domiciliary care.  That point is very important and I am glad Ms Byrne spelled it out because many people at home will be watching her.  It is very important we reiterate that it is actually very important to get an assessment of needs, and that cannot be allowed to be downplayed.<\/p> <p>  The HSE representatives also mentioned they were in talks about bringing in day respite for families, which I think could work.  Have the witnesses had any interaction with the HSE on talks about day respite services?<\/p> <p>  Ms Kenny and Ms Smith mentioned the issue of secondary school placements.  There have been some improvements in the provision of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes in primary schools.  It seems to be very difficult now for parents to get their children into a secondary school and have an appropriate placement.  It is almost like the Department thinks that autism fades when children reach secondary school.  Do the witnesses have comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#J00500","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>It is just that.  What is going to be done when these kids move on?  Is there any plan in place?  There is a serious lack of secondary school places.  Where I am from in Cavan there is an autism class in Oldcastle, which is not too far from Ballyamesduff.  That is okay for a child in a mainstream class.  In an autism class in a primary school setting, there are high ceilings and so many of the rooms have been designed for these kids.  There seems to be none of that for second level schools.  It is a huge worry that the same effort is not put into the secondary schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeleen Smith"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>There must be a realisation that when a child with autism goes into second level school it can be exceptionally challenging for them, particularly if they have already maybe managed in a mainstream setting.  When they get into secondary school the complexity of trying to manage a very busy school and trying to manage the complexity of movement in and out of different classrooms is excessively stressful.  In one way, the need could be higher in a secondary school.  Some of these children could have managed within the mainstream environment at primary school, but not at second level.  Again, we need to plan.  If we are not planning then these children will go from one school to the next without proper support.  These range from young children who need to be in an early intervention class and who need proper support, then there are children who need support in primary level and then again into secondary school.  We must also consider the universities, which are considering starting to look at autism-friendly universities.  If the child gets that far then we must look at those pathways.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the secondary schools, however, at all times it can be excessively stressful for students within the mainstream setting.  If they had somewhere to go within the school and if they had autism classes in the school, then they can be supported.  Within that, we are talking about sensory rooms, sensory spaces, and access to therapeutic services within the school or within a counselling service.  At all times, parents need to be met with compassion.  By this I mean that the system is trying to support the family to ensure that the child remains in school, and in remaining in school receives access to their education and their potential in the future.  This is something that really needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  In the context of models within that, there are some fantastic educators working in education at second level schools who could be spoken to and who could really have a lot to say and a lot of input to give around what is working.  I am aware there is a school in Kinsale that has seven classes for children with special educational needs.  Some of those classes are for children with autism, and some are for children with moderate learning disability.  That is on-site in the area.  It does work by doing it in different areas.  We really need to start planning for that because all of these children are going to move through a system, and they need support at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>They will also need support when they leave secondary school.

I worked in the health service and it can be a very stressful environment in which to work.  That is the first thing I will say.  The second point is with regard to therapists.  We find that we meet people who are excellent and very much want to do the right job, but they are totally swamped and feel that they are not providing the quality of service they want to provide.  Why would a clinician stay within that if he or she is not providing the service that he or she was trained to do?  I speak to many different friends who are involved in and who work in those areas.  They will tell us that they cannot maintain it.  They are also meeting people and parents who are distressed.  Much of the time, the therapists are the front line and they get the frustrations of the parents.  It is so upsetting for them if a person trained and went in as an occupational therapist or as a speech and language therapist and that person wants to deliver a service and is not able to deliver that.  I have spoken also with people who were involved in senior management within the disability sector and who found it excessively stressful.  Again, this is due to a lack of resources.  Again there is goodwill and they want to do the right job but they cannot do it with what they are given.<\/p> <p>  We need to go back to have a root and branch review of what they are doing.  On paper some of the things like the children's' disability network teams look great but we need people, at all times, to provide a service.

It is like saying to anybody else who has a diagnosis to do with any other disability or anything else \"We are terribly sorry about that, there you go, that is what your need is and we cannot actually meet it.\"  One is not told this in any other situation.  I am not trying to medicalise autism but people are not told this in any other condition or anything else, be it a child or an adult.  We are told, \"We are definitely sorry about that but there you go, this is what your need is and we will see you in about ten years\".  That does not happen in other areas so why should it happen in this area?  We must go back to the expectation piece and the accountability piece: we need to expect much better from our services.<\/p> <p>  I was thinking about the service aspect.  The supplementary information that I sent to the committee was just information that I put together myself.  We have national organisations.  Do they not survey their customers to see what their satisfaction is like? From that, one would develop a service that meets the needs of the individuals that are there.<\/p> <p>  Another point I would like to raise today is that we have had phenomenal support from our politicians.  They do not always get thanks for that but today I would like to make public thanks for that.  We have had incredible support.  In Dublin 6W, we have three different constituencies.  We have had such great support and we just wanted to say this.  Most people want to do the right thing here but we now need to move forward, stop the talking and get some things on paper.  It is so difficult because there are so many things that we would like to say to Deputy Buckley in response to his question.  We must come back and remember that it is about our children.

It does not come as any shock that a lot of the witnesses have autistic children or relatives.  My son is autistic so I have skin in the game, as they say.  We can get into the ins and outs of the assessments of need and the therapies that are not happening but listening to the HSE last week, the one message is that it is not likely to be able to offer the service that is required in the near future.  The foreign recruitment drive and the localised stuff is not going to deliver.  It also looks like we do not have the workforce planning done to have the throughput for even three or four years' time.  That is something that has to be put on the agenda or we will be having this conversation forever.  P&aacute;iric Clerkin of the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, was before this committee recently.  This might relate to some of the stuff Mr. Power said.  Mr. Clerkin suggested a change to the admissions Act so people, particularly those with special needs kids, could apply two years beforehand.  That would give schools an element of organisational time.  Beyond that, if necessary, he said section 37A should be implemented.  We have all heard stories from parents and we all know the situation.  Things are better in primary schools.  The information is there.  We know there are more kids coming through and we do not have the services in second level.  The thing about an education and health care plan, EHCP, is that it crosses everything.  This is about schools and health but it is also cradle to grave.  We all know the difficulty with adult services.  I ask the witnesses to go into a bit more detail on that.  I have covered the entire gambit and they have about two minutes to answer all that so I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#L00600","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I do not understand how representatives from the HSE can come in and say these things.

To keep families waiting months and years for a service and not provide it is hugely damaging.<\/p> <p>  The EHCP is in place in the UK.  It is clear that a lot of the Government bodies only respond to legislation so I would ask the committee to look at that.  The EHCP gives the child a right, from an educational perspective, to an all-encompassing plan for their lives.

Within that, a school may not be able to provide a service but the way the funding model works is different in England.  What the Deputy said about the schools is a good idea as they could plan in advance.  There is another issue with the application process.  We come across this with parents a lot.  The application process and the admissions legislation have changed.  Schools can no longer discriminate on anything to do with the Equal Status Acts.  Unfortunately, they can discriminate if a child is autistic and it is to do with autism classes.  In some schools they will say autism classes are for children with complex needs.  Schools can say that a child's level of cognition is a mild learning difficulty.  That means some parents, therefore, cannot apply to local schools or certain schools.  A number of parents had contacted us about that.  The only thing in the Education Act that we are aware of is to do with the special schools.  Parents also contact us about that.  They say they cannot send their children to a special school, even though they were told to make a section 29 appeal, because the child does not have a mild intellectual disability but a moderate one.  When I was looking for a school place for my child, we were told we were on the wrong side of a road to apply.  We were told to put together a section 29 application.  Parents might then go to the bodies that are supposed to be putting the policies in place and could be told again to take a section 29.  We have raised this with the Ombudsman and he said the Department of Education said if any parents know of this happening, they should advise the Department.  The Department should be making sure all the policies in schools are absolutely in accordance with what should be there.  That goes back to the governance and the boards of management.  We have raised that a little bit as well.  The inspectorate has said we should be looking at the governance and the boards of management and so on.  Schools are really complex when you are working in them.  We have to applaud our school leaders who are trying to instigate things and the voluntary people who go onto the boards.  If a parent has a difficulty with a school or needs to bring a grievance or complaint, we encourage our parents to work collaboratively.  It is very difficult.  Parents are extremely vulnerable and worry that their child will be asked to leave the school.  If someone has that fear every day and has nowhere else to go, it is really difficult to raise your voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#L01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>On the HSE issue, after the PTAs were deemed to be unlawful - it was one of our families that took that court case - DCA Warriors sent out a statement to most of the Ministers.

It is my job as a parent to make sure he reaches his potential.  He will.  We have a responsibility as a group, collectively and across all parties, to make sure we make changes.  Ms Kenny read out a quote from Donogh O'Malley, \"We will be judged by future generations on what we did for the children of our time.\"  That was pertinent in 1966 and unfortunately it is pertinent in 2022.

The HSE has let us all down by not forward planning to make sure we have sufficient professionals coming through the education system to fill the need that is there to provide services for our children.  The Disability Act 2005 was mentioned by a number of people.  I personally think it must be changed and we need to add the right to services.  It cannot be just be the right to an assessment because that is an opt-out clause.  We need to add services because every family has a right services for their children.

Again, great work is going on in those schools and great support is being given but this is something that needs to change culturally where children who have additional needs can also attend those schools, are supported, and that all of those schools, from a diversity and inclusion point of view, are supported.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that should be said is that the weighting is different in the context of the allocation of funding for additional educational needs services in girls&rsquo; schools because, historically, it was felt that girls had a lower presentation of different issues, but that is not true any more.  Things are changing as girls are beginning to receive diagnoses.  Girls tend to mask things a great deal more.<\/p> <p>  There are many matters in the context of funding.  In general, in respect of additional educational needs posts in schools, I spoke to a deputy principal yesterday who told me, which I did not understand, that the school is not funded.  It would have a great deal of work to do within that to ensure that the quality of education and the supports are there for those children.  Those schools are not allocated enough hours, which is dependent upon that.

I call this a reflective case study.  I have listened to some of the presentations prior to the break and I think they capture so much of the similarities of the journeys that we all have.  I come with both personal and professional experiences and expertise in what is an ever-expanding field of autism.  Equally, prior to addressing the committee, I reached out to autistic people, parents and professionals in education, health and disability disciplines, to garner what they view as the priority areas to explore with the committee.  Hence, my address reflects this valued input.<\/p> <p>  My journey in the world of autism began somewhat unexpectedly back in 1998, when my only child, Tom&aacute;s, was diagnosed as autistic at the age of two.  I was, to say the least, a maverick to autism.  I had trained and worked in both nursing, midwifery and sports injury therapy and at the time I was completing a BSc degree in sport and exercise science at the University of Limerick, as a mature student.  I took time out and set about educating myself in the field.  It was a quagmire to negotiate.  At that time, we had only disjointed and sample services in Ireland.  I reached out internationally to experts who directed me, accordingly, to what was then best practice in autistic education, health and well-being.  I travelled globally, completing courses as they arose.  Also, at that time I was fortunate to connect with parents on the same journey and a sharing of resources began.  Together with three mothers, I set up the first autism support group in County Clare.  We actively fundraised and brought experts from around the world to County Clare to get parental education off the ground.  Meanwhile, at home, Tom&aacute;s's trajectory was becoming more obvious.  He was a night runner, so rather than fighting the darkness, I got up and ran with him.  From early on, I learned the benefits of taking his lead.  It was to prove a lifesaver.<\/p> <p>  I returned to my studies and, with the support of my lecturers, I completed my degree and secured an Irish Research Council scholarship to do my PhD.  My study was the first to examine the development and delivery of movement programmes for students with disabilities in Irish schools and to further research the effects of such an intervention programme on the skills of autistic children.  It was the first study of its kind in Ireland and the findings did not surprise.  Then as now, teachers were clearly highlighting that they had neither the skills, equipment, supports nor time to develop or deliver programmes to autistic children, especially movement programmes.  Equally, the study showed that with intervention, students' skills not only in movement but also socially and emotionally, improved.  Our lives evolved at home.  Tom&aacute;s was in need of a primary education provision.  With the support of the principal in the local school, I researched, wrote and delivered our proposal for an autism-specific class to the Department of education, informed by international best practice.  We got approval and the class took off.  This was the first autism-specific class in a mainstream school in this country.<\/p><p>We had sought and secured in-class support for a visiting speech and language therapist, a visiting occupational therapist, a sport and exercise scientist, a psychologist to oversee the service, SNAs for each of the children and external review from Professors Rita Jordan and David Sugden, who had significant expertise in the field.  Within the year, there was a waiting list and again with active funding and the approval of the Department  of  Education, the autism unit was built.  This has now evolved to accommodate 12 students.  Staff associated with that service were actively encouraged to develop their knowledge and expertise with Professors Jordan and Sugden and many others and in-house workshops were the order of the day.  However, what was clearly identified and needed back at the outset in 2001 is as much a requirement today.  Clearly, current provision does not reflect this need.<\/p><p> Our lives evolved.  Tom&aacute;s was further diagnosed with learning disability and a speech and language disorder and he moved to St Clare&rsquo;s Special School for his ongoing education.  I completed my PhD and joined the staff at UCC as a lecturer and researcher in the School of Education.  During this time, I quickly established valued links in community.  My students and I evolved to gain hands-on experience developing, delivering and promoting quality movement programmes for autistic participants, from preschoolers to old age.  It was to have a profound effect on all of us involved.  Autistic children and adults, and indeed those with additional conditions and diagnoses thrived with hands-on, appropriate and evidence-based interventions that addressed frequency, intensity and duration of meaningful practice from trained personnel.  I received the President&rsquo;s Award for this work.  Tom&aacute;s was further diagnosed with epilepsy and catatonia of autism.  Epilepsy now affects 30% of the autistic population and catatonia of autism affects 18% of the autistic population.  I was fortunate to have been awarded a Fulbright scholarship in 2015.  Tom&aacute;s and I travelled to San Francisco to work with experts in the field, developing my own Get Autism Active online programme.  While there, expertise in the field of autism and health helped us source the appropriate expertise for catatonia.  We returned home and brought two teams of catatonia experts to Ireland to work with medical and social care teams here to establish clear evidence-based protocols in its management.  That is currently ongoing.<\/p><p> I left the post in UCC in 2018 and set up my own consultancy in the area of autism education and training with specific emphasis on the importance of developing quality movement skills.  As evidenced by my own work and that of others in the field, movement breaks are an integral part of each day for all on the spectrum for health, education and quality of life gains.  In 2019, Tom&aacute;s and I ran and walked the Wild Atlantic Way from Kinsale to Free Derry Corner on an \"Autism Active-Autism Aware\" agenda over 88 days.  We met many parents, professionals, passers-by and members of the public who sympathised, empathised and learned first-hand with us of autism and the power of movement.  Since then we have rolled out training to parents, professionals, libraries, and local community groups including businesses, sports partnerships and teacher education centres to mention but a few.  Here in Clare, organisations have evolved their service provision to include video vignettes of their services on social media and websites, sensory spaces and sensory kits, communication boards and autism aware understanding and acceptance training and certification.<\/p><p> In summary, from our case study and the voices of our fellow stakeholders the issues are still appropriate access to early diagnosis, intervention and support, the earlier the better and the greater the chance of success and development although it is never too late to intervene; appropriate education and training for all parents and professionals.  I speak quite a lot to educators and healthcare professionals and, time and again, they highlight clearly their own lack of training in the world of autism, their lack of awareness and understanding of autism and the greater issues and needs associated with diagnosis.  A further issue is access to appropriate education and service provision across the lifespan.  It does not start or stop with school-age children.  We see preschoolers being identified as presenting as autistic.  Surely we can identify up the line, if learning disability comes in at the age of four and something else comes in at the age of six, they are going to be in a service on an ongoing basis.  These issues need to be addressed across the lifespan.  Also needed is appropriate access to multidisciplinary professionals and services.  I heard many people speak earlier about the need for occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, psychology and so on.  All of these people need to be working together.  It has to be multidisciplinary.  As to where or how it is provided, I feel the educational setting is the place.  Back in the day when I set up the first unit it worked really well.  It showed a successful model of practice.  Respite provision and summer support services need to be addressed.  Clearly, if we address respite provision appropriately, parents, carers and others will maintain people in community in their own homes.  Equally, if the summer support service is developed and addressed properly it too can have significant positive impact on the health, wellbeing and education of children and adults who are autistic.  An interdepartmental &ldquo;top down-bottom up&rdquo; mindset change is needed.  I understand the committee was addressed by the HSE last week.  In my personal and professional experience there is no joined-up thinking whatsoever in the HSE.  That is a massive issue from start to finish.  This really has to be addressed from the bottom up but also from the top down.  Finally, when I see what we have achieved in County Clare and in different pockets around community and educational settings, I see no reason we cannot lead from the front as a country.  We should be making ourselves the autism hub of Europe.  We can be a model of research, policy and best practice if the will, commitment and energy are there to do so.  I look forward to the committee members' questions and thank them for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Crawford","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak this morning.  It has taken 20 years to get here so I am very happy to be here.  I am a lecturer and programme co-ordinator\/designer with adult continuing education at University College Cork, ACE at UCC, and I am adjunct faculty at Hibernia College Dublin.  I am currently also doing my PhD at Maynooth University on autism representation.  As we heard from Dr. Crawford, autism is not just our children being born; it affects all of our lives and we become experts in this area.  I am also a parent of a 24-year-old autistic son.  I co-founded the Special Needs Parents Association of Ireland in 2010.  We had to close because we were all burned out by 2020.  We supported 57,000 families across Ireland.  I have been a national and local advocate for parents, their children, for myself and for my son.  I also found out recently that I am also autistic.  I spent many years preparing my son for the world and decided that I was not going to wait any longer for the Oireachtas or the Government to make changes.  I was going to make changes myself and be proactive.  Even though my journey has been very difficult with my son, I am here today to talk briefly about autism policy and then about the groundbreaking work we are doing at ACE at UCC that illustrates what can be achieved when we have the will to change.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with autism policy.  As I always say to my students in autism studies, here is where things start getting very dark and cold.  I will be very blunt and brief.  It is a long, sad story.  Irish legislation and policy tends to be reactive rather than proactive.  It is put in place after something bad has happened, usually a court case.  We have currently no legislation that even mentions autism.  We have no accurate figures for autism in Ireland.  What we currently have is a mishmash of different figures that do not even consider adult diagnosis.  We have four working definitions of disability which do not mention autism and do not adequately describe it either.  We have had two defunct Autism Bills, an Autism Plan 2019, and one attempt at a strategy in 2021.  We have a number of autism reports going out across different Departments.  The one I really want the committee to reconsider, even though it is 21 years old, is the autism strategy of 2001.  I have included a link to it in my submission.<\/p><p>The autism task force report is so important because it had contributions from a number of experts from Ireland and from other jurisdictions comprised of parents, education and health professionals, advocates and researchers.  There was oversight from the head of the policy research unit in the faculty of law at the University of Galway.  Its remit was to provide a framework for the future development of a comprehensive and appropriate structure for education and support for this hitherto marginalised and misunderstood population.<\/p><p> It covered everything the committee has been discussing but it is 21 years old.   It is like the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN Act; it promised an awful lot and delivered very little.  Other jurisdictions have taken from our task force&rsquo;s work from 21 years ago.  That is very sad.  The language in Irish policy is used to both give and take away services and resources.  For example, terms like &ldquo;care needs&rdquo; and &ldquo;access to\" are usually misinterpreted.  <\/p><p> However, the second part of my submission is a bit more positive.  I do not want to be negative because a lot of what the committee has heard about what is happening in Ireland is negative and that is not the complete story.  I want to be positive and share the great work that we are doing at ACE in UCC where we create bespoke courses, from eight weeks to two years, to educate, empower, train and meet the needs of the autistic community and their families, as well as of industry to create employment for adults with autism.<\/p><p> Our approach is interdisciplinary and our key philosophy is to provide opportunities in lifelong learning for all adults irrespective of age and previous educational achievements.  Our ethos is of equality, diversity and inclusion for all.  These underpin our philosophy, our learning objectives and outcomes.  Our courses are built for diverse adult learners.  Our staff adopt the correct approach needed to enhance adults&rsquo; learning so that all students may have a rewarding educational experience.<\/p><p> Most of our programmes have buy-in from the communities that we work with.  For instance our diploma in autism studies was created by autistic adults in conjunction with academics who were either also autistic themselves or were the parents of children or adults with autism.   Some of the relevant part-time courses are the diploma in autism studies, the first autism studies course in Ireland, which is level 6-7.  Parents, SNAs, lecturers, disability resource and access officers were all in the same classroom working and learning together.  It is one of the first and only courses that does this in the country.  It awards a university qualification at the end.  The certificate in professional development in neurodiversity in the screen industry with Screen Ireland is first of its kind anywhere.  I have been invited all over the world to speak about this course.  That is how innovative it is.  We are the leaders in this area.  There is a certificate in professional development in advocacy, a pilot in neurodiversity in human resources, which is the first of its kind in Ireland, and pilot in well-being co-ordinator with Screen Ireland, the first of its kind in Ireland, also incorporates everything we have learned from our autism courses.  These courses are designed to create a culture in which everyone has the opportunity to thrive and participate in life, industry and leadership.  We are leaders.  We are at the forefront of this.  People ask me why we are doing this in Ireland but why should we not do this in Ireland?  Why should we not be proactive?  Why should we not be the leaders in this area?  I am sick, as a parent, of hearing about best international practice.  We have a very different culture to the rest of Europe.  The rest of Europe was out colonising the rest of the world and the Irish were getting colonised.  Why should we not be the leaders in this area?  <\/p><p> One last thing that I would like the committee to consider is the conversation that I have seen across so many times across everything the committee has been listening to, which is that getting funding for our students is our biggest issue and the biggest barrier our students face.  We are a self-funding department in UCC.  We are not like the rest of the university.  Many students do not fit under the social welfare models of grants as many can be carers who are not in receipt of social welfare or are freelance workers whose finance is not stable or both.  Our courses do not fit the Springboard model because we are teaching people to be better leaders in their communities and not to advance their employment opportunities.  There is no fund if you want to improve your knowledge to help others.  If we want more training on autism, we need to fund it and be innovative in how we do that.  This is the biggest barrier for the people that I represent.  As a parent, I want to see better educated workers and I would like to be part of that solution.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eleanor McSherry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McSherry and Dr. Crawford for their contributions to the committee.  I know they were listening to some of the earlier session, at least.  One thing common to all of those who have presented here is the amount of knowledge they have acquired out of necessity because the services and supports to support their children were not there.  I commend them on the work they have done.  The amount of information they have given us is immense.  Do either of our guests see a solution to what is happening at the moment?  The parents outlined the very limited supports through the CDNTs and a lack of appropriate class places for their children at preschool, primary and secondary school.  They did not go further afield but there is a problem after post-primary.  That is a cliff edge for many parents who say there is almost nothing there for autistic people at that point.  Dr. Crawford said it should be based in education.  We need to expand on that.  As she said, there is no joined-up thinking within the HSE.  Somebody needs to grasp this and address the problems because as everybody says, early intervention is key and many of these children are not getting any interventions at an early stage or a later stage.  I know that parents are so worried for the future for their children.  Do Ms McSherry or Dr. Crawford have further ideas on how to expand what they are doing and the awareness they are creating?  It needs to be expanded across the country into every field because we see employers not willing to employ autistic people.  It is a lack of awareness or education about what autism is and what supports someone in their employ needs, for example.  I am interested in any further thoughts or anything that we as a committee should propose in our report specifically around expanding knowledge and awareness of autism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#Q00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>This is what we are doing at ACE where we are looking at the gaps.  We have the expertise because a lot of our staff, 70% of them, are autistic themselves.  The majority are women and a lot have had late diagnosis.  My son is 24 years.  He was the perfect example of early education and intervention.  He was diagnosed at four years old and he got every single resource that he needed going into school.  It was before the cuts of 2006, which was my first time addressing a joint committee here.  I was here in 2006 saying exactly what these parents are saying today.  I do not know if that is a good or bad thing.  But once you went to second level, it was as if no one remembered.  I had the same reports.  Every transition you have to have the same reports and the same conversations.  That has never changed in the 24 years.  I have been doing this for 20 years.  Like Dr. Crawford, I have been here a lot.  We are changing the narrative whether people like it or not.  Whether or not there is change at government level, we are out there and we are making those changes ourselves because we see the detrimental effect it has on our children.  But we have to think about what we have already put in.  It is like parking on footpaths and people ask why there is not zero tolerance?  Why do we not apply the laws that we already have?  Why do we not use the information we already have?  We had it in the EPSEN Act and the 2001 task force report.  That is 21 years old.  The same conversation that we are having today was happening then.  Why was nothing really implemented?   We have the knowledge, expertise and hopefully we now have the will to do it; why are we not doing it?  We are waiting for the politicians.  As Dr. Crawford and I have said we are not going to wait.  We will just go out there and do it and we will change minds.  I have had conversations with the European Broadcasting Union to be its keynote speaker: an Irish person, mammy and carer.

People know, when they identify when there is something different or when something is emerging for a preschooler who is not engaging with other preschoolers, that they need to intervene, and the earlier and clearer the diagnosis, the better.  Only yesterday, I was speaking to a GP who was in tears telling me he could not access private-diagnosis psychology reporting.  Again, it has to meet the exact criteria of the HSE psychologists, which nobody can access.<\/p><p> All those issues need to be addressed.  The top-down issue needs to be shuffled and shaken up and, equally, from the bottom up, we need to start getting stuck in early on.  I always tell people when I am doing training that they should not wait for a diagnosis but rather get down on the ground and start engaging with their child, and it is the same for teachers in schools.  If they notice that a child is not able to communicate, they should start using pictures and implementing some type of intervention rather than leave him or her alone.  Every week is a week that cannot be gotten back.  It is never too late to learn a new skill, but we should not allow somebody to have to wait weeks, months or years for an intervention.<\/p><p> The needs of autistic people change all the time.  More than 30% of our population have a learning disability, so these long-term needs will evolve and change.  I specifically gave our case study as an example.  This is a young man with a diagnosis of autism, a learning disability, speech and language disorder and epilepsy - you name it; it is out there - but that is not unusual.  He is entirely unique.  Nevertheless, we had to go each step of the way and search for expertise somewhere else.  It was very challenging.  The HSE was not opening its arms to me and saying \"Well done, this is fantastic\".  I had to battle every step of the way to implement simple change and pay for it privately, bringing in those people, even though public psychiatrists, nurses and so on were sitting in on talks about catatonia of autism because they did not know what it was.<\/p><p> All those issues need to be addressed.  I always think of how quickly the smoking ban was implemented in this country and how people stuck to it.  If you want to be the change you want to see, you can do it and that is the bottom line.  We can talk about it forever and we are so right.  Why do we have to wait for somebody to take a case to say we have to do something about A, B or C?  If we implemented change as it was needed, we would save a fortune for the Exchequer, aside from anything else, if that might motivate legislators.  There are so many simple interventions that, if adhered to and implemented on time, can make the difference, and that is what I find most frustrating when I hear ongoing stories.  I have travelled this journey since 1996 and, for goodness sake, 27 years later, we are still here talking about what we do not have.  There is something seriously wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Crawford","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Our two guests are a breath of fresh air.  With their opening statements, their honesty and their bitterness and anger, they have thrown it all on the table and there is not one point one could argue against them, but it is important that the evidence given at these committee meetings goes on the record.  Dr. Crawford spoke about a pilot project.  Why has that not been replicated anywhere else?  Someone made the point that we are a reactive rather than proactive society.  I am black and blue from stating over recent years, including in the D&aacute;il Chamber, that this has been enshrined in the policies of this Government and previous Governments.  We are not visionaries.  Governments have been told repeatedly by the experts that something is going to happen, but then they wait for it to happen and wonder how it happened, even though they will have been told about it ten to 15 years or, in our the case of guests, 20-odd years earlier.<\/p> <p>  Ms McSherry's contribution was also amazing, outlining in detail a Pandora's box of courses and so on, which I will examine.  I am acutely aware of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022.  I asked this question in the earlier session, and Dr. Crawford spoke about how quickly we implemented the smoking ban.  Likewise, in the budget, excise duty on cigarettes and so on is imposed by midnight on the same day.  She referred to parking on footpaths, a pet hate of mine.  People do not understand that if someone has some form of a disability - I do not even like using that word - it is not always taken into consideration.  As I stated at a meeting of a previous committee, when I was a member of my local council, we listened to all the stakeholders when we were designing the main street in my town.  It was probably nine years ago.  We covered only 35% of the streetscape, because we met resistance, yet that 35% won a European mobility award because we listened to everybody and engaged with them.  <\/p> <p>  As legislators, what can we do in the here and now, not down the road?  I love our guests' determination and drive on this to say they will not listen to the bull crap anymore.   They are done with talking.  Dr. Crawford referred to the pilot project, while Ms McSherry referred to the research and the courses that are available.  What can we do as legislators, whether to the relevant Department or Minister, to say we have listened to all the experts - our guests and others - and ask why we cannot implement the changes now?  If they say it is about funding, there has to be funding somewhere to make this an all-Ireland pilot project, whereby resources could be pulled in from the European partners or whatever, and to replicate that.  What can we do in the here and now to drive this change?  Ours is a very different committee.  We are not playing politics.  We all have a passion for the issue.  I accept our guests will meet resistance.  How strongly does the HSE resist change?  I am well aware the idea of \"It's my way or the highway\" is ingrained in the culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#R00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question, which is, of course, entirely unanswerable at this stage.  My view is that we have to have a legislative commitment to change.  We should stop talking about it and say we are going to implement the following changes in the legislation, outline them and on we go.  One thing backed up by research is that if schools refuse to take autistic children, it means the buy-in is not there from the top down.  That is where we need to pull back a step and start educating educators on what is important and what is real inclusion.  We are good at firing out these words and we are very lofty as researchers and lecturers, going all over the world giving speeches about various subjects, but implementing change is very different, as in being the change.  I have often heard lofty conversations, lectures and keynote speeches from people talking about inclusion, whereas their own departments are not always so inclusive.  It has to be an inherent, philosophical sea change from the top down and the bottom up.  I see locally that if it is put to ordinary people on the ground that they can come and learn about autism or about our way of understanding and being, they will say all they want is to be told.  I have encountered this time and again.<\/p> <p>  The same is true of working from the top down to get teachers to buy in.  Of course, it has to go back to initial teacher education.  When I was at University College Cork, I conducted a study looking at initial teacher education and educators' ability, knowledge, skills and so on to accommodate students with disabilities in general or students who are autistic specifically, and they will scream about how they have no ability to do it properly.  They get whistle-stop tours through the subject in undergraduate education, and it is similar in postgraduate education unless the person tries to go deep into the issue as Ms McSherry and I have done.  Education is huge.  We need to back in there, strip it back and ensure it will be part and parcel of any educational process that autism is clearly specified to be addressed.<\/p><p>We are talking of one in 60, at least.  The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States speaks of about one in 54 of the population being autistic.  I would say Ireland is not far behind that, in reality.  It is about looking at it and saying that we will be the change we want to see, and starting in those areas such as education, health, and so on.<\/p><p>On the HSE, where would one begin?  I really mean this.  There is no joined-up thinking in the HSE.  I brought that expertise over from the US around the whole area of catatonia of autism and I now have any number of neurologists contacting me asking how to go about getting something similar in other pockets of the country.  The HSE should be doing that, not Susan Crawford as a parent.  There is so much wrong.  The HSE does not even look to know what is going on here local to us that we have set up and which they could be replicating around the country.  There is no joined-up thinking in the HSE.  There is a model of good practice here in the mid-west that has not spilled out around the country.  That is just a working example of the total lack of joined-up thinking.<\/p><p> Deputy Tully asked if I believe the education setting is ideal for having multidisciplinary team input.  It is a very definite time and day and there is scope there to plan and implement.  The other side of it is that anything we implement must be joined together so that the occupational therapist is working with the teacher, and the physiotherapist and speech and language therapist are working with the psychologist and so on, so we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.  If one is going off to a private therapist here and a private professional there and dipping pieces in, it is very hard to bring all of that together.  If all of this expertise is coherently in one spot it makes all the difference.  This is why, back in the day, our unit just took off.  It had everything going for it just so seamlessly.<\/p><p> I cannot speak strongly enough about the importance of movement.  If autistic children are learning movement skills from an early age it can be a lifesaver in terms of managing their behaviours and keeping them regulated.  Movement breaks throughout the day can mean somebody is not coming home and attacking their parents or whatever is going on in many houses, as we know.  The reality is that these types of measures need to be implemented and put in place in schools, and ingrained in the educators as well.  Back in that time, two experts Dr. Rita Jordan and Professor David Sugden came into the unit to work with the staff.  Ongoing workshops were the order of the day before any Croke Park hours or anything else.  It was all part and parcel of what that whole process was.  We knew a bigger picture had to be filled and we knew that the workshops and the continuing professional development had to be ongoing.  There were all of those little steps that can be implemented.<\/p><p> As legislators, I say that members must hammer on the door and be the ones who actually draw up the change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Crawford","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>It is a tough question.  As I tell the students, I bring them down because the rest of the course is very positive but I always get stuck with the module that is very dry and very boring and very sad.  From an educational point of view, I supervise Master's students in education in the professional Master's in Education at Hibernia, for post-primary and primary.  A lot of the students have a huge lack of knowledge in this area but they want to understand.  With regard to the training and the resources in the longer term I believe it will cost a lot of money to fix the problems that are there but it is an investment in our future.  We had it 21 years ago and we chose not to use it.  There have been Bills and strategies that were just left by the wayside.  I understand that the State is limited in the financial context, but we would be creating a financial burden at the other end of it if we are turning out teenagers from second level education with serious mental health issues and suicidal ideation.  We need to address that issue.  This is what we are creating by not being proactive and grabbing the nettle.<\/p> <p>  Many of the teachers that my son came across were very positive.  It was the system that was the problem.  The teachers were willing to meet us halfway and willing to work with my child.  I do not have a sad story in that respect but for him there were barriers there in the system.  The State does not recognise hidden disabilities in our resourcing.  It is not recognised.  My son had double scoliosis in his back and autism.  I brought in all of the documentation yet I was told that he was to go to the third floor for his locker.  One year into the school year I found out that there was a lift, but the lift was for children with physical difficulties.  What is double scoliosis?  I do not understand that.<\/p> <p>  I also come from a medical background and I understand the monolith of the HSE.  The HSE is an intransigent group that will never talk.  I was told by my psychologist \"There is the Department of Education and there is the HSE, and never the twain shall meet.\"  That is the wrong attitude right there.  We have the legislation but we just need to have zero tolerance on what is happening.  We need to implement what we have already looked at, and we have looked at it for 21 years.  We are not creating something completely different.  We have a lot of the skills and we already have a lot of the material here.  If we actually had the political will to follow through then change would happen.  I see my students who are empowered and who are coming out of their course with attitude change.  I have autistic adults in my class who are now becoming advocates for the community.  I did that and I am proud of that, but I did that without all of the members.  I did that because I wanted to make change and because Dr. Crawford wants to make change.  We want the Government to fund this properly, to think about what has already been done and to look at what is there.  There is a plethora of information already here.  This is what I am asking the committee members to do.  I ask the members to be proactive.  We already know what needs to be done and we have heard it here, but we have been saying it for 21 years and we are not waiting any longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eleanor McSherry"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agaibh.

That was very clearly put and in fairness to Deputy Buckley beforehand, he said what needed to be said about Dr. Crawford and Ms McSherry and the fabulous work that is being done.<\/p> <p>   Dr. Crawford spoke about the necessary legislative answer.  We are aware of the whole issue in relation to schools, which is the preparatory work combined with the big stick, if necessary, to ensure we have the system our kids require.  We could have all of the legislative pieces and that would not matter unless we do the work to ensure we have the capacity and the resources.  This is accepting completely that we have a broken up system with silo answers, and that we do not deal with citizens from the cradle to the grave and all of the various pieces within that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak about the movement aspect  I get the notion; if our Turlough was not given movement breaks and regulations then we would have all sorts of incidents.  I heard talk before about movement and the release of a particular protein.  One often hears about magic bullets with regard to movement with horses but the idea that it is just movement is hard to believe.  The way it was sold to me was that the release of this protein can almost bypass, for a period of time, the difficulties that autistic people have and can facilitate learning.  Perhaps the witnesses could give us some insight on that.  It is probably an unfair question but that is the nature of the questions I can ask.<\/p> <p>  Ms McSherry spoke about the autism strategy of 2001.  Can we put down, straightforwardly, exactly what we are talking about here and what are the necessary pieces that are not in play at the minute?  Perhaps it would be difficult to answer in just three minutes but will Ms McSherry also explain how these courses work?  I find the whole idea very interesting.

It is a very meaty document.  I could not even begin to outline it but there are a lot of very good recommendations in there.  Some of them have been touched on such as intensive support programmes, ISPs.  Every single strategy or policy that has come after has always come back to that document.  We already have it.  It is here and basically it was shelved.  There is a lot of material in there.<\/p> <p>  The autism studies course we do is a two-year course.  We have a waiting list.  We are evaluating it at the moment and we constantly evaluate it.  We give an online offering and we give an in-class offering for it in Cork and in Limerick.  Our current waiting list to go onto the course is 120 people, but we only have 60 places.  It caters to special needs assistants, teachers, disability officers, HSE nurses, intellectual disability nurses and, most important, parents.  The fantastic thing about it is that it is not a postgraduate course; it is not disciplinary, it is interdisciplinary.  The conversations in the room are fantastic because parents are learning from teachers and teachers are learning from parents.<\/p><p>Everybody comes out with an attitude.  When I started teaching it ten years ago I was a lecturer on policy practice, law and representation and I came in with a position that there should be no institutionalisation at all but then from listening to intellectual disability nurses, people from Enable Ireland and people from Inclusion Ireland I heard that there is a place for every kind of intervention because some people will have difficulty living in the community.  Baroness Warnock coined the term social inclusion and said that everybody should be socially included but she came back in the early 2000s and said that without resourcing and funding we are throwing people to the wolves.  That is the difficulty with it.<\/p><p> The autism disability study is a fantastic programme and I am very proud of it.  I am proud of our students because they go on to become leaders in their communities.  We are empowering parents, who are able to stick up for themselves.  That is why we created the advocacy course, which is a five-credit course that is a follow-on to that for anybody from youth and community work, mental health in the community, and we have a higher diploma in inclusion.  I have a parent who is doing a master's in University College Galway on advocacy and international advocacy and she came into us as a carer who was never in education because she could not be in education.  She has scraped together the funding to do this.  I am very proud of the work we do in ACE.  We are 75 years doing it and we are getting bigger and better all the time.

We are going back to the protein and that is an interesting point.  We know that movement enhances the formation and healthy use of a thing called gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, which is important for regulation and mood enhancement.  Interesting studies have been done to look at the effects of movement against the effects of electroconvulsive therapy to enhance feelings of well-being and reduce anxiety.  It has been found that if you get high levels of GABA that has a positive effect.  That is why we are driving an agenda on movement to reduce anxiety and all of that.  We know that movement enhances the secretion of those hormones like serotonin and dopamine, etc., which are necessary for normal brain function.  Equally they are mood regulators.  For any number of reasons, movement is key.<\/p> <p>  The other thing we know is that our population, including children and adults who are autistic, do not naturally develop movement skills.  They have to be taught how to hop, jump, kick and throw.  They often have to be taught how to run as well and they have to work on balance and co-ordination.  I am involved in an international research group on movement, and that work will probably be included as part of the diagnostic criteria for autism over the coming years.  It is key that we look at movement from early on and we are looking at videos of babies who are later diagnosed as autistic where those movement markers have been picked up early on when they are babies and on into when they are toddlers.  Movement is key so if we could get that piece into the pre-schools and primary and secondary schools and drive it in a real and meaningful way in terms of proper movement breaks it can make a difference.

We deal with a lot of children with autism.  What should be happening?  I know the witnesses are going back to the autism task force report from 2001.

If there were three things the witnesses would like to see being implemented now that can be done under existing legislation, what would they be?

When you get your diagnosis you have to wait a massive amount of time and that has never changed.  I also mention proper resourcing, training across the board and a multidisciplinary solution for a multidisciplinary problem.  It is not just the HSE, but also the training.<\/p> <p>  We should remember that at the end of the day, in order to make change we need to have everyone buying into it.  As I said, I trained teachers and so has Dr. Crawford and I also come from a medical family.  There can be an issue every time a change is brought in, like when we found out this week that all of a sudden principals will be doing assessments of need.  I have seen that in the Twitter sphere, which has gone crazy with the news.  We cannot have this swipe-of-a-pen attitude.  The catalogue of disasters we have involves reactiveness like that.  We need to be able to look at a multidisciplinary solution that has buy-in.  We must have all of the people at the table and make the decision.  There is no point in saying we will have an autism unit in a school if the teachers in the school are asking where it will be put and who the teachers who will go into it are.  What you do in that case is turn the teachers against you and sending the parents into that atmosphere is a nightmare.  I had that when my sons started in secondary school and I gave them all that information but they did not have enough SNAs for the 16 boys with autism they had in the school.<\/p><p>My son had a full-time special needs assistant, SNA, whose hours were divided, and I ended up with a child who was on suicide watch.  I do not want that situation to happen to any other parent, but I have heard of it happening ever since.  As I said, once the waiting lists, resourcing and all of these are resolved, it will solve all those multitude of problems, but we need to have the buy-in.  There is no point in us all demonising the HSE and in putting them on the outside of the conversation.  That is not going to work.  Do not put the teachers on the outside of the conversation.

Education is key, as is a wholistic approach to education.  I am not just talking about educators, but about starting with educating parents by having appropriate expertise coming into the community and working with people.  We were doing it here in Clare in the late 1990s, where we brought in the picture exchange communication system, PECS, teachers and all those experts who were brought in together with parents who were fundraising to get things up and going.  This was so that people could understand what was available to them.<\/p> <p>  Equally, we have to educate legislators, as well as staff in the HSE who are not necessarily coming with a background in the area of disability but who may be working in that area.  There is a greater piece around autism, which is that we must have respect for and understanding of autistic communities.  This is not just a matter of one type of a disability, but it is a way of being.  The autistic communities truly believe that this is who we are and this is our piece.  People need to be educated on all of that.  Education is far greater than just the educators.  It is so much more and involves a wholistic approach to education.  I always believe in the business of top-down and bottom-up.  We have to work with the people on the ground coming up and, equally, we have to be willing to make changes from the top-down.  That mindset has to change across so many different Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022102500002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Crawford"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I have a final question on that.

If we want diversity and inclusion for everybody, we have to stop thinking along the lines of, &ldquo;everybody is coming in on my patch&rdquo;.

First, Ms Crawford&rsquo;s comments about top-down, bottom-up is what this committee is about.  We want to hear from people and from parents to be able to form a bottom-up proposal to Government so that when we produce our report at the end of next March, there will be recommendations that will make change.  It is incumbent on us as public representatives, as well as on whoever may follow us as the years go on, to make sure that it is a living report; we must make sure that all of those recommendations are implemented over as short a number of years as is possible.<\/p> <p>  I compliment Ms McSherry in particular on the course that she is doing and the fact that, as she said, it is empowering parents to be advocates in their own community.

I do not know if the Chair knows this already, but if one applies for the grant for education, it has to be for a certain criterion or type of course.  If it is a short course, they can forget about it because they will not get any funding.  It has to be a diploma or a certificate at a level 6, which is what our course is.  They have to apply for it, and they will get the funding after they do the course.  Therefore, the parent has to come up with the funding before they start.  Our course at the moment costs approximately &euro;1,200, which is a lot of money for a carer.  For a carer who may be working a couple of hours, it is a lot of money, especially in light of the way finance has gone.<\/p> <p>  We are self-funding, therefore, all our courses have to be paid for.  That money pays for the lectures, the marketing and everything.  We are therefore not like the rest.  For a student who is going through education as an undergraduate, their fees will be paid partially by the Government, but we do not get that kind of funding and we cannot apply for it because we are not a charity.  We are therefore in a grey area within the funding mechanisms that are there for carers, if they are not on welfare and are not full-time carers.<\/p> <p>  I was not a carer and was &euro;50 over the threshold so we never got carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I went back to further education, and I funded myself through that as an adult learner.  I did not go into education through the traditional model.  I found that we just made do.  That is what we had to do.  My husband was a teacher, so we were supposed to be in the \"higher-paid echelons\".  That is what I am told every day, that we are in the middle classes, and that we are funding the whole country.  That used to disgust me because I never asked for anything.  I never asked for anything, and I was never entitled to half of anything.  I did get a domiciliary care allowance, before the committee members go checking and out me.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we recognise that we might not get job advances, but it is a springboard if I want to get another job.  However, it is a matter of whether I want to improve, and if I want to be aware of training for neurodiversity, like what we are doing for the screen industry.  While the screen industry is paying for that, it is paying for 20 students, but let us say that there are 60 students.  We have an Irish student who is living in America, and who is a director.  He wants to do our course from America.  We have created the course so that it is recorded, so that he can come in at any time because we need to see more people who are autistic on our television screens.  We need to see representation because what we see on our screens is an issue that I have not seen any of the committee members speak about so far.<\/p><p>We have only ever had two autistic characters in the history of Irish television.  If I cannot see somebody like myself, how the hell am I going to walk around in the community?  I have seen loads of documentaries and sad stories.  I have seen it in the news.  That content is there but we do not have content in drama or autistic actors and directors.  They are there but they are afraid to say who they are.  That is why we are trying to change that narrative.  We are educating within industry.  We are now starting a course for human resources for people such as managers, in particular in the pharmaceutical industry, because they know people who are autistic or neurodiverse are working there.  They are already employing them but these people are leaving the job rather than staying in it because the conditions are so bad for them.

I am a climate activist from Kenya.  Right now, it is evident that the people least responsible for the climate crisis are bearing the biggest brunt.  We are already witnessing devastating loss and damage from the devastating flooding across west and central Africa to the prolonged drought that has hit the Horn of Africa and has seen five consecutive rainy seasons fail.  These impacts are impacts of climate inaction and they are claiming lives and livelihoods and displacing people from their homes.  Millions are facing climate-related starvation.  As the impacts of climate change start to land, the education and empowerment of women and girls also suffer because climate change is forcing girls out of schools.  It is clear that loss and damage are critical issues at the moment that need to be addressed; they are becoming the priority and defining issues for COP27.<\/p> <p>  At the opening ceremony of COP26, I held world leaders to a moment of compassionate silence for the billions of people not present in that room whose stories were not being heard and whose suffering was not being felt.  We still left COP26 with nothing more on loss and damage than a promise to have an annual dialogue.  We left COP26 still on course for 2.7&deg;C of global heating.  This is going to make larger parts of my continent uninhabitable.  Since then, I have been spending time with communities in my country, Kenya, who are also severely affected by the nature, food, and hunger emergency caused by the devastating droughts across the Horn of Africa.  Our natural ecosystems - our life support systems - have been pushed beyond breaking point.  People tell me the only thing left to lose is hope, yet wealthy countries with the greatest historical emissions are not acting fast enough to help frontline communities to cope with the devastation they are facing.  This is not what climate justice looks like.  Climate justice is not abandoning frontline communities to their fate.  That is why I was compelled to launch a public campaign letter a few months ago calling for climate justice and calling on leaders to help frontline communities by delivering loss and damage finance.  This letter has now received over 100,000 signatures worldwide.<\/p> <p>  I was compelled to write this letter after spending time with the people of Wajir County in the north-eastern part of Kenya.  During my time there, I completely understood and felt their human lived experience of the climate crisis.  This includes terrifying levels of water and food insecurity and thousands of livestock animals dropping dead from thirst and starvation - livestock that provides 80% of people&rsquo;s livelihood.  Young girls are being pulled out of school because their families can no longer afford to pay school fees.  I also saw decimated wildlife populations in the same region and babies struggling to stay alive because their hungry mothers cannot produce enough milk to feed them.  These communities need to recover, reconstruct, rehabilitate and even build their resilience.  They are not sitting back and doing nothing, despite receiving no support.  They are showing every day what real climate leadership and solutions look like.  The women, for instance, are having to walk distances as long as 12 miles in search of food and water.  They are also restoring degraded forest lands and finding ways to grow drought-resistant crops.  Frontline communities are clearly coming together, creating movements for change, educating themselves on the climate crisis and even offering clean energy solutions, among others.  Frontline communities need our help because they are also the solution to the climate crisis.  They have the strength and solutions that they know work for them.<\/p> <p>  Having heard that, we cannot ignore the fact that COP27 must put justice at the centre of negotiations.  Justice is not forcing countries into further debt due to climate disasters they did not cause.  Take the example of Mozambique, which was forced into further debt when the cyclones hit.  Most of the climate finance delivered to the most impacted countries, if it is not in the form of pledges that have been made and not met, is in the form of loans, which is driving them into deeper debts.  That definitely is not what climate justice looks like.  Justice means delivering on promises that have been made and not met.  It also means that rich countries, who have greatly profited at our expense, should provide the resources they promised in order that countries like mine can develop in a just, sustainable and resilient way.<\/p><p>Justice also means we must be honest and take responsibility.  <\/p><p> Small island states raised the need to address loss and damage 30 years ago.  We can clearly say that 30 years of climate inaction have led us to the scale of loss and damage we are experiencing today.  It is time for leaders to take responsibility for that inaction and pivot further towards solidarity.  In practical terms, that also means establishing additional financial support for loss and damage and finally establishing a loss and damage finance facility.  We do not want to leave COP27 with only another promise to keep talking about it.  That is not acceptable.<\/p><p> This is not only about money because money can never replace what the people I met in Wajir have already lost.  This is about justice.  COP27 is our chance to bring justice to impacted communities through global solidarity and co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Wathuti","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the opportunity to present today on behalf of the Stop Climate Chaos coalition.  My central message is that this is the critical decade for international climate action and time is not on our side.  Ireland must contribute bold and fast actions to the global effort to tackle the climate crisis and COP27 must demonstrate higher ambition to contain the substantial risks associated with warming beyond 1.5&deg;C.<\/p> <p>  We are already at 1.2&deg;C of warming.  The national pledges at COP26 last year were not sufficient and now countries must ratchet up their pledges before COP27, keeping in mind two important points.  First, 1.5&deg;C is still feasible but global emissions must peak immediately, that is,  by 2025 at the latest, reduce by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.  According to the UN Emissions Gap Report that was published recently, globally we need three times more mitigation than is currently planned in order to reach a 1.5&deg;C pathway by 2030.  The COP27 negotiations must make progress in closing the emissions gap by ramping up the ambition of those nationally determined contributions through the mitigation work programme, setting ambitious 2030 targets, providing clarity on what limiting temperature rise to 1.5&deg;C means for the remaining global carbon budget, emissions reductions and fossil fuel phase-out targets.<\/p> <p>  Wealthy high-emitting countries such as Ireland must cut emissions more steeply and reach net zero as quickly as possible and before 2050.  Ireland has already used approximately 23.5% of the emissions allowance for the first carbon budget in 2021 alone according to the recent annual review by the Climate Change Advisory Council.  The new climate action plan due next month must specify the implementation pathways for rapid delivery of new and already-committed-to measures to ensure immediate emissions reductions.<\/p> <p>  Looking to the post-2030 period, it is important the Climate Change Advisory Council carries out further analysis on the provisional third carbon budget to ensure the pathway and the timeline to net zero reflect climate justice and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.  <\/p> <p>  For Ireland to take a leadership role at COP27, the Government must deliver on its EU commitments and submit the long-term strategy before COP27 begins.  The strategy is already approximately two and a half years late and the Commission recently issued Ireland with a formal notice for failure to submit.  This strategy, together with the updated climate action plan, must set out bold and fast actions that Ireland will take to reach net zero as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Br&iacute;d Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak.<\/p> <p>  As international aid and development organisations, we already see the impact that climate change is having around the world and recognise the profound inequality described by Ms Wathuti.  To address it, my colleague Dr. Walsh has already spoken about the need for deep, rapid and sustained emissions cuts.  My colleague Ms Curran will discuss loss and damage in more detail. I will focus in my remaining time specifically on the issue of climate finance including what support has been pledged, what has been delivered, and crucially how Ireland compares.<\/p> <p>  At COP15 in Copenhagen way back in 2009 and reaffirmed in Paris in 2015, wealthy countries pledged to provide $100 billion per year in financial support to developing countries for climate action to both reduce emissions and to help build resilience and protect communities.  The underlying rationale is that wealthy countries should take the lead because, historically, their emissions have caused the crisis and they have greatest financial capacity.  This is essentially a form of the polluter pays principle, whereby climate finance is a responsibility rather than a question of charity.  It is not some form of an optional extra but the repayment of an ecological debt and a key pillar of the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>  A decade later this target has not been met, with OECD data showing that US$83 billion was provided in 2020.  However, as Ms Wathuti noted, the vast majority of this money was in the form of repayable loans that only add to unsustainable debt burdens and ultimately leave the costs still shouldered by the world&rsquo;s poorest.  A further portion was mobilised private finance that tends to flow towards projects that can deliver a return on investment rather than where need is greatest.  Taking all of this into account, colleagues in Oxfam estimate that just $21 billion to $24 billion in public climate finance was provided in 2020, which is less than a third of the headline figure and just a quarter of what was promised.<\/p> <p>  In assessing Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this global effort we look primarily at two things.  They are quality and quantity.  In quality, Ireland has been a leader.  Much like our record on official development assistance, ODA, more broadly, Irish climate finance is provided publicly on a grant basis as opposed to through loans.  There is an important focus on adaptation and building capacity and resilience in poorer countries.  Transparency is relatively high, with much of the relevant data published in yearly reports by Irish Aid.  Taken together, this is a commendable track record that should be strengthened and advocated for both within the EU and at the Conference of the Parties, COP.<\/p> <p>  On quantity however the story is very different.  The chart that members have to hand shows Irish climate finance since the $100 billion pledge was made.  They will see roughly &euro;35 million was contributed on average for the first six years, before a rise in 2016, although a portion of this was due to a change in reporting rules and what was eligible to be counted.  From 2019 onwards, levels plateau at just over &euro;90 million.<\/p> <p>  The second chart below, however, provides some crucial perspective.  The red marker reflects the pledge made by the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, at COP26 in November 2021 to increase Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to at least &euro;225 million per year by 2025.  The green marker however reflects best current academic estimates of our actual fair share of the global target, which is calculated based on factors like historic emissions, financial capacity and different pathways to staying under 1.5&deg;C of warming.  A combination of a range of recent estimates gives us an approximate figure of &euro;545 million per year.<\/p> <p>  From this perspective, we see the blue contributions line flatten out significantly and the key takeaway is immediately apparent.  We are providing less than one fifth of our fair share and are failing on a key global justice component of the Paris Agreement.  It is also important to note that the $100 billion target is a wholly political figure.  It is not based on any scientific assessment of need and is widely recognised as insufficient.  Work is under way at COP to try to revise it upwards.  As such, this green line should be considered the floor of our ambition and something we should be delivering now, rather than pushing out to 2025.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, states clearly that this finance should be new and additional to meet the full incremental costs borne by developing countries.  This principle is extremely important.  It is designed to ensure that contributions do not detract from already limited ODA budgets, leaving the world&rsquo;s poorest to choose between existing development needs like schools and hospitals and adaptation measures like flood defences.  It is for this reason that some countries, such as Denmark, only count contributions above the long-standing target of 0.7% of gross national income, GNI.  By contrast, the current programme for Government instead commits to doubling the share of ODA that can be counted as climate finance.  This is concerning because it risks reconfiguring existing ODA, rather than making a concerted effort to increase contributions overall.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that this is extremely challenging but that is a reflection of the seriousness of the situation we are in.<\/p><p>The only way to rise to it is for countries like Ireland to step up, meet the target in this document and provide the leadership we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this morning.  Tr&oacute;caire works across 24 countries worldwide, and many of the communities with which we work in partnership are on the front line of the climate and biodiversity crisis.  We work with our colleagues in Stop Climate Chaos across a range of climate justice issues, and as Mr. O'Neill mentioned, I will focus on loss and damage.  As Ms Wathuti has said, loss and damage is an issue that speaks to the heart of climate injustice.  While some of the poorest countries in the world who have contributed least to the climate crisis are experiencing massive losses and damage from climate impacts, they are being left to pay for a crisis not of their making.  This is diverting much-needed public finance for sustainable development into dealing with crises and is pushing countries further into debt.  It is a matter of climate justice that richer countries including Ireland, contribute to, and support the development of this third pillar of finance under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC.<\/p> <p>  Addressing loss and damage must be framed within a human rights-based approach under common but differentiated responsibilities.  I speak as millions of people in the Horn of Africa and east Africa are experiencing crisis levels of hunger due to the worst drought in 40 years.  The losses and damage in this context are profound, with a likely declaration of famine in parts of Somalia in the coming weeks.  People in Somalia are facing starvation, mass displacement, loss of homes, livelihood and livestock, and, for many pastoralists, loss of their way of life due to the climate crisis.  The injustice is stark when we consider that Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and South Sudan represent 2.75% of the world&rsquo;s population but account for just 0.1% of global carbon emissions.  It is estimated that Ireland produces nearly 54 times higher emissions than Somalia alone.<\/p> <p>  Despite decades of struggle by small island states and countries most vulnerable to climatic shocks to deal with loss and damage, it has been excluded from the financial architecture of the UNFCCC.  In practice, this means there is no accessible and predictable finance for crucial measures such as rehabilitation, reconstruction and unavoidable relocation caused by climate events.  This is a glaring omission and this third and missing pillar of finance must be provided in addition to mitigation and adaptation finance and to official development assistance.  Loss and damage have a particular gendered impact as women and girls experience greater climate impacts due to factors such as unequal access to resources, limited mobility and less access to decision-making.  Therefore, communities need access to gender-responsive, adequate and predictable finance that meets their needs.  It is crucial this is provided in the form of grants and does not contribute to further unsustainable debt for the poorest countries in the world.  Given the rising scale of climate-related damage, there is no time to lose.<\/p> <p>  COP 27 is a moment for Ireland to show global leadership, solidarity and political will.  If the UNFCCC continues to fail to address loss and damage and the demands of the global south, its credibility will be severely undermined.  We are calling on Ireland to support the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility to support loss and damage as a permanent agenda item at COP.  These are demands from our partners throughout the global south, including the least developed countries which Ireland has prioritised in climate action.  We also call on the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to follow the lead of Denmark and commit initial loss and damage finance.  This will be a sign of leadership and a political signal of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to addressing loss and damage before COP 27.<\/p> <p>  For the people we work with, this is not a matter for their grandchildren or a fear for the future; it is their daily reality.  We call on Ireland to do the right thing and we implore committee members to take action to ensure Ireland becomes a leader and voice for justice, equality and human rights in climate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Curran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee for this opportunity to present today.  Friends of the Earth strongly supports the recommendations made in the previous statements.  My main message is that, at COP 27, the Government should support the development of a new global fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.  My written submission contains further background information.  What is this proposed treaty?  This type of agreement has been proposed as a mechanism to ensure effectively and equitably that fossil fuels remain in the ground.  The three main pillars put forward for such a treaty are to prevent the expansion of fossil fuels by ending all new exploration and production, to manage phasing out of existing production of fossil fuels in line with the Paris Agreement, and to ensure a just transition for communities and countries.<br\/><br\/>Why is it necessary?  The disastrous effects of the climate crisis and the need for immediate government action on fossil fuels have been well addressed, including in two further Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, assessment reports this year, yet governments are going in the wrong direction.  Several authorities, including the UN and the International Energy Agency, have concluded that every new fossil fuel development fundamentally undermines the achievement of the Paris Agreement and makes climate disaster all the more likely.<br\/><br\/>Why now at COP 27?  The Paris Agreement itself is evidently fundamental in terms of obliging climate action among states.  However, it does not make any reference to the main culprit, fossil fuels.  The UN summit is the ideal forum in which to address this and to highlight the need for a treaty to deliver an equitable phasing out.  We are now witnessing European states shifting focus and seeking narrowly to define energy security as fossil fuel supply.  There is now the very real danger that the energy crisis will result in further long-term dependency on expensive, polluting fossil gas.  Certain European states are seeking to expand gas production in Africa and ignoring gas demand reduction measures in Europe itself.  However, there is significant momentum behind the development of this treaty.  It has already been backed by Vanuatu, Timor Leste, the WHO, thousands of civil society organisations, and experts.  Last week, the European Parliament passed a landmark resolution calling on member states to work on developing a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.<br\/><br\/>On a related but separate note, an existing international agreement, the Energy Charter Treaty, poses fundamental risks of fossil fuel lock-in which have still not been addressed at an EU level.  Indeed, both France and the Netherlands have just announced that they will follow Spain, Italy and Poland in exiting the Energy Charter Treaty.  We urge Ireland to do likewise.<br\/><br\/>Why Ireland?  In terms of domestic policy, Ireland holds greater historical responsibility for the climate crisis.  Ireland has already positioned itself as a first mover in committing to phase out fossil fuels.  Last year the Government legislated to prevent new licences for oil and gas exploration in Irish waters.  Ireland also has a moratorium on liquefied natural gas and a legislative ban on fracking.  Further fossil fuel development is not compatible with our climate Act, and such developments have recently been rejected by the Government's independent consultants as part of the energy security review.<br\/><br\/>On foreign policy, Ireland became a founding member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance at COP 26 last year.  The first of its kind, this alliance aims to keep fossil fuels in the ground by bringing together countries that have taken steps to end new licensing for fossil fuel exploration and production.  We are calling on the Government to use this alliance to build diplomatic support for a treaty and develop a UN resolution on this issue.<br\/><br\/>The call for the development of a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty draws on lessons from other treaties to manage global threats, such as nuclear weapons.  For decades, thanks to the dedication of successive Ministers and officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ireland has led the way on disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation at UN level.  We are calling on the Government to resource the development of a treaty on fossil fuels as an essential element of international peace and security in the same way as it has supported the nuclear non-proliferation agenda.<br\/><br\/>We also very much welcome that Ireland has elevated climate concerns at the UN Security Council and raised support for the least developed countries and small island developing states.  It is this context that the COP and Ireland's final months on the UN Security Council come into focus.  Island states like Vanuatu and Timor Leste have already called for this global treaty.  One may legitimately ask what support for these states means in reality if it does not involve a focus on preventing the polluting fossil fuels that are driving the loss of their territories.<br\/><br\/>Phasing out fossil fuels is the test for climate leadership at COP 27.  To quote the UN Secretary General:<\/p> <blockquote> \tClimate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals.  But, the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.<br \/><br \/>Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.  Such investments will soon be stranded assets - a blot on the landscape and a blight on investment portfolios.  But, it doesn't have to be this way. <\/blockquote> <p>To summarise the main recommendations for the Minister which the committee has heard this morning: one, support higher ambition to close the emissions gap at EU level and at COP 27 and submit Ireland's long-term strategy prior to the COP to have a credible voice; two, rapidly scale up climate finance contributions in line with our fair share and make sure the money is reaching the poorest communities; three, support loss and damage as a permanent agenda item, including the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility and commit initial loss and damage finance; and four, support a new global fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank all who spoke for keeping their statements to about five minutes.

I will start my questions with Mr. McEvilly on the oil and gas treaty that he mentioned.  I will preface this by saying I am against any further oil and gas exploration.  It is often heard said, certainly in the D&aacute;il Chamber and in commentary in the media, that we need to ramp up our own oil and gas exploration.   Barryroe, which is just off west Cork where I come from, is often referenced as the answer to our energy crisis.  These are other people's comments, not mine, just to clarify that again.  What does Mr. McEvilly say to that kind of commentary, that we need to accelerate oil and gas exploration off the Irish coast?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#E00200","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>First, and this very much links in with the ongoing energy security review, so I will try not to go into too much detail here, there is no energy security without climate security.  We are moving away from the stage where one can, with any degree of legitimacy, suggest the climate impacts will not be disastrous.  Second, and this is referenced in the statement, Ireland has clear national, EU and international climate obligations.  If new fossil fuel infrastructure is brought on stream, the first risk is locking in emissions, fundamentally preventing adherence with those climate obligations.  The second risk is that, as new renewable storage, interconnection, demand reduction and energy efficiency is ramped up over the next three decades, there are very real risks such infrastructure will become stranded assets.  They are the two main arguments with regard to this idea that additional fossil fuel infrastructure or supply would be a free lunch.  I appreciate, in terms of immediate energy security concerns, that there are questions to be answered, which I do not want to dismiss, but it is also important to remember that any likely future fossil fuel infrastructure, even if we wanted it, would more than likely only be available in several years' time, so it would not respond to the immediate crisis.<\/p> <p>  No one in this committee needs any reminder of the extreme challenges caused by the increasing prices of fossil fuels.  We need to ask ourselves if we want to commit to a guaranteed, expensive and volatile fuel in the long term, which will fundamentally impact upon households.  Bringing it back to the proposed treaty, which I have mentioned, I fully appreciate that the development of a new global fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty would inevitably be a long-term process.  This would not be a treaty that flicks the switch overnight and suddenly prevents fossil fuels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I have one more question to ask the other panellists.  To add to that, from my assessment of this talk of Barryroe being the saviour for our energy needs, apparently the success rate off the Irish coast in terms of drilling for oil and gas being so small is part of the reason it has not happened already.  That has to be thrown into the argument as well.<\/p> <p>  On the international scale and what we are already seeing in Pakistan, where tens of millions have displaced, and in the Horn of Africa, where we are seeing extreme drought brought about by climate change - there is no denying that - there seems to be a news cycle where events like those in Pakistan happen, they make headlines, and maybe not even headlines sometimes, and then drop off the media.  The same happens with the Horn of Africa, and the same with any of the events we have seen in Germany or with wildfires.  What do we need to do to keep these events in the mind's eye of the public so that they do not become part of the news cycle where we see an extreme event and it drops off, it happens again and it drops off?

It is a very important point, and I will be brief on account of time.  One of the reasons we talk so much about the figures, about the numbers of contributions for things like climate finance, and about the ask for loss and damage funding is because it is supposed to consistent, adequate, and predictable.  What we have at the moment is an <i>ad hoc<\/i>sticking plaster system, where there will be a disaster somewhere like Pakistan, as the Deputy mentions, members of the Government and civil society in that country will be on the BBC World Service, and people will mobilise to try to provide some resources depending on what is available and depending on the level of media and public attention.  That is not how this should be done.  The ask from civil society, from our partners in the global south, and from the vast majority of global south delegates at COP in Egypt in two weeks' time will be for a loss and damage finance facility that will be contributed to on an equity justice basis by this part of the world to ensure that money is there to meet the challenges the Deputy has mentioned and without relying on a media cycle level of attention.  That is why the money is important, but what has been committed already in climate finance and what has been called for in terms of loss and damage needs to be stable, adequate and predictable.  That is how we get away from this cyclical response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Neill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I add one comment in support of what Mr. O'Neill has said.

That is very useful and very important.  I want to stick with the example of Pakistan and use it as a way of teasing out a couple of arguments.  First, we know that 33 million people were directly affected by the flooding there, in a country that is responsible for 0.04% of emissions.  I have figures here, I think from Oxfam, that show that a UN humanitarian appeal for the floods was set at $472 million.  That is just over 1% of what is needed.  The costs of the flooding were around $30 billion.  We have a huge hole to fill and that is just one country.  That is leaving aside the tragedy of the Horn of Africa, which Ms Wathuti talked about earlier.  One of the witnesses has said the funding needs to be stable, adequate, and predictable.  I get that the loss and damage finance is a permanent structure we need to put in place, but is there also a case for calling for a cancellation of the debt of these countries and pushing Ireland to lead on that?  The IMF, which is no stranger to Ireland, will loan money to Pakistan in this particular case and to other poor countries, but it will require severe austerity measures to be imposed on the basis of that loan.  As we know, austerity weakens the internal services and public equality that can be distributed through education, health etc.  Cancelling the debt is one call that should go out at COP, and the other is for a windfall tax on the profits of the fossil fuel industries.  Mr. McEvilly has just described what is going on, and it is outrageous, particularly since the war in Ukraine.  The profits have gone through the roof for all of the big fossil fuel industries.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.  My final question is a little provocative but I really am concerned that COP27 is taking place in one of the most brutal dictatorships on the planet.<\/p><p>In the past ten years, Sisi's Government has built over a dozen extra prisons.  Tens of thousands of activists, including climate and justice activists, are locked up permanently in prison.  Many have to go on hunger strike to draw attention to their plight.  It seems contradictory that we can go to a country that is so brutally guilty of injustice, inhumanity and climate damage and say here we are now, greenwashing a dictator who is going to advocate for justice and climate justice.  It cannot be separated from the question of human rights - I think we would all agree on that.  The boycott is not going to happen, but at a minimum, can we get our delegates to scream about this and draw attention to it inside the conference centre and not give Sisi a free ride while this green preening happens on the side of the Red Sea?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#E01200","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for bringing up the human rights issue.  It is something we have discussed in detail in Oxfam Ireland and across our international organisation.  The next COP is going to be in the United Arab Emirates, UAE and similar objections may apply there.  We have a protest movement called the climate caravan which we are supporting across Africa in 22 different countries and is going to end up at the conference.  Without giving too much away, it will seek to raise publicity on all of these issues, beginning with climate justice.  We have tried as much as possible as an organisation to hand over agency to the African activists on the ground.  The committee heard Ms Wathuti's opening statement today - she represents everything we are trying to do as an organisation, which is to give leadership to African and global south voices to carry out their agency in all of these areas.  It is a UN conference; we cannot control where it is held.  A decision is made by all of our organisations about what level to engage.  The fact that it is being brought up at political level here is the right thing.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to IMF debt and Pakistan, as the Deputy mentioned, he is correct that they now have to resume an IMF loan of $1 billion as a result of the floods.  That is exactly what we are trying to get away from.  There are a number of means of doing that.  Given the context of the last couple of years, from the pandemic to the current crisis, we have called for the cancellation of debts in 2022 and 2023 so countries can get on with trying to recover in general.<\/p> <p>  There was also a question about special drawing rights, which are a form of currency issued by the IMF.  One of the points of the rights is that they can pay off debt.  It was a great campaign last year when we were at COP26 in Glasgow.  I had a detailed discussion with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, about it.  It has fallen off the agenda.  It is a mystery that it has, because at first we were talking about issuing $3 trillion of those rights across the world - the development community as a whole was behind it.  It has fallen off the agenda; it was reduced to $650 billion.  Ireland received $4.5 billion of these special drawing rights.  The idea was that we would try to allocate them to developing countries.  It would be a good question to ask the Minister about what happened the reallocation of the special drawing rights and if they could be a means for debt cancellation and funding loss and damage in an immediate sense.  I hope that answers the question to some extent about debt and the IMF.<\/p> <p>  The windfall tax is something Oxfam has led on and it continues to do so.  There are significant revenues across the world to be made from the windfall profits being made by energy companies.  Along with wealth taxes, it is a way of addressing our inequality crisis, which is a huge contributor to the climate emergency, as proven by the carbon emission figures for the richest 1% of society.  It is also a means of addressing immediate crises like this in order to raise revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Murtagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Our guests online may use the raise hand function if they want to come in on a particular question.

We need to switch that power balance and the model.  It is crucial that this finance is under the UNFCCC for reasons of accountability and transparency.  There is a limit to humanitarian responses.  While they are crucial - we need life-saving responses - they are short term.  We need to look at loss and damage because that is medium term and long term.  It is the question of when someone is displaced, what happens to them.  Where do they find a home?  We can give the immediate relief, but we need long-term structured approaches to people who are dealing with the realities of loss and damage.  Transparency and accountability are key because the position of Ireland at the moment is that there are existing financial flows that need to be used.

I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on that matter.<\/p> <p>  Even if the EU was to withdraw as a bloc, there are concerns about the Energy Charter Treaty secretariat and its expansion into the global south.  A number of African countries such as Burundi, Eswatini and Mauritania are at the ratification process, while Niger, Chad, Gambia, Nigeria and Senegal are at accession stage.  The Energy Charter Treaty is actively targeting Kenya as a member country.  The long-term viability of the Energy Charter Treaty and the predatory nature of going into the global south while the global north might protect themselves and leave and protect themselves from ISDS challenges is an issue.

There are grounds for Ireland to exit the treaty on an earlier basis.<\/p><p>The core point is that the modernisation process, to the best of our knowledge, has not addressed the fundamental risks raised by Senator Boylan about the ISDS.

On the one hand this links in with the core reasons for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, one of which is equity.  It would require developed countries to take the lead in the fossil fuels phase-out given that less developed countries are not responsible and, naturally, are continually in the process of trying to catch up with more developed countries.  We urge less developed countries not to welcome the Energy Charter Treaty but we must be mindful that the onus is on developed countries, particularly the EU and Ireland to take the lead in, at the very least, significantly questioning and critiquing the modernisation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the issue of loss and damage.

These challenges and disasters require immediate support and that is why we are saying we need to ensure our leaders agree on the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility, but also agree on the governance and structure this kind of facility would have to ensure the finance reaches the front-line communities.

How do we bring that level of accountability?  One of the things I would be keen to see is a law on ecocide in order to hold countries, corporations and individuals to account at a global level for any damage they cause to the environment.

The key point is that any legal measures must be used as a driver of action.<\/p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's first question, it is important.  One of the things we have seen as a development organisation following the question of finance and the global justice angle for many years, is that there was a commitment of US$100 billion on climate finance I spoke about and a large amount of that money went either on loans or to try to mobilise private actors.  We see this tendency to hope that a market-based approach - if we can just leverage enough investors - will hit our target.  That is the wrong perspective to take on this.  We have worked with communities and partners in South Sudan to build dykes to assist communities after devastating flooding.  It is difficult to convince private investors to invest in that because there is no return.  If a market-based approach is taken, the poorest communities are left behind.<\/p> <p>  The same principle applies to loss and damage.  There is a tendency to think insurance will fix it but our experience with insurance in the countries we work in is that it is often inadequate, is very lengthy and rarely pays out what it ought to.  Individuals here can think of the experiences they might have had trying to ring insurance companies about a lost suitcase.  Imagine trying to do that while a third of the country is under water.  The public provision of climate finance and loss and damage funding is the most accountable, direct and important source we have.  The temptation is to hope private investment or insurance companies will make up the gap, but while it is important that money flows in the right direction, it will not get us out of the responsibility governments in this part of the world have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Neill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>It is also important to note that Ireland can play a role in this.

As we sit here, the UN treaty negotiations to regulate transnational corporations are taking place.  Part of that draft treaty considers inclusion of free prior informed consent, FPIC which relates to corporate harm in communities.  We can build accountability for corporations into existing frameworks of legally binding regulation.  We need to draw those links.  Also at EU level, environmental and due diligence legislation is being proposed through a new directive within which companies would be required to develop climate or carbon emission plans.  At the moment these provisions lack teeth perhaps so these areas could be improved.

Neither did they short-list further offshore exploration.  Broadly speaking, they rejected these options for two reasons.  First, because of the risk of emissions lock-in, which I mentioned, given our climate obligations.  The second reason was that there are major question marks as to what level of security they would actually bring.  In the case of commercial LNG, the question is whether the tankers actually would arrive on time.  In the case of exploration, members all know well the significant doubts and uncertainty around further offshore development.  We would wholeheartedly agree with those two conclusions in the short-listing.<\/p> <p>  The energy security review independent analysis does short-list a State-backed floating LNG plant and the potential for gas storage.  There are two points here.  First, we would have major concerns around any form of LNG and not only because of that emissions lock-in risk.  The consultants have raised the point that if it is State-backed, it could theoretically be used less and only used for emergency purposes.  However, this does not get away from the risk of fracked gas imports.  The most developed project in this case has been proposed by US developers.  As I understand the majority of those exports come from fracked gas, it does not overcome that risk either.  On gas storage, we could have a lengthy debate about the ins and outs of it and whether offshore or onshore is better but in a point that is broader than the development of fossil fuel infrastructure, it is crucial that where new infrastructure is planned domestically, it has to align in the first instance with climate obligation.   It needs to be very clear how the fossil fuel supplies, in this case, will not lock in emissions.  That analysis needs to be done in the first instance and if it was to be used temporarily - this is crucial - it would need to be absolutely clear that it could only be used with clear obligations, temporarily.  Broadly speaking, the case for further fossil fuel infrastructure has not been clearly made in the analysis that is in that consultation paper.

That represents a shift.  A little more attention is being paid to the perspective we are trying to bring today.  The test is that when you leave this road and get to the difficult stuff, such as the national carbon budget, do you raise it then?  Do you raise it or is there a retrenchment into purely domestic politics and where the burden falls on this island, which is, of course, extremely important?  The global justice perspective often gets lost at that point.  It is heard at a committee meeting, specifically with development or international organisations, but is it there when the rubber really meets the road?  I recall the testimony of Professor Kevin Anderson before this committee in January or February.  Professor Anderson highlighted the uncomfortable truth that those carbon budgets, while extraordinarily challenging and more ambitious than anything that has gone before, are still far more than our fair share of the remaining global carbon budget.  However, that perspective was barely present when the rubber met the road in the context of votes in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p> There are two operative questions to ask.  Are we going to eat up more than our fair share of the remaining global carbon budget, as has happened for the past 100 years?  The answer is \"Yes\".  Are we providing the finance that has been promised, and is required in order to ensure that the burden does not fall on the world's poorest?  As of yet, the answer is \"No\".  These are the two crucial tests and they matter much more than any rhetoric.  It is in the financial budgets and the carbon budgets that the real priorities lie.  We commend the committee on giving us the chance to make this presentation and giving space to this angle, but please reflect it in the votes in the Chamber, because that is what really matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Neill.

We need to recognise that investment of this nature is required or else we will see migration on a massive scale that will be bad for everyone.

I worry about hoisting very rigid policies that, unfortunately, become very difficult to implement and about mobilising public support for them.  That is something I, as a former Minister, grapple with.  I see things slightly differently from the witnesses' perspective.  They say that Ireland should reach net zero by 2029 in order that we might have a good chance of keeping global temperatures down.  If they are advocating that we adopt very rigid positions around certain things, we will lose the room.  It is really important that we find a way of mobilising people.  The decisions we have taken are going to be really difficult to implement.  As a result, we need to a way of working to deliver these things as well as being aware that we have to continually lift our ambition.

We released a report yesterday, The Cost of Delay, which is a historical look at loss and damage as an issue and which looks back three decades.  The report was issued in conjunction with the Loss and Damage Collaboration, so most people here would have received it.  Loss and damage was first asked for in 1991 by small island states at a UN framework convention.  In that year, more than 150,000 people died because of extreme weather events.  The states in question made a push for it at that stage - 30 years ago - and it was rebuffed.  You can look at years of pushes for loss and damage at COP.  It was rebuffed again as a funded facility at COP14 in 2008, when, again, over 150,000 people were killed directly by extreme weather events.  It was cyclones in that case, in places like Bangladesh and Myanmar.  When it comes to this year, we see another push.  This year, we come to COP27, following the floods in Pakistan and the Horn of Africa crisis, which is a conflict as well as being climate related above all.  Are we going to be rebuffed again?  Do we know how many people have died because of extreme weather events this year when we count the Horn of Africa crisis and the floods in Pakistan?  The global justice case for this is beyond dispute.  We argue that the time for quiet diplomacy on this issue is over.  We need to move and publicly state our support for a loss and damage facility based on the principles of global justice, which Deputy Bruton mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#J02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Murtagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Does Mr. MacEvilly want to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#J02200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I will try to take each of Deputy Bruton's points in turn.  On the issue of support for continuing with fossil fuels, in particular for storage, it is very important to distinguish between immediate pressures on certain EU states as the result of loss of Russian supplies and long-term support for fossil fuels.<\/p><p>There is a continuous tendency in the Oireachtas to conflate gas and electricity security when they are not the same.  On the broader EU perspective, one of the major reasons we are in this crisis is that decisions were taken at EU level five or seven years ago to invest further in gas, causing us to rely more on Russian gas rather than setting greater energy efficiency targets.  We have continuously failed to have a grown-up discussion on demand reduction measures.  <\/p><p> On the issue of subsidisation, I fully agree with Mr. Murtagh's points on the need to distinguish the types of subsidies but we have to be clear that this is not about a call to suddenly switch off some individual subsidy, particularly one of those subsidies for those most at risk.  The issue is that Ireland has failed to even commence or produce a review of its subsidies, despite committing to do so years ago.  We are at the very beginning here.  This has been continuously called for. <\/p><p> On the issue of public support, I fully support the need to bring citizens with us and the challenge that presents but Friends of the Earth has done polling and, to give just one example, three times as many people support renewables as support the introduction of LNG.  The Environmental Protection Agency has done fantastic in-depth surveys on public attitudes towards climate action on renewables.  I question any sort of belief that there may not be general public support.<\/p><p> On the issue of rigid positions, while it is extremely challenging to suddenly take an immediate and rigid decision on fossil fuels, the example in this area is, of course, Covid-19.  When the risks were explained to citizens, we found that quite harsh measures were not only readily accepted by citizens but were more actively supported than by some parts of Government.<\/p><p> On the day-to-day reality, I will give a very brief example relating to the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.  Back in the 1960s, when issues around nuclear disarmament were coming to the fore, there was a general understanding that nuclear weapons were needed as a result of the Cold War and so on.  Ireland took the lead in tabling resolutions at the United Nations on the need for an end to nuclear weapons and for disarmament given the risks they posed not only to Ireland, but to the world.  That shifted the narrative and the understanding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#J02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I will respond to a couple of things Deputy Bruton said.  Support for loss and damage finance funding is brilliant and we really welcome it.  We have been looking at this over a number of months and the question is whether any EU state will step out in front of the common position.  Denmark has done so.  A key ask of this committee, and particularly of Deputies and Senators of the Government parties, is to raise this with the Minister so that we can, as Mr. Murtagh said, not be the first, but the second.<\/p> <p>  On the question of energy and the political reality, I recognise the political reality Deputy Bruton is describing.  None of us think for a second that any of this is anything other than extraordinarily challenging.  That is just a reflection of the position we are in.  However, we also recognise the scientific reality.  If those two things are not coherent with one another at the moment, we have to ask which is more mutable, the scientific reality or the political reality.  The latter is often assumed to be more fixed than it is.  Mr. McEvilly was spot-on in raising the example of Covid.  What we had there was an emergency response.  Politicians, the Civil Service and the public acted as if there was an emergency and the operation of the State and our society shifted to rise to the challenge.  We did exceptionally well.  However, there is not that sense of an emergency about this.  We are still treating it as just another policy position to be talked about just as we talk about education, housing and healthcare when holding debates and discussing Bills.  This is different.  I fully appreciate where Deputy Bruton is coming from and that he is speaking in good faith but the question is which of the scientific reality and the political reality we can change, even if it is extraordinarily hard.  In my view, it is the latter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The witnesses' testimonies and debate have been really powerful.  On loss and damage, it is important that we do not have a situation in which we are choosing between supporting a loss and damage facility and leading the way.  Will the witnesses confirm that by taking the lead, as Denmark has done in taking an individual position and recognising that historic responsibility and committing, we would be supporting debate on a loss and damage facility and helping to push the EU position in a positive way?  It is important both to support a loss and damage facility in the negotiations and to take an individual stance.<\/p> <p>  I was very struck by what Ms Wathuti said about what is happening, which was very powerful.  It is a good reality check.  We hear a lot about the costs and difficulties associated with climate action and what it does to different business models, about how we have done things and about how difficult it is to change but we have now heard about how the cost of inaction and slow action on climate is far more severe.  It is not simply a matter of businesses failing, but of death, loss of life, farming and food security around the world.  That is really important.  Will the witnesses elaborate on what slowing or delaying climate action means for food security worldwide?<\/p> <p>  On that loss and damage facility, the loss of lives and livelihoods is understandably at centre stage.  However, will the witnesses comment on the cultural and biodiversity loss that is also part of the loss for many countries and on the importance of that being recognised?<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of trust.  How fundamental is emerging with a loss and damage facility to the trust of the more than 100 countries across the world that have been calling for this and that were frustrated at the last Conference of the Parties?<\/p> <p>  On the question of climate financing, I am struck by the issues of quality and quantity.  With regard to quality, what should or could Ireland do to press the EU on the quality of climate financing?  I am particularly struck by the idea that we could be asking countries to go into debt for damage we have done, a point that was beautifully made by Deputy Cronin.  An approach to some of these issues that is based on debt or loans is wrong.  Also mentioned was the danger of public money being used solely to underwrite or incentivise private commercial investment when there is a great public need that is not profitable to meet but that must be met to ensure the maintenance of life and social cohesion across the world.  I refer to the importance of public money going to those worst affected through loss and damage and other climate grant financing rather than simply being used to underwrite private investment.

When we come in here, we try to give constructive criticism and highlight the areas where we need to do more and need to do better, but it is also important to recognise the quality aspect, as outlined in the statement.  We can always do better in this sense, but relative to what we are seeing in other European countries, Ireland is definitely a leader.  The message will be to hold and maintain that.  Countries like France, for example, have provided a lot of money through loans, and we have discussed how inadequate and unjust that is.  Ireland has a role to protect the model that we have developed, to strengthen it and to urge other EU states to follow.  The quality piece is very important.<\/p><p> In terms of our fair share, the estimate we have given here is &euro;545 million per year.  The target, pushed out to 2025, is &euro;225 million.  The committee can see that we have some way to go.  As I mentioned earlier, the budgets, both carbon and financial, are where the rubber meets the road.  The academic research backing up those estimates is footnoted and referenced in the statement.<\/p><p> On the question of trust, I do not think one could pick a better word to describe the dynamic as it was at COP in Glasgow and how it will be in Egypt on this question.  In fact, a huge amount of the nationally determined contributions - the national plans submitted by every country that is a party to the treaty &ndash; from the global south have an asterisk, as they are conditional on receiving the funding that has been promised but has not been delivered.  If anyone wants to be more cynical about it, there is a self-interest here: providing this finance is not just a moral obligation, it makes it more likely that everyone in the world will be able to get their emissions down, and we would all benefit.<\/p><p> On the fair share of the remaining global carbon budget, we mentioned it before, but Senator Higgins is right to re-emphasise it.  I think it might have been in this committee or it could have been in the Seanad that it was called a forum of carbon colonialism.  Christian Aid would throw its support behind that assessment because in the context of the global carbon budget, to date, it has been this part of the world that has eaten the vast majority of it.  Based on the current plans, we are going to keep doing that.  I will repeat those two questions.  Are we overeating our fair share emissions-wise?  Are we providing our fair share in terms of finance?

In terms of loss and damage, the critical issue will be to home in on the finance facility.  Mr. Murtagh documented the extent of the obstruction over the years.  For 30 years, different reasons have been given as to why finance cannot be provided.  At this point, even within the EU, more countries concede that there is a gap in loss and damage finance.  What they are not agreeing to is a specific, transparent, accountable facility under the UNFCCC, which is what developing countries are calling for.  It is important that we home in on that detail.<\/p> <p>  The finance needs to be unlocked in order that we might have those critical discussions on non-economic loss and damage, erosion of biodiversity and so on.  Ireland is doing some work in exploring these issues with the Overseas Development Institute and has facilitated a number of workshops in this regard, which we welcome.<\/p> <p>  The overwhelming message from COP26 was that trust had been broken.  Promises were made about the provision of $100 billion, which is not even enough, but that has not been delivered.  It is being delivered primarily through loans rather than through adaptation and grants.  There is a feeling that trust keeps being eroded.  Trust must be rebuilt at COP27.<\/p> <p>  The final point I will make relates to a fair share of climate finance.  It is important to note that the commitments made by Ireland for &euro;225 million to be delivered by 2025 are welcome, but we must put these in context.  That money part of the $100 billion promise, which was supposed to be delivered by 2020.  At COP26, there was an acknowledgement by richer countries that this money would be delivered by 2023.  What we have is a promise by Ireland to deliver by 2025.  It is already late.  The message is that there is an urgent need to scale up our finance swiftly.  The year 2025 is a late deadline.  We must look at our fair share.  The work that we have done estimates our fair share to be approximately &euro;500 million, which is much higher than the &euro;225 million target.

We must remember that we have set in law that it will be 2050 at the latest.  It will identify what is required across all sectors of the Irish economy to get us there.  It gives us a true long-term plan.  Together with the updated climate action plan, they will be two extremely powerful tools for climate action in Ireland.  The LTS is also a very important mechanism to ensure that the EU achieves its collective net-zero goal.  It allows for checks and balances to ensure that Ireland makes the appropriate and fair contribution to meeting the goal.  It is more transparent.

The point in regard to Covid is well made.  Even during that time, however, we had a lack of sharing of vaccines globally.

Ms Wathti said that lasting damage will become the defining issue of this COP, but it was, in a sense, the position with COP26 as well.

That is a major risk.  It is not lost on us that Sharm El-Sheikh is a holiday resort.  It is very likely that civil society in Africa will find it hugely challenging to attend and be there.  The oppression of human rights defenders was mentioned previously.  The context of this COP at Sharm El-Sheikh is very different.<\/p> <p>  In terms of wider publicity, the public understand the climate justice message to the effect that Ireland failing to act is both unjust and stands to hurt those most at risk and least responsible.  I am also struck by the fact that many of the most important climate action measures that would have the biggest impacts in reducing emissions fundamentally improve quality of life.  I will not lecture the committee on it, but when it comes to transport and energy efficiency, we are all very much aware that these are the real measures that people want.  There is an opportunity to link climate mitigation and quality-of-life messages, as well as Mr. O'Neill's central point that this is not a climate inconvenience; it is a climate crisis.  We cannot treat as this as another simple policy question.  I fully agree with the point around the need for Members of the Oireachtas to really bring these interests and decisions into question in the context of the budget and legislation.<\/p> <p>  What is needed from Government right now is implementation.  While it might be understood very well by this committee, it is not simply the responsibility of the Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications to deliver every single climate action measure.  As we have just heard, the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs have a central role to play in climate finance.  That is equally true across a plethora of sectoral climate issues.  There needs to be much more focus, scrutiny and responsibility placed on other Oireachtas committees, Departments and public bodies in delivering on those commitments.  Indeed, many of the major obstacles we have encountered have been with other Government bodies.  Needless to say, this committee has a central role going forward in providing accountability and in acting like the Committee of Public Accounts in the context of public finances and holding Departments to account.

I totally recognise the challenge that the Chairman highlighted.  It is not too dissimilar to that highlighted by Deputy Bruton.  That is the challenge for the 220-odd people who are lucky enough to be Members of this Parliament.  They have to try to reconcile those political differences.  There is a deep bedrock of internationalism in Ireland that is not always evident elsewhere in the world.  It is one of the reasons that we have such a good reputation in the provision of aid, for example.  There are a lot of organisations and people here who really care about the bigger picture.  That is something that we can draw on.  On the flip side, the challenge I would put to the politicians is that when it gets to that micro level and some decision in a constituency or at a local level, they should reject the obvious cynical move of using it as an opportunity to fight with another party.  It does sometimes happen that the easiest thing in the world to do is to point out what is difficult.  Much of what we are talking about here is going to require a critical mass of politicians to say things that are hard.  It was the same during the pandemic.  It would have been easy enough to put our fingers in our ears, but we did not do that.  I would hope that the fact that the news we have seen, not just from Pakistan and east Africa but also across the European Continent this summer, including wildfires and the impact they had, is something that will hopefully help the penny to drop here that we need to play our part.

What the Chairman has described is not what we see in our polls or even in the local community.  Oxfam Ireland is based in Ringsend and there is a huge willingness to engage on issues like district heating or retrofitting.  There is a real appetite for that in the community.  There is also a very quick understanding of the national and global injustices and inequalities that come with this issue.  Oxfam has used the statistic more than anyone else that the richest 1% of the world's population is responsible for twice the emissions of the bottom half of humanity which is the 4 billion people who contribute very little to emissions.  We have seen that research reflected in Ireland where the top 10% is responsible for more than 50% of the emissions.  That is why Oxfam promotes ideas like windfall and wealth taxes to address that inequality.  We have seen in our polling a sense of despondency as people rate climate change at the top of their agenda but feel a sense of powerlessness.  That is why I have approached Members like Deputy Whitmore to see if we could generate a flow of questions from local communities on what happens at a local level and that information could be fed to this committee and we could get responses from the Government on those issues.<br\/><br\/>Finally, on the question of inequality, many of the members will know of the French economist Thomas Piketty.  He and another French researcher have produced a book titled <i>The Elephant Curve of Global Inequality and Growth<\/i>, which shows on the curve that climate guilt is sometimes an issue.  It shows that from 1990 to more or less the present working class and middle class people in rich countries have reduced their emissions so created the bottom part of the curve.  However, where the curve rises again like an elephant's trunk is the emissions of the super rich and extremely wealthy.  That is not just in terms of their luxury jets and holiday homes but also in their investments in fossil fuel industries and so on.  It is a question of having justice at that level at both the level of consumption and investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Murtagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The 2019 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is the predecessor of this committee, has a chapter on climate communications with recommendations to Government and I would hazard a guess that it is still relevant.

Its foreign minister and the president-designate of COP27, Sameh Shoukry, has pointed out that the African continent is the party most affected by the negative repercussions of climate change despite contributing least to emissions.  Therefore, Egypt has emphasised that COP27 will be \"an African COP\" placing adaptation at the forefront, while recognising that a just transition remains a priority for developing countries worldwide.  As we move closer to COP, loss and damage discussions are increasingly coming to the fore as developing countries set high expectations for progress on finance for loss and damage due to the adverse effects of climate change.  Climate finance, in particular adaptation finance, will also be a priority, both in terms of developed countries catching up on the missed target of $100 billion by 2020, but also agreeing the implications and process to double adaptation finance by 2025 as well as commencing discussions to determine the post-2025 climate finance goal for the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>  Ireland looks forward to a comprehensive and balanced outcome from COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh.  I will highlight a few of the priorities the Irish delegation will be focusing on in the negotiations.  Climate-induced loss and damage is a key priority for Ireland's work on climate change.  Parties urgently need to scale up and improve access to climate finance to avert, minimise and address the loss and damage currently facing communities in countries most vulnerable to climate change.  Ireland will continue to engage constructively in the Glasgow dialogues on loss and damage and explore concrete solutions and frameworks to assist those in need.  To avoid exacerbating existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, Ireland's financial support is overwhelmingly grant-based and emphasises sectors that are of most relevance to the poorest, such as agriculture and food security, energy and social protection.  At COP26 we also committed to more than double our funding for developing countries to tackle climate change by 2025, rising from &euro;93 million to &euro;225 million over the next four years, which Ireland's recently published international climate finance roadmap sets out with clear, time-bound items to be delivered.<\/p> <p>  The \"African COP\", as the Egyptian presidency has described it, is taking place in the context of devastating droughts and failed rainy seasons.  We recognise that such climate extremes are a threat to food production systems and water security, and that food production needs to be resilient and environmentally sustainable.  Challenging discussions, particularly on loss and damage, are anticipated.  Developing countries have made it clear they expect a finance facility for loss and damage to be established.  In practical terms, there must be an agenda item on the issue at COP27 for this to happen.  The EU position on loss and damage is evolving and we are centrally involved in this process.<\/p> <p>  In discussions to date, the EU has focused on strengthening and scaling up support, including financial support, for existing institutions and initiatives that assist vulnerable communities.  Reservations remain about creating a new, potentially duplicate financing facility, given that some mechanisms already exist which partially fund loss and damage, such as the Green Climate Fund.  The EU sees the Glasgow dialogue, which is under way, as a valuable space with relevant stakeholders to discuss and plan financing on this area further.<\/p> <p>  Ireland also recognises the negative impacts that short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, can have on the climate and air quality and ,in turn, acknowledges the threat posed to health, especially in urban areas.  Ireland is committed to advancing work on short-lived climate pollutants, including through the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and our continued support of policy based on the best available science.  We look forward to engaging with our EU colleagues in the second technical dialogue of the global stocktake, which brings all parties together to reflect on best practices and lessons learned in our implementation of the Paris Agreement, to strengthen our efforts.<\/p> <p>  Recognising that the voices of the most affected are those that should be amplified and receive greatest attention in such dialogues and beyond, we will continue to promote the participation of representatives of least developed countries and small island developing states, including through financial support to non-governmental organisations.<\/p> <p>  We are committed to the Paris Agreement as the primary multilateral mechanism to drive global climate action.  Recent IPCC reports demonstrate that national efforts alone are not enough.  International co-operation through strong institutions is essential.<\/p> <p>  Significant progress was made at COP26 in Glasgow last year, with the international community coming together at an unprecedented level.  However, the geopolitical context has changed radically since then, with the war in Ukraine often knocking climate change down the agenda.  The Russian Federation's unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine has exacerbated the imperative for Europe to end its dependency on imported gas to heat homes and power industries.  Ireland supports the Egyptian presidency in its view that the energy and food crises fuelled by the war in Ukraine are an unacceptable pretext for backsliding at this COP.<\/p> <p>  To address all these issues, we must rediscover the spirit, energy and hope from COP21, where 192 countries created the Paris Agreement, and bring that same unity of purpose to the table at Sharm el-Sheikh.  The UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, said we need \"a coalition of the world\" to tackle the challenges ahead.  I would expand that by stressing the importance of civil society, youth, scientists and other non-party stakeholders in that coalition.  Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, continues to make that point clear to the Egyptian presidency.  We continue to advocate for COPs to be transparent and inclusive for all, in particular the active participation of women and young people in negotiations and the facilitation of civil society attendance and engagement.<\/p> <p>  It is clear we face many challenges in the coming weeks, but there is room for hope if all parties come together to develop and agree concrete, sustainable solutions.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will work collaboratively with all parties in preparing for and framing the nature of the debate and will work as part of the EU team to bring countries together to agree a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced outcome taking forward co-ordinated climate action, remaining true to the Paris Agreement and keeping 1.5&deg; alive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Mr. McLoughlin said Ireland supports the Egyptian presidency in its view that the energy and food crises fuelled by the war in Ukraine are an unacceptable pretext for backsliding at COP.

Energy acceleration is key to energy security, not fossil fuels, especially for Europe.  However, increasingly, countries are being faced with difficult choices in this space.  Overall emissions are not increasing.  Long term trends see decreases and this accelerated shift needs to be maintained.  The geopolitical situation we are facing forces us to reassess how we achieve our longer term transition to climate neutrality, which is not only essential to our environment but is also key to our growth strategy.  The path to zero is predicated among other things on ample availability of affordable gas, and that is now a thing of the past.  This is a moment to break through rather than backslide, particularly on renewables and energy efficiency on coal phase-out to peak gas earlier than we would have without the war.<\/p> <p>  The question facing us is whether we can create a public debate and public awareness around COP.  On fossil fuel language, for instance, can we create positive messages on renewables?  All parties and governments must make short-term compromises on energy.  Ireland and the EU are committed to adhering to our emissions cap and carbon budgets.  Most important is that overall emissions do not increase.  As I said, there is a long-term trend that can see a decrease.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has upended global politics and the market.  This is first and foremost a humanitarian tragedy which also has profound effects on the price and security of energy and food globally.  High volatile oil and gas prices are now driving inflation and the cost-of-living crisis throughout the world, and are exposing the true cost of our dependency on oil and gas as never before.  Governments have a responsibility to ensure reliable and affordable energy services for their populations and their economies.  We believe the best way to deliver this while creating jobs and lowering the long-term cost of energy is to increase massively investment in energy efficiency, renewable energy and the resilience and flexibility of our energy systems.<\/p><p>Ireland stands firmly for that in the forthcoming negotiations on climate and energy security.<\/p><p> We are not in favour governments turning off the taps overnight.  We accept that there are limited increases in production from the existing oil and gas capacity and that might be necessary in the current context but certainly issuing new oil and gas licences for fields that take years to come online will do nothing do solve the current crisis.  In fact, the contrary is the case.  Decisions carry a long-term risk of stranded assets and carbon lock-in.  Leadership on a managed phase-out of fossil fuels and our vision of a world beyond oil and gas, which was amplified by our membership of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance last year, is urgently needed.  Ahead of COP, developed countries with greater financial and technical capacity must really lead the way on this and support developing countries in their transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

To what extent can that gain momentum?  Probably for the first time ever, the public is listening and there is an opportunity.  The EU has set a 10% reduction, which is voluntary, and a 5% reduction at peak use - 10% reduction in gas.  The French are talking about sobriety, as they put it.

In the context of Ireland's profile, we have been one of the early movers on this.  Last year, at COP26, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced new funding to operate the Santiago Network, which is a loss and damage facility that catalyses the deployment of expertise, etc., to regions facing this crisis.  We are an early mover, and our entire aid profile and the way it is underpinned by humanitarian instincts in the first place speaks to the fact that loss and damage is an issue and is recognised as such.<\/p> <p>  Officially, perhaps for the first time, we saw conclusions emerge from the Environment Council yesterday.  There was recognition that loss and damage needs to be on the agenda and recognition that these losses are real and need to be addressed.  How they are going to be addressed is the subject of very difficult discussions at Sharm el-Sheikh.  The discussion that we have been having entirely as part of the EU working group preparing for COP27, where a number of different approaches to the issue have been advocated.  Ireland has experts in the various expert groups feeding in possible options with respect to approaches that can be taken to loss and damage in the context of the Glasgow dialogue, which was really necessary to create the space for discussions on how funding can be channelled to those in the greatest need.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned some backsliding in the context of finance.  Ireland's total climate finance for 2020 was &euro;88 million.  For 2021, indicative figures confirm an increase.  These figures are submitted to the European Commission reporting system.  They are not yet publicly available.  They could be subject to minor changes.  It is important to note there was a change in the methodology for counting and reporting Ireland's international climate finance which has taken effect since the publication of the 2019 report.  It is in line with the EU regulation of the governance of the Energy Union and climate action which came into force in 2020.  According to the previous methodology there Ireland's total climate finance would have been nearly &euro;92 million in 2020.  There are underlying factors.  Applying the new methodology, Ireland's climate finance is approximately &euro;88 million which represented a reduction of about &euro;5.7 million.  The decrease is mostly explained by the impact of Covid-19 in 2020 on programming and the delivery of planned activities.  The changed methodology had the largest impact on the Department of Foreign Affairs climate finance spend due to the nature of real marking across bilateral NGO programming.  There was a technical aspect there and our commitment to providing appropriate levels of climate finance was really crystalised by the Taoiseach's announcement at COP last year, which guarantees &euro;225 million by 2025.<\/p> <p>  On energy, the entire crisis has represented an opportunity to engage the public on how we have approached energy previously and how we have over-used.  There is a national campaign, Reduce Your Use, ongoing to get that message across.  There is an opportunity to try to engage the public now while more than ever everyone is considering the costs associated with their consumption.  Every opportunity we have to engage the public on this and more broadly on climate is very welcome.

There are opportunities here to look at whether there is potential for carbon market transactions for solidarity fund levies, etc., on profits from fossil fuel fuels and so forth.  These still take time to put in place.  Obviously, further analysis is required in terms of such negotiations, including how it might affect the carbon border adjustment mechanism, the European Union Solidarity Fund, etc.  They are also mentioned in the context of the developed countries admitting that a big part of fossil fuel production is in developing countries.  Further analysis is required there.  As I said, however, absolutely, Ireland is engaging by association with the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance last year and in the context of our preparations for COP27 and how we are negotiating with EU member states.

In the context of COP, since 2012, gender and climate change have been stand-alone agenda items.  Therefore, this is a form of recognition that a gender-responsive approach to climate action reduces the potential for pre-existing equalities to continue in a green transition at a state and smaller-scale project level.  As the Deputy said, this is done through the identification of gaps and needs and the collection of this aggregated data.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, COP25 successfully reviewed and concluded the Lima work programme on gender and adopted an enhanced working programme, as well as a new gender action plan.

Perhaps Mr. McLoughlin could confirm that loss and damage is not in any sense aid.  One of the issues of concern in terms of other aspects of our climate financing is that it is meant to be new and additional.  However, Ireland has described doubling the share of official development assistance, ODA, that could be dedicated to climate action.<\/p><p>It is important to clarify that climate finance is different from aid and, specifically, loss and damage funding is different from, additional to and separate from aid.<\/p><p> On that point about loss and damage, the answer was very unsatisfactory.  There was the idea of having to negotiate as part of the EU but this is not a trade negotiation.  These are negotiations in respect of the UN.  We are part of the EU but also of the UN, and Ireland sought a position, for example, on the Security Council by strongly pitching that we understood and were connected with other countries.  We are also one of the only EU countries with a direct experience of colonialism, which is very relevant in the context of what has been called climate colonialism or carbon colonialism in the using-up of the fair share and the causing of damage to the developing world.<\/p><p> I would like Mr. McLoughlin to confirm that nothing is preventing Ireland from, as Denmark did, playing a role in the EU position, and I would argue that Denmark taking a strong stance probably helped push the Council to improve its position.  There is nothing to prevent Ireland from individually giving recognition through a loss and damage payment while also pushing for a better EU position.  Will Ireland support a loss and damage facility?  This is not a brainstorming of ideas; it has been called for for a long time.  Will we back the 130 countries that have called for that when they call for it again and when that decision point comes, or will we do only what some other countries in the EU are doing, even though some member states such as Denmark are supporting a loss and damage facility?  We need to be clear on this as a committee.  Ireland performing a fabulous secretariat role in the background is meaningless if we do not have a position.<\/p><p> I welcome the fact there is a focus on human rights in what Mr. McLoughlin said.  At previous COP conferences, there was a concerted effort not to refer to human rights in some of the texts, including in areas such as gender.  Will Ireland support better human rights language in what comes through?  Will it sign the declaration on children, youth and climate action that has been developed by YOUNGO, UNICEF and the Children's Environmental Rights Initiative?  Mr. McLoughlin mentioned young people as a focus.  This is a specific opportunity to sign something that will be meaningful, although it would have been better if we had signed it in advance of COP.  Multiple special rapporteurs from the UN Human Rights Council have also highlighted the importance of this.<\/p><p> Ireland signed up to the target of a 30% cut in methane by 2030 last year.  Are we going back to the negotiations and discussions, alongside those with whom we discussed it, with ideas of how Ireland might achieve the 30% cut in methane by 2030 if we have signed up to that?<\/p><p> Beyond oil and gas, a crucial issue that has been emerging relates to the energy charter treaty.

My understanding, from colleagues on the energy side, is that they are awaiting the outcome of the final stages of the modernisation process towards adoption at the energy charter conference, which I think is due to be held in November, while reserving the option to support a co-ordinated withdrawal from the charter should the effort fail, and as considered appropriate by the Government to achieve our national renewable energy and climate ambitions.

That is built not just on what it does but on what it says.  It is important that we use every opportunity to say what it is we mean, particularly around loss and damage.  In negotiations, what you say externally impacts on your ability to get what you want at the negotiating table.  I take the point that in a negotiation you cannot always lay all your cards on the table but in this instance I do not see what we have to lose by saying what we mean around loss and damage.  Those are my main points.  I know we are caught for time.  Much of what has been said is what I was going to say as well.

There have also been moves at the Security Council level, and Ireland has been on that level, around integrating the security risks associated with climate.  I understand if I am not being clear.  Ireland absolutely supports efforts to address loss and damage.  Yesterday, the EU environment ministers agreed the bloc's negotiating position with a call to promptly strengthen existing institutions, provide support and deliver concrete solutions, including through a new agenda item that would make full use of the Glasgow dialogue.  Those conclusions form the basis of our negotiating mandate.  It is through the EU that we are negotiating.  I can only reiterate the steps Ireland has made both in the context of the working parties and in the expert groups informed by representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs. Concrete steps and measures have been taken to bring proposals to really challenge member states in this space.  I assure the committee that Ireland will be among the most ambitious member states.<\/p> <p>  I know what Senator Higgins is saying about Denmark.  If we were to go line by line through the various different funding streams, there is no doubt that we could extract different things some of the funding we have provided, because it is so grant based and because it responds to what is happening on the ground.  There are things in our support for multilateral funds that we could package as loss and damage.  What we are looking for here is to make actual progress.  The world is looking to Sharm El-Sheikh, to COP, for progress in this space.  It will be the defining issue.  If I am reticent about going ahead of other EU member states as we have just reached conclusions around negotiating positions and the work that needs to be undertaken, I apologise.  However, I assure the committee that it is all in the context of trying to ensure we go as a united bloc, to make sure the full weight of the EU can be brought to bear on what will be the most important negotiating at COP.

My question relates to the implications that has or may have in Ireland.  To the best of my knowledge, there are not any projects operating in Ireland that would be impacted by the energy charter treaty as we have not implemented any policies that would prohibit such operators from operating.  Perhaps Mr. McLoughlin could offer some clarity on that.  My related question regarding COP27 is on the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which Ireland was a founding member of, arising from COP26 in Edinburgh.  Will the opportunity be taken at COP27 to raise the profile of that endeavour and the prohibition of further oil and gas exploration in other member states or countries that are in attendance at the conference and future conferences?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022102500002#S00400","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I cannot offer anything further on the energy charter treaty because I do not want to speak for energy colleagues, other than to say we await the outcome of the final stages of the process.  At that point, it will be reviewed.  Regarding our membership of Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, there are any number of initiatives that ministers are invited to sign up to in the context of COP.  The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance was one such initiative led by Denmark and Costa Rica last year.  With a lot of the initiatives, the lack of follow-through can be stark and it speaks to the need to create a programme for what initiatives we lend our weight to.  The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance has stood out in the context of its ongoing engagement with the founding members and with the friends of the alliance  There have been nearly monthly meetings between members and the secretariat, which was also established during the course of the year.  At this year's COP, the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance will have a very visible presence on the ground.  There is a sustained outreach programme to other parties and countries that may wish to receive encouragement in this space, whether through becoming a member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance or through practical measures.  The organisation can contribute to the discussions that may be happening in those countries about their energy profile and whether they will consider banning or introducing limitations on gas and oil exploration.<\/p> <p>  The make-up of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance in the context of COP27 is slightly difficult because the Danish elections are ongoing.  That may have effects for the Danish Ministry.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made the secretariat aware that he is available to support the organisation and to work with potential members as well as new members, which will be unveiled in the context of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance events at COP27.  We look forward to that.  The alliance was also very present at the recent meeting of the UN General Assembly.  It issued a measured and powerful statement about the war in Ukraine, acknowledging the difficulties governments are in at the moment in using short-term solutions.  It also re-emphasised the point that long-term decisions such as recommencing drilling or issuing new licences must be paused and considered in the context of where we need to be going forward with respect to the energy profiles of various other countries.

At its annual congress in 2022 a comprehensive motion was passed on the mental health of primary school children.  Our education consultative conference in 2021 had a focus on well-being and mental health.  Mental health was included as a topic at our equality conference in 2013.<\/p><p> We want the committee to note that the culture in which Irish primary schools operate is one that strives to be safe, healthy and inclusive for all pupils regardless of social background, race, self-identity and learning needs.  Primary teachers are profoundly aware of the importance of the well-being of their pupils.  The challenge of protecting the mental health and well-being of primary school children must not be underestimated.<\/p><p> National research carried out with children and young people by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 2013 suggests that approximately one in three young people will have experienced some type of mental disorder by the age of 13.  This rate rises to more than one in two by the age of 24 years when intervention does not take place.  This is more than 50%.  Research conducted by Dublin City University in 2017 found that the psychological well-being needs of children in primary school are complex.  This research identified a range and severity of difficulties that children present with in primary schools.  It also focused on the varied family and cultural contexts that are a feature of their daily lives.  Critical incidents of a serious nature that schools deal with include separation, divorce, marital breakdown, anxiety, bullying, cyberbullying, self-harm, suicidal ideation, eating disorders and sexual identity issues.  All of these impact on the mental health of children.<\/p><p> Ireland's child and adolescent mental health services are experiencing significant difficulties.  These have been well publicised and include a lack of services at community and school level, difficulties in recruiting qualified staff and excessive waiting lists for specialist mental health treatment services.  School principals have reported wait times of up to four years in some cases.  This is unacceptable and cannot continue. <\/p><p> The service that engages with children on an almost daily basis is the school.  Schools and school personnel must be supported by all other services when nurturing the positive mental health of pupils.  It is acknowledged that our mental health is influenced by our daily lives and that the foundation of good mental health starts in our youth.  In other jurisdictions, schools are recognised as the optimal venue for youth mental health promotion and prevention programmes as they are the only venue where all children and adolescents in society can be reached.  In those jurisdictions mental health professionals work in schools, alongside teachers, to support the mental health of pupils.<\/p><p> The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated stress and anxiety among children.  During school closures some pupils regressed not only in their learning but also in their social and emotional well-being.  Guidance published by the Department of Education in September 2020 advised that well-being be prioritised in our schools.  Teachers recognise the impact the trauma of the pandemic has had and seek increased resources for primary school teachers to adequately support children's mental health in the months and years ahead.<\/p><p> At its congress in April 2022 the INTO noted the dearth of mental health support services for primary school children.  During the debate on children&rsquo;s mental health delegates reported that more and more children present in primary school classrooms experiencing anxiety, poor mental health and poor emotional well-being.  The congress called for increased National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, provision for schools and clarity regarding the level of provision that schools can expect, a national framework to inform the development of counselling services for primary school children and resources to introduce on-site school counselling in primary schools in line with international best practice.  We are delighted to welcome the Minister's recent announcement of &euro;5 million to fund a pilot programme of counselling supports in primary schools.  We look forward to her engagement with stakeholders on the matter.<\/p><p> We note that Government policy dictates that all mental health and other professional services are provided in the community.  There is extensive international research to indicate that services co-located in schools experience a higher level of engagement and success.  We would argue that schools are an integral part of the community of children and families and ask the Government to re-examine and redefine \"community\" in this context.<\/p><p> The INTO recommends that schools are provided with adequate, age-appropriate supports for children presenting with mental health difficulties, increased NEPS provision for schools, the development of a national framework to inform the development of counselling services for primary school children and funding and resources for this.  It also recommends increased funding for child and adolescent mental health services and sufficient up-to-date professional development supports for teachers.  The INTO recognises the urgency in providing mental health supports for primary school pupils, especially at school level.<\/p><p>They must be properly resourced and meet the needs of the school community.  We remain committed to the support of the pupils in our care.<\/p><p> Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gcomhchoiste as ucht &eacute;isteacht liom inni&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>To clarify, Ms Sarah Behan is unwell today.  I am Sarah Hughes, the mental health programme manager.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairperson and members of the Oireachtas committee for the opportunity to speak to the committee today.  I am the mental health programme manager for the Union of Students in Ireland, which is the national student representative body for students in third level education.<\/p> <p>  I want to draw the committee's attention to the current issues we are facing with regard to mental health funding in higher education institutions, HEIs.<\/p> <p>  The current funding allocated to mental heath support in HEIs is not core or multi-annual.  While the extra funding provided for mental health during Covid is greatly welcomed, it only brought the student-to-counsellor ratio to 1:2,500, rather than the best standard practice of 1:1,000.  This funding also only refers to core counselling clinics and does not take other staff, such as GPs, health nurses, disability support staff or administrative staff, into account, although they may be needed to fully support student mental health.  A whole-of-campus approach is recommended by the national framework, and this cannot be achieved without core multi-annual funding.<\/p> <p>  While international researchers are loath to speak to an increase in mental health problems and suicide levels post-Covid-19, data from within Ireland, such as from the My World Survey 2 study, indicate that within this cohort mental distress was increasing prior to the pandemic, and appears to have continued to increase throughout.<\/p> <p>  Without core multi-annual funding, additional staff can only be hired on short-term contracts.  This not only makes it difficult to hire appropriately-skilled staff, but also makes any kind of planning beyond the short term almost impossible.  In addition, there is currently no information on how the mental health funding from the recent budget will be allocated.  This is resulting in campuses not knowing whether they can keep staff on, or if they need to cut services.  Ring-fenced multi-annual funding is needed to ensure that the mental health of students is seen as an integral aspect of college life.<\/p> <p>  Mental health staff are struggling to deal with the current demand of students presenting themselves in distress.  Recently, on a campus visit, I saw the strain that is being put on services, as there was only standing room left in the waiting room for an emergency counselling drop-in clinic.  It is important to note the fact that counsellors are expected to take on additional work related to the roll-out of various welfare-related policies.  We have recently seen funding being allocated to allow for appointed roles to help with the roll-out of frameworks relating to ending sexual violence and harassment.  We need to see similar funding being allocated to help with the roll-out of welfare-related frameworks.  Without it, it may come down to a counsellor having to choose between rolling out a framework or dealing with students in counselling sessions.<\/p> <p>  Increased multi-annual targeted funding for student counselling services and other student support services must be put in place to allow for the continued roll-out of services to meet demand on an ongoing basis, and in line with recent publications such as the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, Healthy Campus and 3Set reports.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing an increase in students who are registered as having a mental illness in higher education institutes.  That does not include students with sub-clinical needs but who may need mental health supports throughout the year.  We all have mental health and should be able to access supports easily when they are needed.  While the launch of initiatives such as Togetherall is helpful, it should be in addition to core funding.  After all, the aim of Togetherall is to meet a sub-clinical need.<\/p> <p>  A requirement of students applying to college through the disability access route to education, DARE, scheme is the provision of diagnosis by a consultant psychiatrist only.  Ireland does not maintain an adult mental health service waiting list.  However, it is widely accepted that were such a list to exist, it would be long and growing.  This would be something similar to the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, waiting list, which is exceptionally long.  Many young people who are already engaged with psychology services are forced to join the end of psychiatry waiting lists because their current treatment provider is not permitted to verify their diagnosis.<\/p> <p>  Allowing psychologists to certify diagnoses for the purposes of DARE would not only reduce psychiatry waiting lists, but would also allow the higher education sector to take a step closer to being more inclusive, and is something that Union of Students in Ireland, USI, would fully endorse.  USI supports the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI's call for equity of funding for all trainee psychologists, including educational psychologists, and for an increase in places available on trainee courses to increase the number of mental health professionals in Ireland to a level that can meet demand, both on campus and across the country more broadly.  USI calls for a change to DARE and in-college accommodations through disability services to move from only accepting a diagnosis from psychiatry to allowing a diagnosis from a PSI-accredited psychologist.<\/p> <p>  Best practice recommends increasing peer support to increase both mental health supports on campus, and to support student engagement, thus reducing drop-out levels.  Work has also begun, both nationally and internationally, in examining the prospect of embedding well-being into the third level curriculum.<\/p><p>However, the issue to date here is that the majority of this work has been at local level in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>way, not always centring the student voice in the development of such programmes.  The Union of Students in Ireland recognises the continued work to increase student participation and the student voice in student mental health work across the sector is vital and must be done in a non-tokenistic co-creation approach.<br\/><br\/>National co-ordination, collaboration and funding is needed to help these programmes to grow in a way that works for each campus.

IFUT understands quite rightly that much of the focus of this round-table discussion on mental health supports in schools and tertiary education will be framed in the context of student needs.  Therefore, we will focus on issues for employees in this sector that adversely impact on their mental health.<br\/><br\/>In recent months, IFUT welcomed the opportunity to appear before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in relation to the funding requirements of higher education.  The committee published the report, The Future Funding of Higher Education, in July 2022.<br\/><br\/>In relation to today's topic, that report contains many contributions from parties who operate in this sector which are as relevant now as then.  In particular, Chapter 8 &quot;Mental Health and Well-being Supports&rdquo; considered the current demands for mental health support in higher education.  There is a recommendation 9 there that I am sure members of the committee are interested in.<br\/><br\/>IFUT is of the opinion that recommendation 9 adequately and succinctly addresses the core issues in the university sector which negatively impact staff, students and the quality of education and, indeed, the causes of mental health issues, namely precarious employment, the continued application of the employment control framework and the failure of staffing levels to keep pace with the expansion of student and programme numbers thereby resulting in the Irish staff-to-student ratio being one of the largest in Europe.  Precarious employment and a high staff-student ratio create an unmanageable workload culture on the mental health of the people working in the sector.<br\/><br\/>A 2017 study into work-related stress within the higher education institutions, HEI, sector, the Foy report, found that unrealistic demands, lack of resources and constraints on employees lead to stressful workplaces and ultimately lead to a deterioration in mental health.  The report concluded that tackling the causes of work-related stress also makes business sense as doing so leads to reduced absenteeism, higher productivity and lower employee turnover.  A 2015 study which examined precarity and casualisation in the Irish education sector noted that &quot;Many casual workers encapsulated how they felt about their situation with negative descriptors like 'depressed', 'frustrated', 'worried'&rsquo;, 'despondent and hopeless', 'disillusioned', 'demoralised ...&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on 12 October this year about university rankings, TCD Provost Professor Doyle states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe poor staff-student ratio is directly related to the underfunding of the higher education sector in Ireland.  It is vital that Government honours the commitment made earlier this year in 'Funding the Future' [report] and increase annual core funding by &euro;307 million for the higher education sector in Ireland. <\/blockquote> <p>While university rankings are something that may appear to be arbitrary at times, the issue of student-staff ratios are a very serious matter.  IFUT has concluded that there is no systematic effort being made in Ireland to act on the recommendations contained within this report.<br\/><br\/>In the workplace IFUT is responding regularly to new precarious posts and roles being created for members on fixed-term contracts for years, and even decades.  Members' contracts run for nine months of the year but they are expected to mark examinations, engage with students and prepare for the next semester during their three months without pay.  Many of these workers are completely invisible.  They are not on staff lists, email lists or invited to staff meetings.  No one truly knows the extent of the problem of precarious employment in this sector in Ireland.  Figures which are gathered on headcount tend to count full-time equivalents, FTEs.  In the case of part-time or hourly workers, one full-time equivalent could include ten or more real suffering workers.<\/p><p>The committee recommended that the staffing levels of universities \"be reviewed urgently or by end of 2022 at the latest\".  We are fast approaching the end of 2022, but we in IFUT are not aware of any process involving any trade union for examining this issue.<\/p><p> IFUT members report a significant difficulty in making time to provide the pastoral care to students that they deserve and require.  Students may not realise that the lecturer standing before them is on a contract for three hours per week.  When a student requests a one-to-one discussion on the course content or difficulties he or she is experiencing, the student should expect support to be forthcoming.  Little do students know that their lecturers might have to run off after a class to work a second or third job to make ends meet.  This disastrous employment culture is bad for the employee, but also for the students they teach.  The unavailability of lecturers to students will contribute to stress and anxiety for the students.<\/p><p> With daily demands on their time, the ability of some employees to conduct research is curtailed.  This will have longer-term devastating consequences for the quality of the research and education that the institutions provide.  Burnout is real among academics in higher education.<\/p><p> We all know that trade union-organised workplaces are safer workplaces.  In higher education, though, there is a limit to what trade unions can do to impact the work environment without national policy supporting the workers in these institutions.  Conversations about mental health in higher education need to look not just at the supports for workers when they experience mental health problems, but at the causes of workers' suffering in the first place.  IFUT wants to be centrally involved in agreeing decent work, fair workloads and adequate staffing levels across universities and other higher education institutions.  We want to be part of shaping the solution with this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Jones","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, thanks the committee for the opportunity to make this opening statement on the topic of mental health supports in schools and tertiary education.<\/p> <p>  The prevalence of mental health difficulties is a significant issue, not just for the education system, but for society as a whole.  The two education Departments and the wider State have a duty of care not just to students, but also to staff, to support their mental health and well-being.  Education settings, whether post-primary, further education or higher education, can play a vital role in supporting students, staff and families in terms of mental health.  However, education settings cannot do this on their own.  They need support from those same families, the wider community and taxpayers if mental health is to be addressed satisfactorily.  It is also essential that support services, both inside and outside the education system, be resourced to provide specialist assistance as required.<\/p> <p>  Mental health difficulties existed long before the Covid-19 pandemic, but the pandemic has made matters worse.  The TUI is committed to supporting meaningful measures that support students who experience mental health difficulties and their teachers or lecturers who educate them but who can also experience mental health difficulties of their own.<\/p> <p>  Schools and colleges require support from relevant agencies with expertise in mental health if they are to support the affected students adequately and appropriately.  Cuts to pastoral care supports in schools, such as in guidance provision and middle management posts, have also made it difficult for schools to support students in these demanding situations.  The loss of pastoral supports such as assistant principal positions is a situation that the Department of Education has described as \"unsustainable\".  These posts of responsibility are essential in building relationships and identifying issues, especially as a mainstream post-primary teacher usually sees approximately 250 students every week.<\/p> <p>  Mental health support services in tertiary education are significantly understaffed in terms of counsellors, pastoral staff and those with special responsibility for supporting students.  This is even before we take into account the expected increases in student enrolment in further and higher education.  Additional staffing is vital.  Mental health can also become an issue for staff themselves.  Staff may encounter such difficulties in either their personal or professional lives and it is essential that adequate support be available to them too.<\/p> <p>  The TUI would like to make a number of recommendations to the committee.  Mental health in education settings should be taken seriously and appropriate investment of resources, provision of time and training should be made in it for both students and staff.  It is essential that vital support services within schools be restored.<\/p><p>This includes, but is not limited to, guidance support and middle management posts.  Significant investment is needed in out-of-school and out-of-college supports such as child and adult mental health services.  An inclusive support structure should be set up in schools and colleges with access to all the necessary professionals and referrals in a timely manner.  Staffing in NEPS should be expanded to allow for greater one-to-one direct support for students from NEPS psychologists.  We note that some additional staffing has been provided.  A trickle-down model on its own simply is not enough.  The number of counsellors and psychologists in tertiary education support services should, as my colleague from USI said, be increased to the international recommendation of one per 1,000 students.  Training should be provided to teachers and lecturers in how best to refer on students and how to interface with the appropriate services.  The HSE should allow students to access community mental health services in their local community during holiday periods and to access education settings for mental health support during term time and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Significant additional staffing should be provided to the adult education guidance service.  Learners in further education and training, FET, such as Youthreach should have access to a broad range of guidance and counselling supports, as required.  All education staff should have access to mental health support programmes for themselves and for the support of their students.  There should be access to dedicated support teams who work directly with staff and students focusing on prevention over cure.  I thank the committee for listening to this opening statement.  The TUI would be happy to answer any questions members may have.  The TUI would also like to direct the committee to the more extensive written submission we made in August, which provides more detail on the issues I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach, na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la agus na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.

The Irish Second-LeveI Students&rsquo; Union, ISSU, is the national representative body for second-level students in Ireland.  Our core aims are to provide a collective voice for second-level students and to fight for a fair education system that values each individual and allows them to reach their full potential.  Access to adequate and integrated mental health supports in schools and throughout the education system are crucial to allowing students to achieve their full potential.  The ISSU is fully committed to working alongside stakeholders to find solutions to the issues students face.  It is in this spirit that I am before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  As we are all keenly aware, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on students&rsquo; mental health.  While schools are no longer closed and mask-wearing is no longer enforced, the repercussions and aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic are still being felt by many students around Ireland.  This is not the only challenge students face.  There are countless other factors that affect their mental health and students' mental health is undoubtedly suffering in an increasingly online world.  If we are to provide adequate mental health supports for students we must also investigate the causes of mental health difficulties among students.  Students' lives can be stressful enough outside of school, but the fact of the matter is that our education system is actively damaging students&rsquo; mental health.  The reformed junior cycle has developed a more holistic approach to education.  The recently released draft social, personal and health education, SPHE, short course curriculum is evidence of this.  Recently, Department of Education inspectors found that only one in five schools timetable SPHE at senior cycle.  As per our submission, the ISSU recommends the creation and integration of modules within the SPHE curriculum in both junior and senior cycle to educate students about dealing with both their own mental health and how to support their peers.<\/p> <p>  Year after year, the leaving certificate and the CAO cause immense anxiety and stress among students.  In 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child made \"a very strong recommendation\" for reform of the leaving certificate, citing the severe stress it places on students&rsquo; mental health.  The role of guidance counsellors in helping students has not gone unnoticed; as outlined in our submission, we recommend the introduction of a direct referral route for guidance counsellors when a student avails of one-on-one counselling and the provision of funds to schools to introduce an on-site psychologist.<\/p><p>A persistent stigma surrounds mental health in Ireland, particularly among boys and young men.  It is crucial, therefore, that student engagement and peer support be improved to further support the mental health needs of young people.  Initiatives such as Jigsaw's One Good School programme engage students as partners in the creation of a better environment for mental health in their school communities.  Further development of such programmes must happen in collaboration with students to ensure the student voice is represented.<\/p><p> Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge schools and places of education are often the first port of call when addressing any mental health difficulties a students may have.  To this end, it is vital we invest in early invention and at the same time introduce mandatory mental health training for teachers and all school staff during their initial training.  This is important in ensuring we have a proactive whole-school approach to mental health.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, as with many other educational issues, mental health does not affect all students equally.  Students from the Travelling community, students of colour and those from other minority groups, including the LGBTQIA+ community, are at a much higher risk of developing severe mental health difficulties.  Alongside further mental health training, we must introduce mandatory anti-discrimination training to tackle the increased prevalence of mental health difficulties among students from minority groups.<\/p><p> Currently, mental health supports in schools are far from perfect.  Some students will require mental health supports outside their schools.  Increased investment in pre-existing services to expand capacity is therefore vital.  Students going through a mental health crisis should not be placed on a months-long waiting list to access services.  We recommend an independent report and review of CAMHS and better integration of mental health supports between the Departments of Health and Education.<\/p><p> I welcome any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anjelica Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss mental health supports in schools and tertiary education at this roundtable discussion.  It is a complex issue as the supports available to both students and staff are unfortunately quite varied.<br\/><br\/>According to a recent report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, a study by Maynooth University, National College of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin found more than 40% of Irish adults have a mental health disorder.  However, the people most likely to have a mental health disorder were younger and likely to have suffered a traumatic life event.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the members we represent, SNAs are specifically affected.  When a traumatic event occurs in a school community the first response is the arrival of NEPS at the school.  When NEPS leaves, however, it is the SNAs who assist the students in their times of need.  Often, the traumatic event is compounded for these students by their additional needs.<br\/><br\/>We must have a holistic approach to tragic events, one that encompasses the entire community, including management, teachers, SNAs, secretaries, caretakers, parents and siblings.  They all need to have access to a community-based mental health service as a tragedy is a tragedy.  There must be a more structured approach.  We have heard many personal accounts many months after a tragedy, up to eight months later.  For example, when a student passes away, a student under the care of an SNA may pull out a book or toy that happened to be the favourite of their deceased classmate and that child is brought back to the grief and loss of their friend.  While NEPS provides a valuable service, it unfortunately only deals with students in the moment and at a particular point in time.<br\/><br\/>It is vital that SNAs are given access to appropriate training and support that allow them to support the mental health needs of the students they work with.  SNAs are often overlooked in this regard, which is unfortunate given the close bond and rapport that exists between SNAs and the students they work with.  There is a lack of recognition for SNAs as a professional grade, for example, in comparison with social workers.  Social workers have a defined career hierarchy and support structure, with senior and principal social workers, which encourages reflective practice and child-centred interventions based on the individual child's needs.  Sadly this type of professional infrastructure does not exist for SNAs, but it should.  Through the introduction of school-based mental health supports at primary level, there is an opportunity to strengthen and protect the mental well-being of children while also supporting their parents, teachers and SNAs.  This could also lead to a reduction in the number of children who require specialist mental health treatment.<br\/><br\/>Staff members can have mixed experiences when dealing with their employers on the subject of mental health and well-being.<\/p><p>According to Mind, a UK-based mental health charity, more than one in five or 21% agreed they have called in sick to avoid work when asked how workplace stress had affected them; 14% agreed they had resigned and 42% had considered resigning when asked how workplace stress had affected them; 30% of staff disagreed with the statement, \"I would feel able to talk openly with my line manager if I was feeling stressed\"; and 56% of employers said they would like to do more to improve staff well-being but do not feel they have the right training or guidance.<\/p><p> As regards the Department of Education, while it has extensive policies on the well-being and health of children and young people, which are to be commended, for those policies to be realised it must support the workers who in turn will support the students and young people they work with on a daily basis.  It has fallen to the trade union movement to provide employee assistance programmes to its members, whereas this should be provided as a matter of course by the Department for all of its staff.  Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, appropriate training and support must be afforded to special needs assistants who are working at the coalface in schools along with their teaching colleagues.  However, a disparity exists in this regard as teachers can avail of extra personal days, EPV days, or as they are more colloquially known, \"course days\", whereas special needs assistants, SNAs, cannot.  As well as that Mental Health Ireland only offer their &ldquo;Mind-out&rdquo; course to teachers and youth workers.  The Mind-out programme that was developed by the Health Promotion Research Centre at NUI Galway and the HSE&rsquo;s health promotion and improvement department has been proven to strengthen young people's social and emotional coping skills and improve their overall mental health and well-being.  It is a question that F&oacute;rsa raises here today as to why SNAs have not been included in the roll-out of this programme?   <\/p><p> Barnardos children&rsquo;s charity who work with some of Ireland&rsquo;s most vulnerable families have a saying that every childhood lasts a lifetime.  SNAs want to support the totality of a child&rsquo;s and young person&rsquo;s development, but they must be given access to training and support to allow them to acquire and develop the skills to protect, nurture and support the mental health and the well-being of the students that they work with.  The Department of Education needs to recognise the valuable contribution that SNAs can make in preventing poor mental health and ensuring that all of our children and young people thrive in the school community.  I thank the committee for their time today and F&oacute;rsa are happy to answer any questions that the committee may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Honer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Honer.

I am conscious colleagues that I am the seventh speaker in a row and, therefore, I will do what I will call a little mop-up operation and the committee has the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, submission which they can consult for a refinement of the policies.   I wish to make three remarks.  Number one, we welcome the opportunity.  I love that concept developed by Maureen Gaffney - \"Flourishing\".  Well-being is something that is more than just an individual matter.  Failure to flourish at school or college is never an individual problem it is a societal problem and as Maureen has said schools are the optimal sites for responding to mental health difficulties for young people.<\/p> <p>  We have not mentioned the extent of the problem and the prevalence of the problem around the table and I think it is important.  Two major pieces of research are referred to.  <\/p> <p> In 2013, research by the Royal College of Surgeons demonstrated that by the age of 13, one in three children had experienced a mental health difficulty.  By the age of 24, that had increased to one in two.  It is clear that youth and adolescence are times when significant life and health challenges are addressed and that is the optimal time to intervene.  As Mr. Honer said, recent research by NUI Maynooth found that young people aged 18 to 24 are eight times more likely to have mental health difficulties than the older population.  It is a bit like the housing crisis talk about the \"squeezed youth\" they are really facing a barrage of life challenges.  Of course, the impact of Covid-19, anxiety, stress, depression are beginning to surface and manifest.  <\/p> <p>  We have not mentioned around the table, and I think it is kind of important, the extent of the problem and the prevalence of the problem.  There are two major pieces of research that are referred to.  First is the 2013 Royal College of Surgeons research which found that by the age of 13 one in three children had experienced a mental health difficulty.   By the age of 24 that had increased to one in two.   It is very clear that youth and adolescence are times when significant life challenges and health challenges are addressed and that is the optimal time to intervene.  As Mr. Honer said, recent research by NUI Maynooth hsa found that young people aged 18 to 24 are eight times more likely to have mental health difficulty than older populations.  It is a bit like the housing crisis we talk about the 'squeezed youth'.  They are really facing a barrage of life challenges and of course the impact of Covid-19 anxiety, stress, depression are beginning to surface and manifest.<\/p> <p>  We are here today because committee members are legislators and they inform and make policy.  I always think it is good to come with a shopping list because the committee needs to know how it can help given it is genuinely concerned about these social problems.  From ASTI's perspective, there are a number of core areas that the committee needs to intervene in quickly.  First, the committee needs to address the situation as regards guidance counselling in schools.  Teachers are contracted to teach 22 hours, the allocation ratio for guidance counsellors in a school of 500 pupils is 18 hours so they are not even getting a full-time guidance counsellor.<\/p><p>The allocation ratio has to be changed in light of that as it has been around for the past 30 years. Second, according to research I picked up this morning from the Institute of Guidance Counselling that they conducted this year, in 10% of the schools they surveyed the guidance counsellor was not practising as he or she was too burned out.  Some 22% schools had unqualified internal staff filling the role and 26% of schools had external advisers coming in to fill the role.  We have a crisis in the guidance counselling service that has to be addressed.<\/p><p> The other crisis is in area of the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  CAMHS is a brilliant service if one gets into it.  It is a bit like the health service.  The waiting list is absolutely critical.  We have waiting lists for up to 18 months.  That is completely not the way to sort out the problem of a child with a mental health issue.  There is also the variability across the regions and there was a dreadful incidence of other issues in the service last summer.  <\/p><p> I like to think politics works and I was impressed by the way this committee heard from Dr. Paul Downes from the Dublin City University, DCU, Disadvantage Centre last year.  He made a compelling case about the need to supplement the guidance counselling service in schools with emotional counselling and therapeutic supports to address the mental health issues manifesting among young people.  I urge all Oireachtas Members to look at Dr. Downes's 2017 research on a sample of young men who are homeless in Dublin and the reasons for their homelessness and as someone who works for teachers and is very proud of our education system, how they fell through the gaps in the system at second level.  It is truly sad but can be remediated and I urge committee members to look at that and at the recommendations he has in it.<\/p><p>  Mr. Duffy had made the point in respect of school leadership that we need more posts.  Teacher training is essential and we have a further crisis in teacher training in that teachers are now not able to get a day out of school to go to necessary training because of the supply issue.  When these crises are not addressed, they become much more complex to solve.<\/p><p> Mr. Jones addressed a topic that is under-addressed when we talk about well-being and mental health, which is the whole area of teacher well-being.   The 2015 guidelines for well-being in the junior cycle make the point that student well-being starts with staff.  They are on the front line of the work and it is hard for them to be genuinely motivated to promote emotional and social well-being if they feel uncared for or burnt out themselves.  Perhaps this is an area the committee may wish to look at into the future.  We need to address the issue of well-being among our teaching workforce, including at third level.  It is at a really serious level.   Naturally I would have lots of other things to say but I will conclude on that.  We did not get around to curriculum, which is a vital area for intervention for youth mental health but we are not just here to talk; we are here to listen and to respond to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Leydon.

The mental health pressures faced by young people cannot be dealt with in schools alone.  There is no question of that.  The pressures they face come from all aspects of society and we could have a big discussion about whether it is the loosening of the binds of community, the pressure of exams and whatever perceived success is, all kinds of other things and social media.   This is beyond the remit of the committee but the fact is our CAMHS system is so profoundly under-resourced and struggling so badly.   To give an example that I think the speakers will be familiar with it but for anyone listening in who is not, I have come across instances where there are young people who are self-harming but are believed to have inadequate suicidality to be admitted to CAMHS.  That is a person with a severe crisis who is very much at risk and cannot access CAMHS.  That is the situation we have and it is important to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  There are challenges and pressures but we do have opportunities in schools.

My experience as a primary school teacher and as a principal is that if we had something co-located in schools children who are at huge risk are more likely to engage.  Most children come to school every day.  Their parents bring them to school.  It is valuable for an at-risk child and an at-risk parent to have somewhere they can come to do both and where the child does not have to be moved out of the building.  There are models of good practice from the UK, Iceland and other countries where we have seen this working well.  We would like to re-examine the concept of community.  For many pupils community is the school.  The school is at the centre of the community in many rural areas.  Our official definition of community is too narrow in this context.  The school should be central to that definition of community.<\/p> <p>  There are certainly many programmes running in schools that are hugely beneficial.  We are at an exciting stage of the development of a new curriculum at primary level and there will be opportunities under the wellbeing specification and a lot of good work will be done, but a therapeutic service cannot be replaced for a child who needs it.  Teachers are not psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors or therapists and while they can create, as I was told 40 years ago, an atmosphere of psychological safety in their classroom, they cannot recreate a therapeutic setting.  They need support to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>The provision of guidance counselling in schools varies, as my colleagues pointed out previously.

I am sorry; it is never a healthy political attitude to have.  We will call on the Minister to extend it.  I referenced the prevalence of mental health difficulties.  Adolescence is the prime time for these difficulties to manifest.  If we are not in a space where adolescents can get early intervention and support, that is a failure to help because that is when they need it.  They also need it later on, but getting in there now we have remediation, as distinct from dealing with a much more serious problem.  We will be going formally to the Minister for Education and talking about the model and what the plans are for second level.<\/p> <p>  Going back to Dr. Downes's work, the key points are not that radical.  They are about the transition from primary to second level, the gaps that exist and the staff in schools being unable to deal with challenging behaviour.  Therefore, there is a vicious cycle of suspensions and expulsion.  They are also about students who have no self-belief or self-esteem and therefore are poor learners and failing.  Many of these issues can be addressed with appropriate resources in schools.  We come before the committee all the time and we say that we want more resources, but this is the nub of the problem.  There is an under-investment in schools.  Teachers are not mental health workers.  We are not putting other professionals in place in the school setting to address the holistic needs of young people.

I will make some comments before Ms Foley expands on some of the issues she raised.  Much of what she said has resonated with many of us here.  The Irish education system is almost uniquely set up to have mental health challenges within it.  We separate children on the basis of religion and income and we separate them more than any other European country seems to.  From my own experience, I know that children are coming to the school gate hungry and possibly having not slept the previous night or witnessed things that they probably should not as children and then facing the scenario of an oversized class with a teacher trying to balance all the needs of those children.  We have one of the largest class sizes in Europe.  It is coming down however and that should be acknowledged.  It is a reality in the classroom.  The SNA, as Mr. Honer rightly said, is under-appreciated in the system and is struggling for respect.  There is an absolutely traumatic change at the most vital time, as Ms Leydon rightly said, in their formative years when going from the primary school setting to secondary school, with a complete change in the ethos and the exam-driven atmosphere.  You are trying to tackle issues like homophobia or transphobia in a school.  You have to worry about what the patron body has to say about those matters because we have a disproportionate number of schools under religious patronage.<\/p> <p>  Ms Foley made a point about the new junior certificate being a welcome development.  The resistance to that change was something the Department had to grapple with.  When we speak about leaving certificate change, I hear resistance to that and a determination to go back to where we were.  Within all of that we must pay tribute to teachers, SNAs and those working in schools who do their absolute best to mind the mental health of the students in front of them.  There are gaps between what the HSE provides and what the Department of Education provides.  Often, children fall between those gaps.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on one thing with Ms Foley, namely, exams at second level because many issues have been raised.  There is a focus on exams.  The teacher has 40 minutes to deliver the programme and there can be pressure from parents about what the teacher is doing and how the targets are being met.  Everything seems to come down to the junior certificate results and then, of course, the leaving results and the pressures associated with that.<\/p><p>Can Ms Foley expand on that and maybe feed into what we all hope, certainly from my point of view, will be a changed leaving certificate and a changed system at second level that allows the space for a young person to be themselves and not to fit into this very rigid old exam that suits some people?  Of course, one knows that people that it suits tend to make the rules when they move on from second level but those who it does not suit do not tend to make the rules.  Can Ms Foley expand on that and use the opportunity the committee presents to tell us from her organisation's perspective how she feels the exam system impacts on mental health and how it could be changed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#O00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for his question.  It is really important that I frame my response in light of the current situation of the leaving certificate.  I sat my leaving certificate this summer and, as I am sure the committee is aware, all of us here have sat our exams.  At the moment, due to the pandemic and the changes, it is more stressful than ever.  Students, whether they are high or low achievers, are always stressed.  Right now there are students around the country who scored maximum number of points and still did not get the places they wanted.  They still did not get their first choice.  Can one imagine the stress those students face?  Can one imagine the stress a student faces when it comes to the Central Applications Office, CAO, and waiting for those results as well as for junior cycle students who until last week did not know when they would get their results?  Exams will always be stressful but there is so much we can do to make them less stressful.  It is really important that we do not just consider the students.  It is also really important that when we are making these changes, we speak to the teachers too.  In Ireland we have one of the best education systems in the world and it is not just because of what we are teaching students but because of the relationships that teachers and students have.  Students and teachers and the pastoral care system mean that students can build a real connection with their teachers and<i>vice versa<\/i>.  That is really important with mental health supports, that is, that students can trust their teachers and<i>vice versa<\/i>.  Reform is important but it is really important that when we talk about reform, we talk to everybody to encourage positive change so we do not have to reform it again so drastically in 20 years' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anjelica Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Does Ms Foley find at second level that the exam pressure is there from day one until the day one leaves and that it is unreasonable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#P00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>That is fair to say for students when one thinks about the leaving certificate system.

I want to focus on two things.  The first is the resources.  It is important that every time witnesses come before us that they raise the importance of resources so that it gets into our reports.  Nobody wants to hear that schools are not funded enough and that teachers do not get the kind of training they need.<\/p> <p>  The second thing is training.  There was a real call for further training for teachers from today's witnesses and the witnesses who came before the committee last week.  That has come through loud and clear from all of the opening statements today.  I have come from a National Women's Council briefing on education around relationship sexuality education, RSE, and healthcare.  The call there was for further training and professionalisation for social, personal and health education, SPHE, teachers, for instance, in order to be able to deliver what is now quite complex.  Society has become really complex and young people are dealing with that.  As F&oacute;rsa pointed out in its opening statement, 40% of adults have mental health challenges and that starts out somewhere.  That starts when people are really young.<\/p> <p>  Do witnesses think it is about focused teacher training for some subjects like SPHE or do they think it needs to be across the board?<\/p><p>As I said last week, teachers are sometimes a little like GPs.  Everyone comes to teachers although they might not be the people qualified to deal with a particular issue.  They are the conduit to send people in the right direction.  Should mental health training be provided to all teachers?<\/p><p> Second, I will focus on the lack of services for teachers to direct pupils to.  It is all very well to understand that someone is experiencing a mental health crisis but everyone in this room will recognise if there is no one for teachers to refer pupils to, they will be left carrying the can because of the relationships they build with young people.  I welcome any thoughts the witnesses might have on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#P00900","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>What I will say is similar to some extent to my answer to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question earlier.<\/p> <p>  The three main issues the Senator hit on are vitally important in the area.  One is being able to access CAMHS and adult mental health services as we are also talking about tertiary education.  Any comments I make of CAMHS, adult mental health, NEPS or any other service, is not the fault of the staff.  They are simply dealing with waiting lists that are utterly unmanageable, but timely referrals are needed.<\/p> <p>  Pastoral staff in both colleges and schools are vitally important as the Senator rightly referenced.  We have many reports of guidance counsellors in schools doing a fantastic job often in difficult circumstances.  My colleague from the ASTI mentioned that some schools do not have a whole-time-equivalent guidance counsellor.  Many cases are referred to us of guidance counsellors holding on to students who have levels of need that the guidance counsellor knows she or he cannot manage.  There is nowhere to refer the student to so it is the case that holding on is better than doing nothing.  This is not a criticism of the staff in NEPS who do a fantastic job but they are swamped.  NEPS staff members need to be on the ground with individual students.  A trickle down model serves a purpose but it does not solve the problem.<\/p> <p>  Third, as the Senator stated very well, training needs to be available to all teachers.  There is a teacher supply crisis and releasing people for training will be difficult but it must be available to all teachers.  Continuous professional development, CPD, is vital, but no matter how much CPD we do in this area, teachers will still not be psychiatrists or psychologists.  In the past few days we encountered an issue about assessment of needs.  No matter how much training teachers do, they will not be occupational therapists.  Therefore we still need to be able to refer students to experts and as many services as possible need to be close to schools so students can be referred, but I must re-emphasise that services must be available in a timely manner.  Telling students that the local service will help them in 18 months time is not ideal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>At primary level we have a generalist rather than specialist model.  I made the point the other day to someone that initial teacher education takes between four and six years depending on which model a student follows.  Some people are in a classroom for 40 years after qualifying.  We must provide our teachers with CPD.  It should be available at all stages of their careers, kept up to date, based on best practice and on evidence-based models.  I reiterate what Dr. Duffy said about needing specialist help.  Schools and teachers cannot solve all of the ills of society.  We must have services.

Training needs to be provided for SNAs as well as for our teaching colleagues.  It should be provided for all colleagues in the school setting.  As I said in my presentation, this is not a criticism of Mental Health Ireland, but it is just a fact.  If one goes on to Mental Health Ireland&rsquo;s website to access the MindOut programme, there is a tab for teachers and a tab for youth workers, but there is no tab for SNAs.  SNAs should be able to avail of the training if they want it.  If they are armed with that skill set, they will be better equipped to deal with students in their times of crisis.  I would agree with the Senator completely in terms of training.

Anyway, moving on.<\/p> <p>  It is always important for people who have experience, even as a politician or whatever, to draw on that experience and say that they know what they are speaking about.  When I was just 11, I was in a very bad accident.  I lost my mother a few days before that accident.  There were no supports around counselling or trauma in school, which led on to some anxiety and depression that still exists today because it was not dealt with when I was a young person.  Those supports are well needed for young people today.  In one sense, we are moving as a society because of the teachers, the SNAs and the professionals that we have now within our education system, who see that we should not be taking part in shaming people with mental health and trauma issues.<\/p> <p>  I know that in its investment for the budget, one of the INTO's recommendations was to invest in mental health.  We are doing much talking around mental as a society, but we are doing very little action around young people and mental health.  Again, we talk about some of the organisations.  Some areas such as Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Inchicore and Cherry Orchard do not have the same level of mental health services as other more upper-class areas, if you want.  I am aware that mental health does not have a class.  However, there are different levels of pressure around people from, say, communities such as mine, namely, the Traveller community from Ballyfermot.<\/p> <p>  One of my questions is directed at F&oacute;rsa and the INTO.  Would it be fair to say that DEIS or disadvantaged schools would need more mental health services than non-disadvantaged schools?  The SNAs are lifesavers to a certain extent in our schools.  Sharing the Vision states that the training is there for teachers.  For example, if there is a young child in a wheelchair in a school, he or she has an SNA.  The SNA is the carer and educator.  They take on so many roles, as well as the teacher.  It is important that we include our SNAs in the training.  There are so many different levels of training that are expected for our teachers, for example, training in Traveller culture, other cultures and mental health.  SNAs are carrying out the job on very low wages as well.  They did not go to school to be professional psychologists; they went to be educators.  There is a difference.  That was the one question about disadvantaged schools.<\/p> <p>  I have a question around the barriers of being diagnosed with a mental disorder or any kind of disorder that young people would have in primary or secondary school.<\/p><p>What kind of positive impact would a diagnosis at a younger age have on a young person's life?  I am sick to the teeth of pilot programmes that do not work or even if they do work, do not get implemented.  I know the witnesses have the answers but how do we implement those answers?  It is not about reinventing the wheel.  We are not geniuses saying this is what we need to do.  The answers are already there.  Obviously, money is a big part of it.

We hear them time and time again.  We cannot hear them often enough but very little happens in terms of implementation.  It is frustrating from our point of view so it must be frustrating from the witnesses' point of view when they see so little movement yet they present all the solutions here today.  We do not need enormous reports or pilot projects.  Like everybody, I am tired of pilot projects.  It is not just a case of me being tired of them, it is the money we waste when we do not use what we learn from the pilot projects.  It is very frustrating when there is no in-built evaluation and streamlining of those projects.  I have been involved in some of them around mental health, bullying and other topics and I think we need to think long and hard.  I know it is an attractive proposition if somebody gets some money to do a pilot project but I wonder whether we are all colluding in keeping things where they are.  Those were some of the ethical questions - even for myself - around working in community development.  To what degree were we colluding in that system?<\/p> <p>  My first question is directed to Ms Behan.  Obviously, the solution is core funding.  Core funding in third-level education has to be fixed.  It also relates to what Mr. Jones was saying about staffing as well but without the core multi-annual funding, we are just not going to fix this problem.  There is no skirting around it.<\/p><p>While it might be politically expedient to announce one project or one pilot project after another and to get the headlines for a couple of days and then go off on our merry way, if we do not fix what is under the bonnet then we are not going to fix this at all.  When Ms Hughes said that there was \"standing room only\" on the waiting list, how many of those people standing there could not wait or did not wait to get the supports and services they needed?  We are dealing with people's lives here, as all of the witnesses know.<\/p><p>Ms Hughes said the total funding for on-campus mental health supports was &euro;5 million in 2020-21 and again in 2021-22; for the past three years, the mental health budget has stayed the same.  However, &euro;3 million is announced each year as additional funding.  There are figures being played around with, which is nonsense.  That needs to be called out.  We are a cross-party committee.  Mental health for young people is more serious than any political party on its own.  We need to call it out, whether within our own parties or whatever to stop this from happening.  While the ability to announce the funding each year as if it is new money is politically beneficial, how disruptive is it to providing a proper service on-campus when they cannot be planned properly and organisations do not have the resources on a year-on-year basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#S00500","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  It is exceedingly disruptive.  The money that was provided last year for Covid-19-related additional supports went unspent in a number of colleges for one of two reasons.  First, because it was one-time funding, only a year's contract could be offered.  There is a dearth of people who can apply for these jobs and that is not an attractive job posting.  It is hard to fill a position like that.  On top of that, many campuses do not have space to <i>ad hoc <\/i>hire two or three more counsellors for a year and then have them go off again.  That was a situation we were faced with last year.  Regarding the campus I referred to where there was standing room only on the waiting list, the head of counselling there told me they have two sessional staff they do not know if they can keep on beyond the end of November.  If that happens, they have five staff, I think, so that is almost half of their staff gone.  That has an obvious knock-on impact not just on the number of students that can be seen but also on the roll-out of things like the national suicide prevention framework.  It does not have a specific staff member allocated for the roll-out, so it falls onto staff like counselling staff, who have to juggle their session loads and the roll-out of multiple frameworks at this stage.

I thank the witnesses for their submissions and presentations.<\/p><p>I endorse various things I heard, including what Mr. Honer said about the important work and role of SNAs and the need to put more structure and recognition into their situation.  I will especially mention what Ms Foley had to say about the stress caused by the leaving certificate examinations and I will speak about that in a moment.  I also endorse what Ms Leydon said about pastoral supports and the role of guidance counsellors and what Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;&iacute;leachair said, which was also a point made in the INTO submission, about family and marriage breakdown.  That is an issue that needs to be talked about.  There is a crisis in that area and in our society, which lies behind much of what we are talking about today.  We do not speak about it often.<\/p><p> I will begin, however, with the issue that worries me most, namely, the Maynooth University study that states that 40% of Irish adults have a mental health disorder.  If we really believe that, I wonder if any amount of resources can deal with the problems we face because that would be indicative of a society in a state of breakdown.  We advert to these statistics, as we should, because they are published by researchers.  We need to interrogate that figure and what it means for our society.  I read up a little on it and it states that insomnia is one of the main issues.  How long can a society continue to function if 40% of people have mental health challenges?<\/p><p> I mentioned to the group who attended the committee meeting last week that while I support and endorse the various calls for resources, I ask people to focus on whether changes to the system can help.  I would be grateful to hear the witnesses' views on whether, given the shortage of experienced staff in the system, including in psychology, speech and language therapy and medicine, the shortage of people available to work in Ireland will bedevil the entire effort no matter what resources are in place.  Would the witnesses support a policy that reserved 50% or 60% of college places in the areas of psychology, pharmacy, speech and language therapy, medicine, etc., for people who are ready to work in Ireland for a defined period?  That is the kind of serious measure that is needed.  Is that something that is under discussion?  Is it on people's radar?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#T00500","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I can speak from the perspective of a psychology graduate.  When we consider clinical psychology in particular - because that is the one being funded - there is a bottleneck.  Many undergraduate psychologists would love to go on to study for specialist qualifications but the places are not available due largely to funding issues.  Although clinical psychology training is funded, only a small number of spaces - I believe there are approximately 36 in the country - is available.  It was even harder for undergraduates to access those courses that were not funded until the recent budget as they had to self-fund.  I know the Psychological Society of Ireland feels the same way.  Many undergraduate psychology students have to move on to different career paths because they cannot access specialist training.

Graduates tend to be young people.  They cannot get homes.  We have a crisis of supply and affordability and therefore emigration is exerting a pull.  Over the generational cycle we see it operating in a defined sense.  There has been discussion in the media recently about the number of health graduates emigrating.  It is a complex issue.  We need to know more about why they are emigrating.  Why are conditions in our health service seen as so unattractive that they lead people to decide to emigrate?<\/p> <p>  We have not given sufficient support to the national plan for equity of access to higher education which is now in its second iteration.<\/p><p>We tend to base our projections for entering into higher education on school leavers but as a society, particularly for the human sciences like the therapies, health, social services etc., we need to see how we can encourage more workers who have experiential knowledge of problems in real-life settings to go into further learning, particularly at higher education level.  It is very expensive, particularly if you are not earning and have a family to raise.  While I would perceive there being a problem out there, we need to see what are the pull factors, including those of other economies and jobs, and what we can do as a society to make sure we get more people into these jobs.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, made a successful pitch recently - he said we should stop looking at school leavers going into third-level education as a solution to all of the skills problems in this country.  We need to start thinking about other post-school destinations in order that people have a spectrum of skills and life experiences and can then, if they wish and have sufficient financial security to do so, move on to third level.

Resilience is very important.  When we consider the factors that contribute to mental health difficulties for students, it is interesting to look at students with enduring mental health.  By that I mean students who have not encountered a mental health difficulty.  There are many factors at play.  When we look at schools, we should consider them not only in an educational context but also in the context of other experiences of schools, which can lead to students being more resilient in their mental health.  Factors such as sport, being on the student council and the friends a pupil makes at school are all part of the support circle that will build resilience.

I welcome that we have been able to bring so many of the representative groups and unions to speak to the committee about mental health.<\/p> <p>  A number of the members of this committee also sit on the education committee and like me, on the mental health committee, which is a brand-new sub-committee of the health committee.  We see many concerns being raised, especially during the two years of lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I have a few questions which I will pose and hopefully allow some time for a short response.<\/p> <p>  I agree with a point mentioned by the witnesses in their submissions that the transition phase is crucial, especially going into first class, first year and from secondary school to third level.  I agree that transition period is a huge issue and note that Ms Leydon of the ASTI also mentioned it.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions about the summer programme.  It is about the investment we are now seeing coming from the budget into education.  Some &euro;9.6 billion is going to education with almost &euro;2.6 billion going to special education.  We will have almost 40,000 new staff, that is almost 20,000 SNAs and almost 20,000 special education teachers coming into the system.  Mr. Honer is representing SNAs at the committee.  I want to see the courses that UCD is rolling out being rolled out around the country.  We will tackle getting 20,000 people their well-deserved qualifications.  That has to happen.  The Minister is aligned with how we see that being rolled out.  As I represent the Roscommon-Galway area, I want to see much of it in the west.<\/p><p>I refer to the number of people who are coming into the school system and how that has been managed as a teaching staff.  There is a cohort of teaching staff working with the special education teachers, including the mainstream teacher in the classroom and the SNA support.  I would like to see it being more streamlined and I see that in schools I deal with in my area on that level.  Does Mr. Honer have any more comments on that?<\/p><p> I might ask our guests from the ASTI and the INTO some questions about the summer programme.  We have just announced funding on that and we are seeing one quarter of schools taking part.  I have contacted schools in my area and I have good feedback from a number of principals about the impact of those two weeks, particularly for those schools.  Are there any other challenges?  We have a budget and we have this extra capacity coming to schools.  They have also opened up the possibility that student teachers and different cohorts could be involved.  Will we see anything with schools coming on board this year?  It would be great to see a real increase in that.  Are there any other challenges in that which we need to be conscious of?  That bringing students in over the summer period helps with the transition piece.<\/p><p> The funding models, pilot programmes and so on are crucial because most initiatives we see come from pilots.  The initiatives we have seen at third level came from pilot programmes.  We are seeing technological universities being rolled out, which has been amazing in delivering excellence to the regions.  We have spoken about mental health supports here but we have to look at how we deliver health in a different way.  Much of this is now coming through telehealth and is being accessed in a virtual way for early intervention.  We need to look at changing how we deliver healthcare at an early stage sometimes.  I would be interested to hear comments on that as well, because the 50808 text number is a 24-7 one that is crucial for anyone going through anxiety or any type of stress.<\/p><p> The changes we see in the roll-out of the leaving certificate programme are something else we have been fighting for.  It should not all be pinned on one exam and that does not deliver for all students and for all capacities and capabilities.  We have the action plan on bullying and this committee did a report on that, which was one of our first reports.  The Minister for Education has taken on board a number of elements of that.  There has also been &euro;5 million rolled out for that for primary schools.  There has been an increase in NEPS with about 54 more psychologists coming on board in that.<\/p><p> My questions begin with the summer programme, particularly the transition and how we increase the number of schools taking on that programme this year when we have the funding available for it.  I also invite comments on the engagement with CAMHS and community teams that has been mentioned.  How do we set up a structure where the secondary school system can engage with our new disability teams in the community space, particularly in the community healthcare organisations, CHOs?  On the counselling supports and the action plan on bullying, each school has an ethos and parents sometimes have to look at what the ethos of each school is.  In the inspector's annual report, reference is being made to how bullying is being managed in each school.  With this new recommendation from the action plan, we will hopefully see this.  What are the witnesses&rsquo; comments on that?  How will schools engage in that action plan on bullying and how will they manage it?  These are the matters I see as being of interest.  I might start with the transition and I invite Ms Leydon to speak on that from ASTI's point of view.  Mr. Honer might come in on the SNAs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#W00900","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":523,"content":"<p>We might discuss that briefly because I am conscious that we have to suspend to bring in the next group and that we have to be out of here by 2 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I have to defer to my INTO colleague because second level is not the dominant space where the July provision is provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Can I ask Ms Leydon if secondary schools cannot provide this or why secondary schools will not provide this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00400","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":526,"content":"<p>It is not that they will not provide it but the facts of the matter are that many of the students whose parents want them to attend the July provision will be students with significant disabilities-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I do not think it is just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00600","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":528,"content":"<p>-----and quite often many of those students would not be in the second level system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#X00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I disagree to some extent.

The successful delivery of the examinations annually depends on a broad coalition which includes school managers and leaders; teachers, including retired teachers, who are fulfilling critical roles; and the education stakeholders.  The SEC recently announced Wednesday, 23 November as junior cycle results day.  We acknowledge that candidates and their families may be disappointed that the date is later than might have been expected.<\/p> <p>  We hope to provide the committee with details of what is behind the delay in issuing results and of the efforts made, in collaboration with stakeholders, to address the most significant issue, which is a shortage of teachers to mark the examinations.  This meant that marking in all subjects was not completed during the normal summer marking window.  The results of the leaving certificate issued on 2 September, with the appeals issued five weeks later on 4 October.  The deferred leaving certificate ran until 16 July for candidates who missed their examinations due to bereavement, serious illness or Covid-19.  Additional time was also needed to give effect to the commitment that the results on aggregate would be no lower than in 2021, which was achieved through a post-marking adjustment.<\/p> <p>  The later leaving certificate results issue date has had an impact on the junior cycle timeline.  Changes to the leaving certificate appeals timeline in 2019 saw an October date for the junior cycle results for the first time, by agreement of all of the stakeholders.  This year, if the marking had been completed, the junior cycle results would have been due to issue to candidates at the end of October.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of examiner supply, pre-pandemic, the SEC had been experiencing significant difficulties in attracting, recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of teachers to undertake this vital work.  Up to and including 2019, it was necessary to put in place a range of remedial measures to complete the marking within expected timeframes.  The challenges we are faced with are evident from the statistics; the SEC traditionally recruited 4,000 examiners to mark the written examinations.  This year, fewer than 3,000 examiners marked the work of 130,000 candidates.  Allied to demographic increases, candidate numbers are 12% more than they were ten years ago.  The number of examiners involved in marking the examinations is almost 19% lower than it was ten years ago.  Junior cycle candidate numbers have increased by 5% since 2019, while the number of examiners has decreased by 30% this year.  With the support of stakeholders, the SEC has made repeated and extensive efforts to recruit examiners in sufficient numbers for the 2022 examinations.  These efforts included online advertising and marketing to teachers and schools including in teacher union publications; appeals to principals to take on a leadership role in encouraging and supporting this work; appeals to subject associations and support services such as the professional development service for teachers, PDST, and junior cycle for teachers, JCT and thousands of direct telephone calls and emails to teachers who had examined previously.  Significant increases to payment rates were approved in recognition of the co-operation, flexibility and support needed.  Leaving certificate rates increased by between 17% and 50% per script, while junior cycle rates increased by between 48% and 57% per script marked.  A recruitment campaign called \"Earn, learn and understand\" highlighted the many professional and financial benefits of this work.<\/p> <p>  Despite these efforts, the numbers fell short and a range of interventions was needed to complete the marking of most subjects during the summer, which included marking well beyond the normal marking window and examiners agreeing to take on additional scripts.  These measures, while necessary, put pressure on the examining teams and contribute to a poor examiner experience and impact retention.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to complete the marking in all subjects.  Further contingency arrangements have been made to ensure that the marking will be completed in the coming weeks.  Unlike in the summer marking period, most of the teachers now marking are in schools during the day and only available at evenings and weekends.<\/p> <p>  The commission has an absolute responsibility to examination candidates to ensure that their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity.  Over the past three years, due to the circumstances created by the pandemic, delivery of the State examinations has been extremely challenging with many changes required to ensure delivery of the service.  The ending of Covid-19 restrictions and the return to examinations as normal have exacerbated an issue which existed before the pandemic, one which challenges the management and completion of the marking and the ability of the SEC to issue the results.  The SEC is extremely grateful for the co-operation it receives from thousands of teachers each year to undertake critical work in the State examinations, noting that this is voluntary, subsidiary employment which teachers undertake during their school holidays.<\/p><p>Recruitment and retention of teachers as examiners is not only a whole of organisation issue for the SEC, it is a major and urgent whole of system issue at second level.  Addressing the issue requires regular engagement with key stakeholders and the active support and involvement of all the players, especially school management and teachers' unions, as well as the continued support of the Department of Education which has already provided improved examiner rates.  The SEC will be reviewing with stakeholders how best to ensure the availability of teachers in the required numbers to engage in this critical work in the future.   Our objective is to substantially increase the number of teachers involved so that the experience is a positive one which greatly enhances teacher professional competence as well as earning power.<\/p><p> On a positive note, the rate increases which were introduced on a once-off basis in 2022 have now been assured for 2023 with the assignment of an additional &euro;11 million on budget day to maintain these increased examiners' pay rates.<\/p><p> My colleagues and I are happy to respond to any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#Z00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Feeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I want to confirm that we did not receive the opening statement last night.

Later examinations were held for adult learners and early school leavers.  They were held in November with the results issuing in February.  Arrangements were made through SOLAS in order that those students could progress in the absence of their results.  We have been in contact with SOLAS to see if a similar arrangement can be put in place for this year.  That is a work in progress at the moment.  In regard to further engagement with both teacher unions, yes the examinations over the past number of years build on a strong relationship that the SEC had with stakeholders including the teacher unions and the school management representative bodies.  We have engaged through the advisory group on examinations planning and in bilateral meetings with the stakeholders just before Covid-19 and during Covid-19 and on these particular issues over the past year.  We have had much support from the teacher unions in terms of encouraging and supporting the campaigns that the SEC has put in place such as advertising in the teacher union magazines and directly reaching out to branch representatives on behalf of the State examinations system to try and increase the numbers getting involved.  In regard to the other measures that need to be put in place, the rates are quite significantly enhanced this year.  That has had an impact.  There are other factors in play.  It has recently been announced that there will be a comprehensive review of the factors underpinning issues with supply of teachers to undertake these critical roles with the State examinations.

Each year that there is a decrease in examiners, the experience of the examiners gets only more difficult, making it more challenging year-on-year to get new examiners in.  Where I come from, there was a leaving certificate student who, due to the timing of the leaving certificate results, was not able to access a place in a UK university.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been working with the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, on some of those issues.  That is a huge challenge in general for students accessing places.

On technology and what we have done, the figures we shared are quite stark as regards the increase in candidates and the more than matching decrease in the number of examiners.  We have invested in digitisation of the examinations over the last number of years.  Some 410,000 results were issued this year at leaving certificate level.  Of those, 389,000 were either fully or partially marked using our online marking system.  There is no doubt that the online marking system and that transition to online marking has assisted us in managing the challenge of a decreased examiner supply.  It makes the experience of examining much more straightforward and streamlined for the teachers involved.  That is one aspect of digitisation.<\/p> <p>  We made continuous improvements across all of our services in the last number of years with greater use of our candidate self-service portal.

All of those details are set out on the website.<\/p> <p>  It depends on the nature of the subject.  If a new specification or subject is introduced at leaving certificate level or in the junior cycle, we may not have a specific qualification in that subject but we look at and review the application in the context of what other relevant information is provided.  The key issue, as Ms Feeney mentioned earlier, is that we were prioritising the leaving certificate examinations this year.  They are the appointments we make first.  We take all our application forms and fill our teams at leaving certificate level first.  We then work to fill our junior cycle teams and assign our most experienced examiners to mark the leaving certificate examinations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>If we are not getting the examiners, and in fact there has been a 30% decrease, and teachers are not being attracted into taking on the examiner role, what will we do?

The number of examiners who marked junior cycle in 2019 was 1,756.  The number who marked junior cycle this year was 1,270.  However, at leaving certificate level, the numbers kept pace.  The numbers in 2019 and 2022 were similar.  That was very deliberate on our part.  We prioritised the marking of the leaving certificate in the assignment of examiners to the marking teams as we recognised the importance of the leaving certificate results to the students involved as regards progression.  I am not saying that the junior cycle results are unimportant but the leaving certificate results are important for students progressing to further and higher education and to the world of work.  The priority in the assignment of examiners was, therefore, given to the leaving certificate.  We want to increase the number of examiners available across the board so that we do not face this challenge at either leaving certificate or junior cycle level.  As to the reassurance we can give, as I have reflected already, we see this as a whole-of-system issue.  There are absolutely measures we need to take and work we need to continue with the stakeholders but it is a whole-of-system issue.  We have had offers of support from the management representative bodies.  We have worked very closely with them and with the teacher unions and we will continue to do so in order to deliver our system of examinations, which is externally assessed by the State Examinations Commission.  It is marked by teachers who are marking students for the State Examinations Commission.

In some subjects, there is a specific policy after X number of years that retired examiners are no longer recruited.  However, we must be very conscious of the reason we are here today, which is that we have an examiner-supply problem.  We have very few examiners working with us who have a long distance from the classroom and are out of it for 20 years.  What we are very conscious of is that we are very grateful to our retired examiners, because they bring a huge amount of experience, in particular to our senior examining teams as well.  We are conscious of that in terms of the robust training that we provide.  Very detailed resources are provided to all examiners.  While retired teachers can be distant from the classroom, equally, there is an issue with newly qualified teachers who have not clocked up the miles in the first place.  We provide very robust training materials and exemplars.  There is a lot of marking done on sampling material at the marking conferences in order that we are sure that we can robustly support and stand over the marking by all our examiners, not just retired or newly qualified ones.  Again, we have the quality assurance processes throughout in terms of getting material.  As I mentioned to Senator Dolan, the move to online marking is pretty much instantaneous.  If we have a situation with an examiner, we can immediately address that and put measures in place.  We are very appreciative and very lucky to have a core group of retired examiners.  As I mentioned previously, our priorities are in the criteria that are listed on our website on how we go about examiner appointments.  We apply those criteria and try to put the best quality examiners in place, while we are cognisant of the fact that we do have an examiner supply problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022102500002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>As Deputy O'Sullivan said, and from the experience of my own friends, both male and female, some of whom are single, the very minute they finish in the classroom they want to go travelling for the two or three months.

We must look at all the issues you mentioned, Chair, such as childcare, the fact that teachers have young families and that they have made a lifestyle choice and a career choice that is compatible with their family responsibilities.  We must look at the range of factors with the stakeholders and see how we can strike a balance so that the time demand for teachers getting involved is perhaps reduced so that there are more teachers doing this for a shorter period of time.  That is the objective that we have.  We want it to become a beneficial experience as well as one which increases their earning power.  With the increases in the script rate, the earnings can be significant.

In terms of what it would do at a logistical perspective for the SEC, I do not know.  I would have to give it some time to think about it.  It sounds to me like it could be quite disruptive to have examinations happening two months earlier in the school year.  If the students did their examinations in April instead of in June, what happens to them for the rest of the two months of the year?  It might be hard in terms of engaging at that point in time.  It is a question I had not considered previously.  There are teachers in classrooms at the moment who are very capable of giving advice about their level and also the subjects that they plan to take, and they do so.  That is for students who have gone directly into fifth year.  A lot of students go into transition year and they have the time they need to make up their mind.  Even for those who are in fifth year, there should be enough information available professionally in the school to give them that advice.

By now, members have already have heard the calls to action to avert catastrophe.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the catastrophe has already arrived and a rapid escalation of humanitarian aid into areas facing famine is needed.  While I am reading this statement,12 more people will have died in east Africa due to lack of food and related complications.<\/p> <p>  Since May of this year, estimates of the number of people across the world who will experience crisis levels of hunger in 2022 has risen from 181 million people in 41 countries to 345 million.  The G7 says 323 million people are on the brink of starvation.  The global hunger index released last week confirmed that hunger levels are reaching catastrophic proportions, with 44 countries suffering with serious or alarming levels of hunger.  There is no doubt but that the numbers will increase, given the millions displaced and lives up-ended in another recent climate crisis in Pakistan.  That we are experiencing an unprecedented global emergency is undisputed.  <\/p> <p>  I am joined today in person by R&eacute;iseal N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair of Concern Worldwide and Colm Byrne of Tr&oacute;caire.  I am very pleased to also be joined by Paul Healy, Tr&oacute;caire's country director for Somalia,and Dominic Crowley, Concern Worldwide's emergency director, who is also speaking to us from the region.  <\/p> <p>  Before I hand over to my colleagues, I will give a short update of what has changed since we last met the committee in June.  Back then, we said that one person was dying from hunger every 48 seconds in the Horn of Africa.  Now it is estimated that one person is dying every 36 seconds.  Back then, we knew there was a possibility the next rainy season due to start this month would fail.  Now we know for sure that this has happened, leaving communities facing into a fifth consecutive season of failed rains.  This is an historic situation by any accounts.  Back then, we warned that despite our help, hundreds of thousands of children would die for lack of food and adequate nutrition.  Now we are seeing children dying daily, many of whom have arrived too weak and too ill to health centres after long arduous journeys with their families.  <\/p> <p>  That anyone anywhere is dying of hunger in 2022 is unacceptable.  That any child would spend its first years knowing nothing but hunger should shock us all into action.  In recent months, both the Irish people and the Irish Government have acted.  The recent visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to Kenya and Ireland&rsquo;s announcement that it would allocate an additional &euro;30 million to the situation in the Horn of Africa for 2022 are to be particularly welcomed, as is the announcement of increased funding for overseas development aid in budget 2023.  On that, I thank the committee for its support and engagement with us and with the Government.  As with all funding, we ask that the release of such funding be expedited or more lives will be lost unnecessarily.  It is vital that Ireland continues to show solidarity with those who are living through the worst drought in 40 years.<\/p> <p>  COP 27, which takes place in two weeks' time, presents an opportunity to accelerate our global ambition to tackle the climate emergency and to place climate justice and human rights at the heart of climate action.<\/p><p>Climate security is now a critical issue that requires new thinking and new solutions.  No country in the G20 is decarbonising quickly enough to maintain a safe climate and that is putting more lives and livelihoods at risk, in particular in countries such as Somalia that have done little to contribute to the problem.<\/p><p> A critical issue for the communities with whom we work is that of loss and damage.  Countries in the global south are experiencing massive losses and damages from climate change impacts and have the least financial and technical resources to cope.  This is diverting much-needed public finance for sustainable development into dealing with the crises and is pushing countries further into debt.  It is a matter of climate justice that richer countries including Ireland contribute to and support the development of this third pillar of finance under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC. <\/p><p> We are asking all the committee members here today, as well as all Oireachtas Members, to support our call to action to Ireland, that is, to release flexible multi-year funding to meet the current humanitarian needs and that those funds reach as many NGOs and local organisations as possible who are the front-line responders; to continue to grow Ireland&rsquo;s budget in line with our commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI on official development assistance, ODA, by 2030; and to advocate at the UN Security Council and in relevant international forums for accountability for those who seek to use starvation as a weapon of war.  We ask Ireland to support the scale up of investment in social protection programmes and sustainable livelihoods to protect and strengthen hard-won development gains.  Last, we ask Ireland to support the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility at COP 27 and to follow the lead of other countries such as Denmark, and to commit initial loss and damage finance, as a sign of leadership on the issue.<\/p><p> We need political action and leadership to prevent this catastrophe from getting worse. Each day of delay exacerbates human suffering, increases the scale of the crisis and raises the cost of the response.  I will now hand over to Mr. Paul Healy who will speak about the reality on the ground in Somalia.  He will be followed by Mr. Dominic Crowley, after which my colleagues and I would welcome input from members and will answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":702,"content":"<p>It is a pleasure to be here and I thank members for taking the time.  Every week over the past six weeks I have been in Gedo and every week, I have seen children die or have heard the following morning that a child had died during the night.  Every week we are hearing of mothers and children coming into Dolow and Luuq in Gedo, having walked for a week or two weeks and barely having enough strength to get to our facilities.  Children have died on their way and have been buried on the side of the road in shallow graves because the parents or the mother is too weak to dig a deeper grave.  The situation is apocryphal and it is catastrophic.  In this day and age, it is a complete political failure and more needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  In 2011 we said, &ldquo;Never again&rdquo;.  Political leaders, UN agencies and others said, &ldquo;This will never happen again&rdquo;.  Now in 2022, it is happening all over again.  It is a political failure.  We are appreciative of the steps and the leadership taken by the Irish Government and Irish Aid in supporting the crisis in east Africa but more still needs to be done.  One would hope that there is leadership for Europeans and others in the global north to address this crisis.  Already we are too late for thousands and thousands of people who are going to die in the coming weeks or have died in the past few weeks.  Women and children in particular bear the brunt of this.  Over 80% of the people coming into internally displaced camps are women and children.  They are exposed to significant malnutrition as well as the risks of sexual exploitation and abuse.  Half a million children are currently starving in Somalia and 1.8 million children are reaching that point, along with 500,000 mothers who are pregnant or lactating and are struggling to survive and unable to feed their children.<\/p> <p>  A large reason for this is that climate change has not been properly addressed.  We have seen over years and years the global north exploiting the resources of this planet.  The people of Somalia have done little to contribute to that and yet there is little or no compensation to the Somali people for the consequences that they are now facing.  Some 3 million livestock animals have already died in Somalia.  A whole way of life has been destroyed.  It is simply unacceptable in this day and age to stand back and to not take heed of the consequences of our actions over decades. <\/p> <p> There are solutions to this if we act now.  Immediately, there are life-savings solutions.  We are deeply appreciative of the leadership and support of the Irish Government, the Irish public and Irish Aid but other long-term solutions need to be put in place that I hope COP27 will address and in which the Irish Government will take an active part.  As already has been said, we need multi-annual and predictable funding for durable solutions for sustainable livelihoods to try to address the impoverishment of people in the global south, particularly here in the Horn of Africa, where whole livelihoods have been destroyed and possibly forever.  I also appeal to the Irish Government to consider again the commitments that we have made over decades to the 0.7% of GNI.  While the current response is deeply appreciated, we can do more as Irish people.  The idea is in our DNA and in our historical memory that the poorest, the most marginalised and the most left behind should not be forgotten.  I make the passionate plea to the Members of the Oireachtas and to all the Irish public to take leadership and to show the compassion that is our historical right and is in our memory.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to it.  I will cover some of the same ground that Mr. Healy has already covered so my apologies for that.  As Ms McKenna has said, I am in Nairobi but I got in yesterday evening from Mogadishu.  I want to talk a little about the situation in Mogadishu and in Baidoa.  The time that I spent in Mogadishu and Baidoa gave me the opportunity to speak with our staff, with NGOs, both national and international, with the UN and with the minister for humanitarian aid for the state in which Baidoa lies.<\/p> <p>  The one message that everyone gave me is that this is the worst crisis in living memory.  It is worse than the famine in 1992 when Mary Robinson famously made her visit.  It is worse than the famine of 2016-17.  Between them, those two famines killed between 500,000 and 600,000 people.  It is unimaginable, as we have heard already, that we are facing another crisis of at least the same order of magnitude, not least because we have been shouting about the danger of this for the last 18 months.<\/p> <p>  I will speak about the things that I saw while I was in Mogadishu.  I visited a stabilisation centre in Banadir Hospital, which is the national referral hospital for mothers and children.  The ICU in the hospital would break your heart, with desperately emaciated children with multiple health complications as a result of acute malnutrition.  The admissions into the unit have more than doubled in the last couple of months and are running at more than twice the number for the same period last year.<\/p><p>We are helping as much as we can.  On the day after I visited, the slab was poured for a new unit that is being created.  The unit will only accommodate 45 children.  As the crisis deepens, which we all know it will, the capacity is inadequate for the level of need we will see.<\/p><p> I also visited one of our mother and child health, MCH, clinics in Mogadishu.  They were so overloaded by the caseload in the last couple of months that we have had to open a second MCH clinic close by.  The caseload is manageable but they are operating at very close to full capacity.  The focus in these clinics is on children under five and pregnant and lactating mothers, looking at giving them nutritional and health support and at giving health education to the mothers.  Standing inside the clinic, the youthfulness of the mothers was bluntly and brutally obvious.  One of the common distress factors we see at the start of a crisis is that young girls are married off to take them out of a household and remove the burden of having to feed them.  We saw that in Mogadishu and in the camps in Baidoa.  Even our national staff are surprised at how young these women are who are giving birth.<\/p><p> The first time I was in Baidoa was almost exactly 30 years ago, when I responded to the 1992-93 famine.  The situation is at least as bad now.  There are approximately 500,000 people living in camps north and south of Baidoa.  The population of the camps is greater than that of the town.  When we talk about camps, these are not formal, structured centres.  They are incredibly basic shelters of branches cut from trees and covered in sheets, blankets and, in some cases, tarpaulins.  This is where people are living.  Cooking is a couple of rocks outside with firewood put into them to try to cook on pots out in the open.  Water is provided from tap stands like that depicted on the slide.  Women and children queue to collect water in jerry cans.   That is their water for the day.<\/p><p> The image on the current slide is one I stole from Voice of America.  It depicts Baidoa camp.  To the front is a big grey slab, which is the water bladder.  That is what we fill at the start of each day.  Once it is emptied, it is more or less gone for the day unless we can get more water to it, which is becoming increasingly difficult.  Four wells out of hundreds dug in Baidoa in recent years remain operational.<\/p><p> We have had four failed rains.  We are facing into the fifth rain failure.  As Mr. Healy stated, 3 million livestock have died.  The land has become so dry that no crops have been planted or harvested.  Even if rain came, the soil is too hard for it to percolate effectively.<\/p><p> No discussion of Baidoa is complete without discussion of the role of al-Shabaab.  The women with whom I spoke said one of the main reasons they fled their areas - and, as Mr. Healy said, people walked for seven to ten days to get to this set of camps - was they were afraid their children would be conscripted.  The boys would be taken in to be al-Shabaab fighters and the young girls passed on as brides for older fighters.  They said that even if the rains came, they could not go back because the threat to their children remained.<\/p><p> This is measles in the camps and an uncontrolled outbreak of measles will kill children very quickly.  If we get rain in such unsanitary circumstances, we will, at the very least, get an increase in malaria and, in all likelihood, in serious waterborne diseases such as cholera.  At the moment, aid to the camps is pitifully low.  If people feel forced to migrate again, they will do so in a weakened state.  It is questionable as to how many of them will survive the journey.  Baidoa's nickname in Somali is \"Baidoa Janaay\".  It is far from that at present.<\/p><p> I do not know if people have seen or read the report from Andrew Harding that came out a few days ago.  It is well worth watching.  It tells the story of the first of the two little red bundles on the bed shown on the current slide.  It is a two-year-old boy.  This is the story of his death.  In the time before he died, he weighed 4.6 kg, not much more than a well-fed child at birth.<\/p><p> The issue of funding has been mentioned.  The UN appeal has increased to $2.27 billion.  This seems like a lot but, rationed out among the people who are supposed to received it, it equates to $440 per person.  The appeal has received less than half, 47.3%, of the funding.  This equates to $160 per person for the year, and that is to provide shelter, food, water and health.  It is woefully inadequate for the level of need we face.  It is no wonder the number of people in acute need of life-saving interventions is increasing dramatically, when we fail to provide the basics these people need.  If there is a bright light in this situation - and it is difficult to find - it is that the US has been responsive and provided 67% of all funding made available to the humanitarian response plan of the UN.  It is not the only funding mechanism, but it is the most important one.  We welcome the recent commitment from Irish Aid to support the response in the Horn but far more engagement is needed from all donors if famine and further unnecessary deaths are to be averted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Crowley, Ms  McKenna and Mr. Healy.

It is only now properly dawning on people in this country the scale of the problem in the Horn of Africa.  Few people were aware of it but it is percolating down now.  It is important that people know of it and understand it.  The witnesses' figures, stats and video clips are shocking.<\/p><p>Ms McKenna stated: \"While I am reading this statement,12 more people will have died in east Africa due to lack of food and related complications.\"  All of those figures were shocking, including that the number who have experienced crisis levels of hunger is up from 181 million people in 41 countries to 345 million now.  It was also stated that at one point in the Horn of Africa a person was dying from hunger every 48 seconds.  A few months later, a person is dying every 36 seconds.  It is no harm to read that into the record again.<\/p><p> This is a shocking horror story and it behoves us to do something about it.  It hits education and it hits women and children more.  All of those points are valid.  Ms McKenna mentioned speeding up aid and the money getting out there.  The committee will support that.  If there is anything we can do about the matter, including going to the Minister or whatever it takes, I would be in favour of doing it.  We should go on increasing the money for aid.  This is an emergency and there should be an emergency payment.  We have problems in Ireland but nothing in this compares with our domestic troubles so we should be supportive.<\/p><p> I was going to ask a few quick questions.  Ms McKenna stated, \"We ask Ireland to support the scale up of investment in social protection programmes and sustainable livelihoods\" and \"we ask Ireland to support the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility at COP27\".  Ms McKenna might elaborate on what exactly that is and if there is anything we could do in that regard.  The rest of it is self-evident and before I finish I want to indicate my support.  Any sane response to this would be that we should support the expedition of an increase in aid.  We should do something about it immediately.

There is no easy way of saying this, but I felt physically sick when I read the opening statement and saw that one death every 48 seconds is down to one every 36 seconds.  Naively, I had hoped, against all the evidence that it would hold somewhere in and around where it had been and that the increase in the number of deaths would not be as severe.  However, that lays bare, in very stark terms, the challenges that exist and the huge impact this is having across the countries that have been mentioned.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask some specific questions and then to dip into COP27.  When Mr. Crowley was speaking I was minded of the five usable wells left from the hundreds that have been dug.  Is the loss of those wells solely to do with climate change and the ground drying out or are there any other impacts involved?<\/p> <p>  In the run-up to COP27, I have been reading, as most people have how it is being framed as an African conference.  I would imagine that is being done in some ways to draw more attention to the crisis emerging there.  I am seeing and hearing about all this enhanced collaboration and new strategies.  In the context the countries that are most closely involved, the neighbouring countries and Egypt, is the urgency that seems to be expressed by them being reciprocated by others?  Is that same understanding being reciprocated through the actions of other countries?<\/p> <p>  The Santiago Network was established at COP26.  This was broadly welcomed at the time in the context of the loss-and-damage initiative, but are we seeing any meaningful outcomes from it?  It would be seen as a more long-term approach but are we seeing anything come out of that?  What I am hearing from the witnesses is that there have been pledges of support, some of which have yet to materialise, that there are short-term actions that need to happen now and that there are longer-term strategies required.<\/p> <p>  I also watched Andrew Harding's news report.  It broke my heart as a parent and a public representative.  Where the pledges of support are not coming through, is there anything we can do on the international stage to encourage them to come through a little bit stronger and more quickly?  Between the long-term strategy and the urgent need, what role can Ireland play in ensuring that the immediate need is met on an immediate basis?<\/p> <p>  I agree with everything that has been said about the disproportionate impact events like this have in the context of gender.  Whether it is sexual exploitation or abuse, additional resources are needed for pregnant women and nursing mums.  What can we do to address these issues?

If I said there are five wells, I meant to say there are four.  Apparently, there are only four usable wells in Baidoa.  That is for a combination of reasons.  The wells tap into the aquifer and the aquifer is not being replenished because the rains are not coming.  The Deputy heard that we have had four and a half failed rains, which we expect to become five, and that there has been no opportunity for the aquifer to be replenished.  As a result, there is no water to tap into.  The second aspect is the sheer volume of population.  You cannot increase the population of an area by 150% and expect scarce resources to spread widely enough to meet the extra demand.  It is a combination of those two factors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to explain loss and damage because our sense is that it is not always necessarily well understood.  We talk about ODA and international development assistance and we talk about this being equivalent to 0.7% of gross national income.  In addition to ODA we talk about climate finance.  Climate finance is for climate adaptation and mitigation.  The origins of the discussion around climate finance go back as far as 2009 in Copenhagen and were reinforced at COP21 in the Paris Agreement of 2015.  Climate finance is a commitment by the richest countries in the world to provide $100 billion to the least developed countries that are least able to respond to the challenges of the climate crisis.  The ODA target is 0.7% of gross national income and Ireland is only meeting half of that obligation.  We have climate finance for adaptation and mitigation and Ireland has committed &euro;225 million for same.  So far, we have only provided &euro;90 million.  Some estimates suggest that we should be providing as much as &euro;900 million per year.  That is 0.7% ODA, as much as &euro;900 million in climate adaptation and mitigation and then we have the separate issue of loss and damage.<\/p> <p>  Let me give the committee a practical example of what we mean by loss and damage.  If you can imagine that if you are living as temperatures rise, mitigation would be the opportunity to provide air conditioning to your house.  Adaptation would be the opportunity to get drought resistant seed, which would enable you to grow crops which are more conducive to the warming environment.<\/p><p>Loss and damage is what happens when it is no longer possible to adapt and mitigate.  It would be the equivalent of someone's house no longer being usable or inhabitable and their land no longer productive.  Our ask, as an aid community, is that Ireland should provide 0.7% and should move towards that target.  We should make those commitments in terms of climate finance.  This is an opportunity for us to provide a form of progressive leadership to the international community, particularly within the EU and among the world's most developed states, by making a landmark commitment to loss and damage.  Denmark has already set the standard.  It has provided a small amount of funding, equivalent to &euro;13 million.  This is an opportunity for Ireland to make a statement in advance of COP.<\/p><p> Deputy Clarke asked what we can do.  This is an opportunity for Ireland to provide leadership, to be the first and to demonstrate to others, in advance of COP27, what is possible and that we are committed to supporting loss and damage.  The Deputy mentioned the Santiago Network.  The Santiago Network is an opportunity to provide technical support to countries in addressing climate change, climate adaptation and mitigation.  The challenge is that it is equivalent to having an architect but having no money to build the house.  It is technical support but there is no financing behind it.  The ask is 0.7% plus the climate finance and the loss-and-damage funding, but the real opportunity is for Ireland to stand apart within the international community.  We exist at a time when the multilateral system is failing.  Many European countries are already starting to reduce aid budgets.  Ireland has taken an important step forward by increasing it quantitatively.  As others go low, it is important that we stay high, continue on this positive track and set the standard for others to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>There was a commitment from the international community, originating back in Copenhagen in 2009, with regard to climate finance.

The 2011 famine killed over 260,000 people.  As Mr. Crowley outlined, it has now been two and a half years without rain.  That is not just in Somalia but in the wider region, including parts of Ethiopia.  It is good to have the ambassador from Kenya here today as parts of Kenya are also very badly affected.  South Sudan is experiencing extreme flooding.  The action needs to be that we no longer treat this as business as usual.  We can see that the climate crisis is coming.  It is affecting people now.  It is a game changer in terms of how people can survive and how to replace people's livelihoods.  It is also coming on the back of the Covid crisis, which had already rolled back 20 years of development.  The emphasis needs to be on humanitarian funding, as Mr. Byrne said, but also on the longer term bilateral investments with countries that are struggling to provide levels of social protection and rebuild livelihoods for people.  We need to look right into the future.  This crisis in Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa is not going to be solved in six months.  A large caseload of people who were displaced in 2011 in similar circumstances due to moving away from conflict-affected areas are still displaced because it was not possible for them to go back to their land.  We have to look at the package and take a long-term view.  It is also important to acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to allocate &euro;30 million to the Horn of Africa after his visit.  It it very welcome.  As a strong principle leading donor, Ireland can also influence other donors.

The numbers are absolutely staggering.  When you see the images, you relate to the suffering.  We often talk about first world problems.  This is on a different scale altogether.  Mr. Crowley said this is the worst famine in living memory, worse than 1992.  I remember when Mary Robinson was out there and she broke down emotionally when she met people in the camps.  You can understand why.  I note from some briefing documents that the threshold may not yet have been reached at UN level for an official declaration of famine.  In the name of God, what is the threshold if we are not at it already?  If the UN did declare a famine, what difference would it make?  Would it make a difference?  I know some work has been done but it has been vetoed by some countries at UN level.  The Security Council has its own issues.  I am glad Ireland is doing what it is doing but we obviously need to do more and take the lead.

A declaration does not make any difference to that child or that mother.  It does not make any difference to the suffering of people.  Months ago, I said that we are already mitigating the impact of famine.  It is already here and is already expressing itself.  Yes, some of the indicators have not been completely reached, but that depends on the famine review committee having the ability to measure specific indicators and having the time to do that.  They only do that over a period.  We are waiting for the next assessment and collection of data from the famine review committee before that famine is declared, but the crisis is now.  Perhaps members will recall that 100,000 people died in 2011 before famine was declared.  We certainly want to try to avoid that happening again.  We want to avoid mothers and children starving in Somalia and wasting away to nothing as we wait for this amazing declaration.  It is not good enough.  We must do more.  I really appreciate the compassion, the intelligence and the commitment shown by the members here today around pushing this and early action, rather than waiting for a famine to be declared.

When we talk about famine we talk about IPC, which is the integrated food insecurity phase classification.  This system was created a few years ago to try to get us past the argument of whether this is a famine or is not a famine.  The problem is that this is extremely conservative in its estimates and, as Mr. Healy has noted, is that it measures things retrospectively.  By the time a famine is identified it is already well under way.  The specific challenge, generally speaking, in proving IPC level 5 is to identify the retrospective mortality data.  One is trying to look backwards and trying to assess how many children have died in the previous period relative to a nominal baseline of child mortality.  That is extremely difficult, not least because, as Mr. Healy has said, when one sees patterns of distress migration, which is when people try to move from one area to another in search of food, that is when one sees the highest rate of deaths.  It is then almost impossible to identify the graves subsequently.  At the moment in Somalia, the World Health Organization is trying to look at that retrospective mortality data, but whether it will come up with accurate information, and whether the information it comes up with will be sufficient to meet the threshold, is very questionable.  I 100% agree with Mr. Healy in saying that this is totally academic.  We should have been responding months ago on the understanding that there is a famine, irrespective of what the technical definition says.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>I will hand over to Mr. Byrne to clarify some of those points regarding the loss and damage initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022102500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I reiterate what Mr. Healy and Mr. Crowley said.  We have seen multiple red flags over the past 18 months.  To wait for a declaration of famine is not really acceptable.  It is to imply that people should suffer but that there is a certain level of suffering at which we suddenly draw a red line and say \"This is enough\".<\/p> <p>  On the resistance to loss and damage, I must say that it is the EU, the US, and Australia and others.  Part of the resistance is a refusal to acknowledge the historic accountability and the risk of litigation.  The establishment of a loss-and-damage fund in some ways would replace that.  It is about trust in many ways.  Ultimately, however, it is about accountability.<\/p> <p>  The question was asked about what parliamentarians can do.  It is about telling the story, keeping this visible, and keeping it on the agenda of Government.  I do not just mean within the Oireachtas; I also mean within the communities where we live and to understand the implications of our own individual and collective responsibility for climate change and acknowledging that while we may have the luxuries we have here, there are many people in other parts of the world who do not have the buffer against the sorts of climatic implications we are seeing right now.  There is also the opportunity to impress upon parliamentarians in other countries.  This is where we talk about Ireland being first in providing that progressive leadership.  The opportunity then is to provide that on the international stage and encourage other member states and parliamentarians elsewhere to make similar decisions.<\/p> <p>  I apologise that I misunderstood the Vice Chairman's previous question on the climate finance and the &euro;100 billion element.

Deputy Stanton brought us back to Mary Robinson's visit to the region in the early 1990s and the huge impact that famine had, not only here but it also had a chilling effect across the world.  Thankfully it led to greater help and assistance being afforded.  When we consider the difficulties we as a nation have had in recent years in responding to and rebounding from Covid as a people, as a country and as an economy.  When we think of the mitigating measures we had to take in the recent budget in order to respond to the issues arising out of supply chains being affected by Covid and by the war in Ukraine, and the impact this is having on the cost of living and when we consider that we can do that to the tune of &euro;11 billion and not borrow a cent to do so, we realise that as badly off as we think we are, how very much well-off we are when compared with the terrible difficulties and tragedies experienced by the people to whom our guests refer.<\/p> <p>  As a committee comprising members from all parties and none and representative of the people who give us the privilege of being here as Members of the Houses, we have a duty.

We must also acknowledge, with regard to climate financing and the &euro;95 million against &euro;225 million, that this compares far more advantageously than the 25% across the international community.  That is not to say that when one makes a commitment one should not stand by it: one should not make commitments unless one has the capacity to do so.  Our job will be to impress upon Government the need to be expedient in relation to the commitment it has made as a Government: to use its influence in the fora to which it is party, both within the EU, within the UN and within the Security Council and to ensure that our Government's representation at COP27 has at the top of its agenda issues relating to climate finance and loss and damage, as you have alluded to.  We will do our utmost to do that expediently ourselves, and to immediately contact Government to relay the shock and horror that is obvious in the voices of the responses and sentiment of those members that are here, in the hope that our people as a whole recognise that no matter how difficult things may seem, it is a far cry from the presentations that have been given to us on behalf of those you wish to support here today.

You are all welcome.  I thank you all for the opening statements which have been circulated to the members.  You also submitted your housing delivery action plans.  The purpose of these meetings is to look at the historical delivery of housing and the different types of housing that have been delivered over the last couple of years.  It is also to look at the projected delivery in line with Housing for All.  We agreed this morning that we will have a couple more meetings after which the committee will put a report together, and submit it with our recommendations and observations from engagement with local authorities.<\/p> <p>   I will read a brief note on privilege before I ask for opening statements.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  For witnesses attending in the committee room, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Before we hear opening statements, I want to explain to our witnesses that we take it in seven minute segments.  That means members have seven minutes to ask questions and receive answers.  If we stick to those seven minutes we can sometimes get in a second round of questions.

The housing delivery shown in our opening statement is for the period 2017-2021.  The committee asked for three years but we included five to give a better feel for the comparison between that five year period and the current one.  We delivered 2,392 units, and 5,300 housing assistance payment, HAP, households also benefitted from housing accommodation policy.  The leap going forward in terms of step change is very significant where we are looking to provide 3,699 social homes and 1,566 affordable homes.  The significant step change is largely associated with the introduction of Housing for All and the introduction of the affordable sale and cost-rental streams.  In our case that is assisted by two significant issues.  One issue is the substantial block of funding of approximately &euro;186 million of the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, for the Clonburris strategic development zone, SDZ, which will allow for the advance development of all enabling common infrastructure.  Clonburris SDZ is a housing project for 8,500 homes, and South Dublin County Council has 2,500 homes within that.  That is really important, as is the additional financing of resources and the fact that we have, in the last five years, gone from developing smallish sites ranging from ten homes, to the biggest one, which I think was 90 homes.  That is a lot of firefighting, planning permission and contracting and site management.  We are going from that into managing about a half dozen sites, the smallest of which will comprise maybe 300 to 400 units at a time.  Those three issues are facilitating that step change, and that represents our ambition for the next five years.  <\/p> <p>  We have considerably increased our activity with regard to right-sizing.  There is a confluence of issues for us, one of which is ageing demographics that is common across Ireland, and particularly in parts of south Dublin inside the M50, one of the older suburbs in Dublin city and county.  There is also a degree of analysis by Tallaght University Hospital around this.  Our age friendly committee through my colleague, Mr. Ward's team have also done work around it.  The numbers going forward are fantastic in terms of life expectancy and so forth but demanding in terms of the State.<\/p> <p>  Alongside that we have significant issues around under-occupation of social homes, which comes to about 1,100 or 11%.  People obviously have the right to reside in those homes.  What we are trying to do through our right-sizing policy is encourage people voluntarily to move within their own locality to a right-sized home, providing they are comfortable with that and it fulfils their life expectations moving forward.  There will be no obligation on anyone to move.  We also have one site under construction, three sites at the tender stage, and four sites at the planning stage.  That is eight sites all together, ranging in size from about 12 to 16 in terms of small clusters of housing within existing communities.  We also have two or three larger developments, including one for 80 apartments.  That is it on right-sizing.  We also have a right-sizing policy that allows people to buy into it from private housing on the surrender of their homes.<\/p> <p>  On Part V, the statistics speak for themselves.  On vacancy and dereliction, as a local authority administrative area, we have the lowest vacancy rate in Ireland over the last two census periods.  That is reflected in the lack of activity on repair and renew and on the various Government initiatives.  For our part, we have brought derelict properties back into use, including three for social housing and two for lease.  There are also four derelict properties in one location going through the compulsory purchase order, CPO, process under the derelict sites Act.<\/p><p>Broadly speaking, that is a synopsis of the opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members for the invitation to address them today.  We have a good track record in Fingal of delivering social homes for the county.  Since 2019, we have delivered in excess of 5,000 units.  Of those, 847 were direct build and the figures for other forms of social housing can be seen in the paper we submitted.  Looking ahead then in terms of Housing for All we are committed to increasing our social housing delivery.  We work with all delivery partners to ensure that housing is available for everybody in society.<\/p> <p>  As part of the Housing for All plan, we have developed a housing action plan 2022 to 2026.  It sets out the details of all social housing delivery for the next five years.  It summarises the current and projected housing delivery which will be delivered to meet the targets set for the council by the Department.  The table provided outlines the delivery targets for 2022 to 2026.  That is a total of 3,640 units over those years and 3,286 of those are to be direct build.<\/p> <p>  The council plans to deliver a total of 361 new build social homes this year and that is against a target of 360.  It is committed to delivering the target of 690 new builds for 2023 and targets of more than 700 new build social homes for the subsequent years up to 2026.  Fingal County Council has been proactive in the delivery of social housing and over the past three years the council has provided housing solutions for more than 5,000 families.  This has been through a range of delivery mechanisms, including new build, leasing and the housing assistance payment, HAP.  <\/p> <p>  Having said that, the last few years have challenging.  Covid-19 has hampered the building of new houses.  It has caused disruption to the construction sector and hindered supply chains.  The high construction price inflation and market uncertainty have also impacted housing delivery.  However, Fingal County Council is committed to delivering good quality social and affordable homes for our citizens and to achieving all the targets set out.<\/p> <p>  To meet the significant challenges of delivery set out in the Housing for All plan, the council has an ambitious housing construction programme delivering both social and affordable housing on its own land banks.  The table provided sets out the projected pipeline to 2026.  In the period 2015 to 2021, 536 social housing units were built on council land.  Moving ahead, the pipeline is 1,933.  That includes a combination of construction on site and those that are in the planning stage and in the pre-planning stage.<\/p> <p>  Part V delivery continues to be an important delivery mechanism.  A total of 405 new social homes were delivered under Part V in the period 2019 to 2021. A further 116 dwellings are in the pipeline to be delivered in 2022.  There are currently a total of 609 active construction sites across the county with a total of 2,932 units under construction.  New Part V social homes will be coming from those private sites.  The future social housing provision of Part V is dependent on delivery by the private construction sector.<\/p> <p>  In advance of the introduction of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 and the regulations, Fingal devised a pilot affordable scheme at Dun Emer in Lusk, delivering 39 affordable and 12 social homes.  These homes are scheduled to be delivered by year end.  The next development will be on site in Hayestown, Rush, in the coming weeks delivering 52 affordable and ten social homes.  The first phase of delivery on our major land bank at Church Fields, Mulhuddart, Dublin 15, is currently at procurement stage.  This phase will deliver 108 affordable purchase and 80 cost-rental homes. <\/p> <p>  There are four cost rental schemes approved under the cost rental equity loan, CREL, scheme being delivered by our affordable housing body, AHB, partners.  These schemes are scheduled to deliver 14 cost-rental homes this year and 170 in 2023.  Working with our partners in the Land Development Agency and the approved housing bodies, it is expected that more than 3,000 affordable homes will be delivered in Fingal in the period 2022 to 2026.  The table provided outlines this projected delivery by each partner.  That is a total of 3,079 units.<\/p> <p>  The delivery of accommodation for older persons is a priority for the council.  A scheme of 30 apartments specifically designed for older people was delivered last year in partnership with Fold Housing.  A further 31 homes will be under construction by Tuath Housing on the council owned land bank in Lusk this year.  The council is currently drafting a pilot right-sizing scheme which will accommodate both social and private homeowners.<\/p> <p>  The preliminary census 2022 data indicates that Fingal has the second lowest vacancy rate in the country at 4.28%.  It is likely that many of these properties will not be vacant when the data is further analysed.  Since 2019, a total of 70 privately-owned properties have been brought back into occupancy.  That is through the repair and lease scheme, the buy and renew scheme, compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, and through the private market.<\/p> <p>  The council also recognises the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme, particularly the refurbishment grant scheme of a maximum of &euro;50,000 which will bring some of those properties back into use.  The council has a full-time vacant homes officer in place since April 2022.  The officer and the team will deal with the 85 vacant or potentially vacant, private dwellings that are at the various states of investigation, engagement or action.  Some of the properties are in the process of going through probate or conveyancing or may be subject to repair or form part of a planning application.  The council is actively tracking the progress with these properties and expects they will return to occupancy as the various processes reach conclusion.  The council&rsquo;s vacant homes officer will also be participating in a pilot project with the Department and five other local authorities around the data on potential vacant properties across the country.<\/p> <p>  Fingal County Council assesses dereliction in accordance with the Derelict Sites Act 1990.  There are currently six sites with 17 properties on the derelict sites register.  The council continues to pursue dereliction by way of engagement with owners and occupiers, the issuing of statutory notices and the placement of sites on the register.  As a result, the council has engagement with the owners of all these sites.  The council hopes to be in a position to remove three of the six sites from the register in the near future.  The use of the register will continue as a means to engage with owners and occupiers to deal with matters around dereliction and the return of properties to use.<\/p> <p>  Fingal County Council continues to build on its good track record of delivering both social and affordable housing.  As outlined above, there is a significant pipeline already in place and together with our delivery partners we are committed to delivering the target 6,532 social and affordable homes as set out in the housing action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms AnnMarie Farrelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I thank both local authorities for being with us today.

It is easier to go in and build social units directly without the mixed tenure part, but it is not necessarily the right thing to do.  Mr. McLoughlin mentioned some big areas of land.  Similarly, in Fingal, we have sites that can take about 1,000 units.  One example is Donabate, which is 1,000 units on public lands and a combination private, social and some cost-rental units.  That is financed by private finance, which adds additional complexity.<\/p><p>It is in the planning system at present.  We anticipate it will go to site soon thereafter but it can take up to three or four years for that scheme to be brought through development.  Much of the work is hidden and not understood.  In the case of Church Fields we have moved to another site of 1,000 units.  We will get on site with 300 of those by the end of next year.  The Part 8 process is a two to three year process.

I will not use the term &quot;take care of&quot; but we are dealing with a situation where the approved housing bodies, AHBs, require land and we are anxious to progress mixed tenure communities across all of the various Government schemes; that gives us the best opportunity to do it, all as part of one conversation.  It is therefore worth quite a bit of pain.<br\/><br\/>When we get to Part 8 we keep talking about the public spending code and the four stage process.  Since our troubles in 2008 and 2011 we have a public spending code and all approval processes including housing, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, URDF or major capital spending<b><\/b>projects mirror that process.  In considering adjustments to that we need to reflect on the need for a public spending code and how we might deal with that or provide more agility within it.<br\/><br\/>Working against that framework, when we come through come planning we are effectively through two stages of the process.  We must then take a planning consent, which is an outline design proposal, to detailed design stage.  We have two choices.  We can design it in-house, get architects to design it or go to the market for a design and build solution.  I said two, but it is really two and a half options.  That takes 12 months either way.  During that 12 month window, we also need to carry out all of the environmental assessments, ground, archeological and heritage surveys and so on.  That is a lot of moving parts and, as I said earlier, the management of all the sub-consultants within the timeframe, some of whom are season dependent, is quite tricky.  <br\/><br\/>We then get to the detailed design stage where approval is needed again.  Then we go to tender which is a two stage process when developing at scale.  Stage 1 is to ask interested parties to put their names forward to adjudicate on their capacity and competency to undertake a project at scale.  At that point we move to stage 2.  Unfortunately there is currently a degree of hesitancy between stage 1 and stage 2.  People who enter stage 1 do not necessarily stay in the race for stage 2.  The two stage process is another timing issue.  Then we get the final tender and that has to be approved.  Then we go to site.  As regards the timescale outlined to the committee - if we assume there is a conversation in a council chamber or an area committee about a greenfield site without any development or infrastructure constraints - from concept and from broad understanding at council level to handing over a key, four years is good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending the committee and ask them to thank their teams because they are at the coal face of the housing crisis.

South Dublin County Council residents have not been shy about coming forward for the first-home shared equity scheme and I understand a number of them have already received their certificates of eligibility.  As of June 2022, construction of 4,000 homes had started in the previous 12 months and 1,000 new homes were completed in that time.  All of us on the ground in the constituency see that every day.  We see hoardings up, boots on sites and cranes in the skyline in Liffey Valley, Clondalkin, Lucan, the N4 and in the villages.  All of those sites represent families, couples and single people who will end up in those homes and that is welcome.<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses know, housing is a massive issue in our area.  It is a particularly big issue in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West and South Dublin County Council's housing delivery plans focus more heavily on Dublin-Midwest than Dublin South-West.  We are home to two strategic development zones, Adamstown and Clonburris, and nearly 70% of social homes in the council's pipeline are due to be delivered in Dublin Mid-West rather than Dublin South-West.  That is welcome and I want to ensure we get it right.  What I mean by that is that we deliver homes hand-in-hand with infrastructure and the URDF funding that Mr. McLoughlin mentioned means that the likes of the Celbridge link road will open in the coming weeks.  That will provide much anticipated traffic congestion relief in Lucan.  Funding like that is being and must be used to build roads, schools and amenities that need to come hand-in-hand with those quite large-scale projects.<\/p> <p>  Second, I reiterate it is important that we deliver the right tenure and mix of homes.  In September 2019 South Dublin County Council sought expressions of interest in affordable homes.  I was a councillor at the time and it was something I was keen to do because even then when no national affordable housing scheme was in place, we had an affordability issue in Dublin and especially in Dublin Mid-West.  Now as a Deputy one of the biggest concerns I hear from young people and their parents is that they will not be able to afford to buy their own homes.  Some 2,000 people applied for that back then and the council's housing needs demand assessment, HNDA, estimates 2,500 more people have affordability problems.  The national target is 1,200 affordable purchase homes over the five or seven years since 2019.  Is that enough and is the right balance being struck?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#D00800","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":782,"content":"<p>There is a lot in that.  On the Deputy's first point, I thank her for acknowledging the work of the team and the councillors in south Dublin.  Good work is being done.<\/p> <p>  I can reassure the Deputy on the accompanying infrastructure piece.  Apart from the Celbridge link road the Deputy mentioned, she will be aware that in Adamstown we are developing two parks at scale.  One at Tandy's Lane opened last year at the cost of &euro;5 million and one at Airlie Park will open in January 2023 at a cost of &euro;5 million.  Lucan leisure centre that cost &euro;14 million will hopefully open next year.  There is much advance and retrospective provision of playing grounds and team spaces.<\/p><p>In fairness, the Department of Education has stepped up with us on site acquisition from us and other sites regarding the development of schools.  There are five cr&egrave;ches within the Adamstown strategic development zone, SDZ, where there are currently 3,500 homes.  We have our arms around that.  I appreciate that there was a hiatus in the Deputy's backyard.  There was an expansive growth area in Lucan in the Celtic tiger era that hit a brick wall in 2008 and then there was a delay.  We are retrofitting a lot of stuff there in the past five years and that is going pretty well.  <\/p><p> On the mixed tenure piece, we have about 50:50 social and affordable housing in Kilcarbery, which has 1,000 homes.  The Deputy will be well familiar that when we first tendered, the affordable housing schemes were not in place.  Since they have come in we have been able to bring on board though CREL and other schemes some affordable initiatives to rebalance that into a 50:50 situation.  Clonburris is 40% social, 30% affordable and 30% cost-rental across 2,500 homes.  We are getting the mix pretty right.<\/p><p> I will now answer on the expressions of interest piece on affordable housing and whether the numbers are high enough.  Apart from the 10% ordinarily in play, as part of the URDF, which does not get spoken about often, we got &euro;20 million in funding  in Adamstown.  Part of that proposition was an agreement for the sale of 2,000 homes, 1,100 of which had to be below a certain price point.  That has been achieved in the past three years.  As part of the Kilcarbery proposition, in the absence of an affordable scheme, we built in 50 homes discounted to the market.  As part of the URDF proposition in Clonburris we are factoring in an additional 10% affordable on top of the statutory requirement, which is an additional 600 affordable homes.  In those initiatives alone, the over and above proposition beyond the statutory 10% is quite significant.  <\/p><p> We are still exploring options and we are waiting to see whether we will have an affordable cost-rental development ourselves that has just come through tender in Belgard, Tallaght.  That will be important to us in assessing where that opportunity is at going forward and how we might make that work with assistance from the Department and if we can make it work, how it might be replicated in other locations.

Can I get a sense from each of the local authorities of how big the social housing lists are in terms of numbers and on average, how long is it taking for somebody to be allocated a home?  Is there any indication of how many people have been turned down in terms of the social housing lists in 2021 and 2022 on the basis of not satisfying the income limits?  As I am sure everyone is aware, income limits have not been revised since 2011.  There is a report with the Minister at the moment but I want to get a sense of how many people are applying and being turned down.  If the social housing income limits were increased by 10%, how many more people would then be coming on to the list?  <\/p><p>Cost rental is 306 for South Dublin County Council but I would also like to get a sense of what the demand for those planned cost-rental units is?  Then I want to come back to figures the witnesses might not have.  This is the number of people in 2022 presenting to homeless action who are coming from the private rented sector.  Do the witnesses have an idea of how many people with an eviction ban put in place would be presenting to the councils from homelessness from the private rented sector?  If the witnesses have that information would they also have a breakdown of those who would be in receipt of social support and those who would not be?  In this way, we could get an idea of what the numbers for the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme could potentially be.  That is an awful lot questions and I understand if the witnesses do not have the information with them.<\/p><p>I would like to ask both local authorities about the operation of the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme.  What blockages are being encountered and what issues are the local authorities facing where acquisitions cannot be made?

The average time for people to be accommodated is approximately seven years when all the priorities people get, including medical priority, to accelerate their time to be accommodated, are taken into account.

I will come back to the Senator about the time on the list.  I do not want to give an incorrect figure.  The Senator asked what the impact of the social housing 10% limit increase would be.  We can come back to the Senator about that to see what the impact might be.<\/p> <p>  On the cost-rental demand, in Fingal we have projected affordable housing delivery of over 3,000 during that timeframe, which is a mix of purchase and cost-rental.  We are looking at around 2,000 cost-rental, I think, over that timeline.  It is hard to put a measure on demand.  The criteria may be slightly different for the approved housing bodies.  There is no local authority in this space delivering cost-rental yet.  It remains to be seen how soon this may operate in practice.  On the number of families presenting as homeless, there were 568 as of 18 October this year.  We have 180 families overholding on notice to quit, that we are aware of.  I referred in my earlier answer to how we are assessing or dealing with those expressions of interest.  Generally speaking, people selling the property will approach us.  They contact us and we provide the information.  We also get that information from tenants or through our HAP processes.  We would also consider it where a tenant may be at risk of homelessness but we have not gotten direct contact from the landlord.  Everything is on a case-by-case basis.  We are conscious that by not dealing with it we may be dealing with a homeless situation that impacts our services elsewhere.  It is something we are giving careful consideration to.

They are challenging environments.  They are to be commended on their great achievements over recent years.<\/p><p>It is welcome to see that, combined between both councils, between social and affordable homes, we are up around 12,000 homes.  That is ambitious and welcome, and it will go a long way to meeting the need.  The fact witnesses have demonstrated how local authorities can deliver quantum, high quality and can use State-owned lands to address the cost and affordability issues is to be commended.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses mentioned affordable pricing starting at &euro;166,000.  I welcome Deputy Gould's welcoming of the strong Government policy that has enabled delivery on that affordable price.  He should consider supporting us a bit more because you never know what we could achieve together.  On a serious note, the changed circumstances and the double digit construction inflation the witnesses mentioned is very real and anybody who is trying to do any work in their own home will know that.  Delivery of affordability into the future and affordable cost rental will be critical.  I appreciate witnesses cannot give us an actual rental price, but the fact they are working to deliver at a minimum of 25% below market rents is what people need to know they are actually doing.<br\/><br\/>In terms of increasing the output, I believe Mr. McLoughlin said it was four years from start to finish for a project.  I agree with him, and if it was four years, we would all be able at least to work with that certainty.  From my experience from a city perspective it can actually take a decade and sometimes longer, which is a big challenge for the city.  One of the big challenges in the city is the planning process, which was mentioned, and the delays the process can cause, specifically when planning permissions are objected to and are caught up in the process.  Will witnesses speak to how that is impacting or will impact on their pipelines going forward?<br\/><br\/>I would also like to ask about the homeless services.  Dublin City Council operates the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  Between the two local authorities I believe there are around 1,200 applicants identified as homeless or at risk of homelessness.  How many emergency homeless accommodations are they providing in their local authority areas?  How many of those who are on their homeless lists or identified as being homeless are actually being accommodated in emergency accommodation in the city?  If the witnesses do not have that number to hand, they can come back to me with it.  I would like to understand that.<br\/><br\/>The costs are very challenging, but the last estimate I had of the cost of emergency accommodation for a family for a year is &euro;80,000.  Is that a charge the witnesses would identify as being the cost?  It is important that, if that is the case, we keep that in mind when we talk about the cost of new builds.  No emergency accommodation is a substitute for an actual home.<br\/><br\/>As for the tenants <i>in situ<\/i>process, have witnesses instructed their housing officers to ask, when someone who is on the housing list comes to them with a notice to quit, if the landlord is selling and if he or she will sell to the local authority?  If not, would the witnesses consider doing that?<br\/><br\/>The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is being extended to the cities, something my party colleagues and I have pushed hard for.  I am concerned about the value of &euro;50,000 for a vacant and derelict property or &euro;30,000 for a vacant property in the city.  Do the witnesses think that will be sufficient to trigger a renovation and regeneration of vacant and derelict properties in their local authorities?<br\/><br\/>I appreciate there are a lot of questions, but perhaps we could start with Fingal County Council and then move to South Dublin County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#J03100","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick and I might ask Mr. Burns to come in on some of those questions.

The four Dublin authorities have addressed that in their individual ways by retrofitting social infrastructure and planning infrastructure, rather than just housing, as they go.  That is one clear point.  I will also reiterate my colleague's point that everything is local.  Whereas it may seem rather simplistic to not understand why people from Tallaght might not want to live in Clondalkin or the other side of the M50, these are issues of significant importance to people who grow up locally.

There will be a proportion of social housing involved.  My first question is when it might be anticipated that the first new tenants move in?  Will it be before the end of this year or are we looking at 2023?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is rightsizing, which is outside the witnesses control and in respect of which they clearly do not have powers.  It was anticipated locally that the 110 duplexes would be for sale.  It was never specified in the planning application that they would be build-to-rent units but it looks like they will.  This represents a major opportunity missed for people in a settled area who live in three-, four- or five-bed houses and who would like to remain in the area.  These individuals will not remain in the area to rent but they would remain if they could buy.  Is there anything we can learn from this matter?  I live in the heart of the area, and this is really a missed opportunity.  The local authority is not to blame.  Is there something we can learn from this?

The Deputy is right to bring this up.  We discussed this privately before.  When he was a councillor, two development plans evolved - not the current one but the one before that.  For the first time, we introduced a proactive policy to encourage developments around rightsizing in the private sector.  That has not taken hold at all, and it is difficult to understand why.  Developers are probably more interested in developing at that scale.  We cannot stipulate on planning permissions that a certain proportion of homes should be set aside for rightsizing.  That is not envisaged in current planning policy at least.<\/p> <p>  On the rental-purchase side, it is only a hunch or a reaction to the Deputy's question, but I suggest that renting is quite lucrative in his neighbourhood.  That is why developers are holding on to a portion of developments for long-term rental in quality locations.  Mr. Ward can go through the detail of our scheme, which allows the opportunity for people to downsize and move into local authority-led developments.  There is a formula for that.  We have a rightsizing homes officer whose daily job is to speak to people about that opportunity on both sides, namely, the social housing side and the private housing side.  Mr. Ward can give the statistics as to how that is going.  It is going quite well.  It is a key part of our housing strategy going forward.  As we bring forward developments, hopefully the quality of them will entice more people to engage on that issue.  It is an obvious problem.  As already stated, on our social side we have an 11% rate of under-occupation.  I am sure that is replicated in the part of Dublin that the Deputy lives in, with large houses and large gardens-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022102500002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":976,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.

At the site on the Ratoath Road there is a really bad stretch of road from Reilly's Bridge towards Cappagh Hospital.  It is a dangerous road for anybody to live on.  Entering on to it is not great and the Traveller halting site there does not have a good safe entrance onto that road.  It is very dangerous and unsightly.  Could Fingal County Council come back to me with a report on its plans for that?  I do not need a specific answer today. <\/p><p> As regards the housing lists, both witnesses have indicated an average time historically of around six to seven years from when somebody applies to the local authority for housing to actually being housed.   I assume, but I would like witnesses to confirm, that in that interim period of six to seven years all applicants receive a housing assistance payment and are being accommodated in private rented accommodation.  It is only if the private rental accommodation is being sold and they received a notice to quit that they potentially face homelessness.  I would come back to the value for money question between a family being put into emergency homeless accommodation at a cost of &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 per year versus long-term leasing solutions.  My experience in the city of long-term leasing are brand new, A energy-rated apartments and homes that have been built to the highest standards and are often furnished.  They are on a long-term lease of somewhere between 15 and 25 years, which if we take the cost of &euro;300,000 works out at about &euro;12,000 per year.  Is that a fair description of what is happening in Fingal and south County Dublin and if their local authorities use long-term leasing?  If that is the case are they really comfortable with eliminating long-term leasing over the next five to six years?  <\/p><p> My final question is how their local authorities are being impacted by the arrival of Ukrainians and international protection refugees?

It is to do with probably historical maintenance of the housing stock across Ireland generally.

Fingal is part of another pilot project with the housing delivery co-ordination office looking at a planned maintenance project for all of the housing stock.

The topic before the committee today is the enforcement of court orders relating to child maintenance, access and custody.  This is one of our family law topics.  The committee takes elective modules and matters of interest to members of the committee every so often.  That is the subject of today's hearing.  Our guests might raise their hands as I go through the attendance if their names are not on the title bars in front of them.  I welcome Ms Louise Bayliss, the co-founder of Single Parents Acting for the Rights of our Kids, SPARK; Ms Karen Kiernan from One Family; Ms Stephanie Whyte, assistant director of children's services at Barnardos; Mr. Damien Peelo, chief executive officer of Treoir; Ms Gayle Smith, information and policy office of Treoir; Mr. Mark Garrett, director general of the Law Society of Ireland; and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, senior counsel, director of policy at the Law Society of Ireland.  All our guests are sitting in the order in which they appear on my list, which is a good start.  We are on message and on sequence so far.<\/p> <p>  I will address a small bit of housekeeping before we get into the matters proper.  All our guests are probably familiar with the conduct of hearings here and in similar bodies.  However, I will recap on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they may be directed to discontinue these remarks.  Members will be aware of that.  I call on members and witnesses not to defame anybody outside the room.  That is the simple way of putting it.  I am sure our guests and members are well aware of that but it is important to repeat at the outset.<\/p> <p>  All of the business performed today will be recorded and broadcast live on the Oireachtas channels.  I ask attendees who have mobile phones or other devices to switch them to airplane mode because otherwise they might interfere with the recording and sound system.<\/p> <p>  The way we conduct our business is to take short opening statements from our witnesses to set the scene.  We will come to each of our guests in due course.<\/p><p>They will have three minutes in which to make those opening statements.  It is reasonably short but we set that time because it allows for more time later for the to-and-fro, which we find can be more useful.  We will then have six minutes for each of our members to put their questions to the witnesses.  We will go around the table in the order members indicate and take one member at a time.  There is a six-minute slot for that member to ask questions and for the witnesses to respond.  It is up to individual members whether they want to have six one-minute engagements or a six-minute monologue.  Each member has a mandate so I will not interfere with that.  I will, however, move it on after six minutes to the next member who is coming in.  If needs be, we will then have a second round of three minutes and so on.  Generally, we find that if somebody really wants to respond to an item, it is very likely that it will arise in the following interaction anyway so everybody at the meeting will hopefully have their say across the different interactions.  The order in which the opening statements will be taken is the same order in which I introduced the witnesses.  For convenience, we have a clock in the corner that we use for housekeeping.  The witnesses might keep an eye on that as they are speaking in order that that they can tailor their remarks.

SPARK is a peer-led advocacy and support group for lone parents.  We offer unique insights into the lived reality of parenting alone in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Parenting alone is extremely challenging and while co-parenting with a non-cohabiting second parent is preferable, this is not always possible, especially in cases where abuse has been historically present.  Many parents are able to agree to access, custody and child maintenance without recourse to the courts and in other cases, parents may agree terms through mediation and will then enforce this through a legally binding court order.  The problem, however, is where parents cannot agree on these issues and need to go to court where a judge decides the matters.  The fact that parents are not able to agree to these fundamental issues without recourse to the court system can in itself indicate that there may be ongoing conflict, and non-compliance of court orders is likely.<\/p> <p>  The courts issue orders on the basis of compliance and once the order is issued, to a large extent, it is expected that the matter is complete.  However, many of our members experience post-separation abuse through the non-compliance of court orders involving maintenance and access.  Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, recognises non-payment of child maintenance as financial abuse.  Yet, as we rely on courts that predicate their position on compliance being the norm, many  lone parents will continue to experience ongoing conflict and, in the end, may forfeit maintenance rather than continuing through a court system that for many feels ineffective.<\/p> <p>  In our most recent research from April 2022, 36% of respondents claimed they were owed an average of &euro;8,300 in maintenance arrears but had given up pursuing it and were no longer using the courts to enforce maintenance orders.  Many parents report that a parent will fail to turn up for enforcement hearings and a court can do nothing until a bench warrant is executed.  That is very problematic as there is no prosecuting guard.  Other options such as attachment of earnings can be circumvented by the debtor changing employers.<\/p> <p>  Access is also an issue for many parents.  This can be both where access to the child is denied or where a child is prepared for an access visit and is left waiting when a parent fails to turn up.  For too many parents, access and maintenance are linked.  The biggest loser in this scenario is a child, who may have a damaged relationship with a non-custodial parent.  We believe that maintenance and access should be seen as two separate issues.  This could be achieved by a statutory maintenance agency that deals effectively with finance and which should take the conflict of payments from a family and allow children to have healthy relationships with both parents, if appropriate.  Family law and non-compliance of court orders is a very complex issue to discuss in such a short time but I would be happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bayliss very much.

It is a constant source of conflict and difficulty for separated families.<\/p> <p>  We know much research has been done into one-parent families and the fact that they are multiply disadvantaged.  Not much research has been done on child maintenance, access or custody, however.  Some work has been done by us in One Family and by SPARK.  Looking at what we have done and at international research from other countries, we can see that a whole suite of common problems exist where the State does not become involved in the management of maintenance.  At a national level, we see child poverty rates going up.  We also see repeated and inappropriate use of courts, which all costs the State money and difficulty.<\/p> <p>  At a personal level, we very much see in our services the conflict this causes within families who are trying to share parenting or separate.  Of course, there is the hardship for the children who are not being appropriately supported by both of their parents.  We are also aware that because of the conflict, there can be links between the payment of maintenance and access or contact for children.  Although these issues should be considered separately, they are sometimes looked at together.  We are aware that there are many difficulties in the administration of maintenance by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, for example, where it can be multiply assessed as means.  Sometimes, even if it is not paid, it is assessed as means.  We note that during the lockdown, the Department changed its policy and started to believe parents who said they had sought maintenance.  We would like to see that continued; it was very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I will mention our recommendations.  We would like the Department of Justice to commission independent research looking internationally.  We have done some work on this.  It is extremely difficult to know, not just from looking at the published papers but also from speaking directly to parents and organisations, how the different systems impact them.  We have not yet found a completely perfect system.  That needs to then be looked at in an Irish context to see what can happen.  We would like the recommendations to train staff in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Courts Service, legal professionals and the Judiciary.  That recommendation was made in the Oireachtas committee report on lone parents as well as in the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, strategy.  We would like child poverty to be recognised, with maintenance as part of that, in the next iteration of the children and young people's framework, that is, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020.  Child maintenance should be treated as a non-taxed, non-means-tested payment as with child benefit.  Really, it needs to come out of the family law courts.  It should not be linked to other issues.  An independent agency should do two things.  It should assess what should be paid and ensure it is paid through enforcement.

Barnardos provides front-line services to children and their families who are affected by traumatic and challenging life situations including poverty, parental mental health difficulties, neglect, bereavement, addiction and parental separation.  We offer a range of early intervention and targeted services in our 45 service locations across the country, in family homes, schools, community centres and in communities themselves.<\/p> <p>  In terms of parental separation, a recent analysis by Barnardos of families accessing our services showed that one third of children who currently access our services are involved in parental separation.  More and more families being referred to our services to help children and their parents deal with issues relating to parental separation.  These are the situations that get referred to us for entrenched conflict.  Sometimes, the relationships have become very difficult and sometimes toxic.  As a result, one or both of the parents cannot deal with the separation in an amicable way that is most beneficial to any children involved.  The court experience for families in which parents are separating can be very complex and confusing for all the parties, particularly for the children.  The whole process of going to court - the language used, the timing, the formality of seeing solicitors and judges - can be very unclear to the eyes of children.  The lack of certainty and clarity about timelines and potential outcomes can make things appear very complex.  One of the most complex elements of the court system around court orders and decisions needs to be about ensuring the best interests of the child.  Unfortunately, orders can be particularly ineffective if they get the balance wrong between balancing the rights of the parents and the best interests of the children.<\/p> <p>  Children understand that they are not the sole determining factor in court cases regarding access and custody.  Sufficient mechanisms must be in place to ensure their voices and views are gathered, however, and that adequate attention and consideration is given in terms of the decisions but also the pace of implementation and supports to implement those decisions.<\/p><p> There is a lack of professional support for parents and children after separation and family transition, particularly in terms of accessing custody.  More resources should be directed towards earlier supports for parents and children to deal with separation, raise awareness of the potential impact of acrimony on children and ensure strategies for parents to ensure a positive focus on children.  This might reduce the number of families who use the courts as a way of managing family conflict.<\/p><p> Many of the families and children we support who are living in separated households rely on maintenance payments to meet essential costs.  If maintenance goes unpaid, it can drastically affect their budgets and jeopardise their ability to afford essentials.  Many parents we work with cannot and do not seek maintenance from their previous partners, typically as a result of difficulties in those relationships, wider acrimony between both families and sometimes in the community, a history of previous partners not paying and a belief that maintenance will not be paid.  Sometimes it could be a threat to their own recovery and sobriety.  Therefore, we think the system is not working for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Stephanie Whyte","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates from Barnardos.

Our national information service deals with thousands of queries each year from parents, many of which queries are about maintenance.  Treoir provides legal information to those parents and their extended families and professionals through its services and by way of nationwide outreach.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the examination of the maintenance-recovery procedures.  We make our submission to this committee in the context of the ongoing work on the reform of the family court system.  Each year, Treoir receives thousands of queries about child maintenance  from mothers, fathers and extended family members, and our submission is based on their experiences.  A majority of calls relate to the interaction of maintenance payments with the one-parent family payment and other benefits and highlight the interaction between social protection, maintenance and lone parents experiencing poverty.<\/p> <p>  Under current social welfare policy, the onus is on the custodial parent to pursue maintenance on behalf of the child.  Where an agreement of maintenance between both parents cannot be reached, payment of child maintenance must be sought through the courts.  This can be a daunting and even traumatic experience, especially when there is a history of harassment or domestic violence.  Pursuing maintenance through the courts is time-consuming and expensive.  One caller to our information line described a 20-year battle in the courts to secure maintenance and arrears from an ex-partner as financial abuse.<\/p> <p>  Even when a court order is granted, it is not a guarantee that maintenance will be paid.  However, once that court order for maintenance is made, the amount is counted as means regardless of whether the maintenance is paid.  Consequently, non-payment of maintenance can result in families living on an income lower than their social welfare entitlement.  Lone-parent families already experience higher rates of deprivation than two-parent households, so the insecurity of income through the non-payment of child maintenance leaves them particularly vulnerable to poverty and deprivation.  In the context of the persistence of child poverty in lone-parent families, Treoir believes certainty in the recovery of child maintenance through a statutory agency will go some way towards alleviating child poverty by providing the income security that lone-parent families need.<\/p> <p>  Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child lays out that the state is required to take appropriate measures to secure the recovery of maintenance for the child from parents or other persons having financial responsibility for the child, both within the state party and from abroad.<\/p> <p>  Parenting alone brings many challenges.  Obtaining court orders for maintenance from the non-custodial parent should not be one of them.  There needs to be a standardised, fair system of assessment and recovery of child maintenance.  Treoir feels the establishment of a State maintenance agency would have a key role in that assessment and recovery maintenance.  An immediate benefit would be a reduction in time-consuming and often futile child maintenance cases currently in the court system.  Most crucially, the often-arduous task of pursuing child maintenance can be taken out of the hands of the custodial parent, resulting in a higher rate of enforcement of child maintenance being paid in Ireland and, potentially, greater engagement by both parents in their children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1161,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Peelo.

He is also a member of the Law Society&rsquo;s family and child law committee and is very much aware of the current issues and concerns in this area.<\/p> <p>  The Law Society&rsquo;s submission to the joint committee made the following five recommendations in response to questions raised - increase the use of the award-of-costs provision to alleviate the financial burden on lone parents when seeking payment of maintenance owed, and act as a penalty for the respondent party; maximise the reliefs available under the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015 where there have been consistent breaches of access orders; introduce guidelines to assist in determining appropriate maintenance contributions; establish set penalties for breaching court orders relating to child maintenance, access and custody; and, perhaps most significant, support the establishment of a State child maintenance agency to assist in matters relating to child maintenance. <\/p> <p>  We have provided detail of how those recommendations were arrived at.  We will be very glad to discuss this further today if helpful.  We also provided the committee with our 2021 submission to the Child Maintenance Review Group.  This highlighted the importance of maintenance for the support and well-being of the child from both financial and social policy perspectives.  We also welcomed the proposed establishment of a State maintenance agency, similar to the UK&rsquo;s Child Maintenance Service, and detailed the various services and supports that might be provided through such a vehicle.  These include providing guidance on the calculation of appropriate levels of maintenance; assisting parents in reaching agreed maintenance arrangements; assisting in &ndash; or, where appropriate, bringing &ndash; court applications to determine maintenance when it is in dispute; acting as the collecting agent for maintenance payments in appropriate cases; and engaging in the enforcement of maintenance and the collection of arrears, either directly or in concert with other State agencies. <\/p> <p>  We believe the cumulative effect of centralising these supports through one agency would be to minimise acrimony between the parties, to the ultimate benefit of the child or children involved. <\/p> <p>  The submission also compared enforcement provisions across various jurisdictions that may assist the committee in its work.<\/p> <p>  We believe these measures, together with progress on the family court Bill, which we appreciate has been listed as priority legislation for publication this autumn session, have the potential to greatly improve users&rsquo; current experience of the family law infrastructure in the State.

I wholeheartedly agree with them that the system we have does not work.  In some scenarios, it can adversely affect relationships with non-custodial parents if they are not paying maintenance.

It puts the parent who has ultimate responsibility in a very precarious position.<\/p> <p>  I have a question to which all of the delegates may respond.  The court system can take months or years to go through and can involve an endless, futile journey for parents.  Are there models abroad with timeframes that work?  Can we talk about the solution these would provide by comparison with our system, which imposes a huge financial burden on parents pursuing a challenge?

There are a number of comparative models.  I am suggesting to the committee, on behalf of the society, that the best way of approaching this is to embed a child maintenance agency within the existing structure in order that there be no legal vulnerabilities.  We could have a child maintenance agency established under statute and with orders ultimately appealable to the District Court, which would mean a lot of routine applications could be dealt with by the agency.<\/p> <p>  In our submission, we looked at a number of models.  There are two models to consider currently if a child maintenance agency is to be established, namely, the models from the UK and the Netherlands, both of which have such an agency in place.  In terms of speed, we know from the experience in other jurisdictions that a child maintenance agency is very effective in dealing with applications on a consensual basis.  The real problem is with enforcement.  That is where we could look at investing in agency powers that do not trespass on the powers of the court.  There is a delicate balance to be found to ensure there is no trespassing on what ultimately are the powers of the court.  There has been some recent Supreme Court jurisprudence on what is and is not possible.  It is the view of the Law Society of Ireland that a child maintenance agency will improve the efficiencies within the system and result in more timely decisions.<\/p> <p>  However, there are other issues that perhaps need to be addressed and the question of what role a child maintenance agency would play in that regard.  We must remember that maintenance is a private law obligation.   In regard to State supports, there is a need to ensure the agency works very closely with the Department of Social Protection.  It is about establishing those relationships, establishing the powers of the agency and making sure those powers work alongside the powers available to the courts, with the majority of the decisions being taken by the agency, subject to an appeal to the District Court, which is ultimately where most of these decisions are taken.  I hope that is helpful to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":1166,"content":"<p>Under the Scandinavian model, the state pays the child and parent upfront and recoups the payment from the liable relative.  That is the gold standard because it ensures the child is not living in poverty and the parent who needs the money gets it.  There are other systems.  Senator Ruane has done a lot of work on a Bill to deal with child maintenance, including looking at the Inland Revenue model in New Zealand.  One of the reasons we recommended research is that things can look good but one must speak to the end user to find out the reality.  We know from speaking to people in Scotland and elsewhere in Britain that there are significant difficulties with their systems and parents in Britain have to pay to use them.  Where the parent of a child is not paying for that child, the other parent has to pay to use the system to recoup payment.  It is very difficult to get a perfect system and it requires a little research to get it right.  Ultimately, as Dr. Shannon said, it is about taking matters as much as possible out of court and away from conflict.  The focus should be on doing it for the child.  That is what is really important and we have missed it in Ireland until now.

Even when there is entrenched conflict, parents should be helped to understand the impact on their children and to ensure the children are separated from the conflict going on between their parents.  Sometimes, there is a context of very aggressive behaviour by one of the partners involved even below the threshold of domestic abuse.  Entrenched conflict can be very difficult and we know children feel a sense of responsibility for conflict between their parents.  They feel it is their fault that mom and dad cannot agree, mom has to chase dad for money and dad does not pay mom.  They blame themselves.  We must have a situation in which there are supports around whatever model is used that allow people to manage their relationships and put the children at the centre.

We try to work with parents to help them to understand the new situation in which they find themselves in terms of their relationship with their child, how they can engage with the child to help him or her to understand what is happening and how they can develop positive and constructive means of communication, agreement and negotiation with their ex-partner before they have to go into the formality of agreement.

I have always been of the mind that the courts are not the place for dealing with child maintenance.  It seems there is consensus on that.  It is not the right environment to determine child maintenance arrangements.  As we know, payments can be ordered by the judge of the day, who can choose a figure off the top of his or her head.  There are no guidelines set out.  Moreover, whatever figure the judge chooses is not necessarily paid.  Every time, it is up to the lone parent to go back to court, a bench warrant is issued and, often, there is no prosecuting garda in attendance.<\/p> <p>  At every point, the burden comes back on lone parents.  We really need to take it off their shoulders.  I firmly believe a child maintenance service can only be beneficial for lone-parent families and the children of those families.  The children need to be central in the process but they are not central at the moment, which is part of the problem.  As other speakers have noted, there is a real need in this to deal with poverty and lift children out of poverty.  There is evidence to show that when maintenance is paid, it plays a role in doing that.<\/p> <p>  We are waiting for the report of the child maintenance review group.  That group was established in 2020 and it is welcome.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, received its report at Easter time and she confirmed to me two weeks ago that she will bring it to the Government before the end of the year.  It is highly likely, therefore, that we will not see it until next year, which would be really disappointing.  I urge the committee to seek the publication of the report as soon as possible.  I have no doubt good work has been done in producing it and it would be great for the stakeholders to see it.  Let us have the engagement on it and move forward from there.<\/p> <p>  Whatever the outcome of the report, which I hope is to recommend that a child maintenance service be established, it will not happen overnight.  Will the witnesses indicate what can be done now that will make a difference?  One such action would be removing the inclusion of maintenance payments as household means for the purpose of assessing eligibility for social welfare payments and housing.  Ms Bayliss has raised the issue of housing a number of times.  Will she comment on the impact of child maintenance payments on rent assessments in particular?  Action on that issue could be taken straight away.  Such payments should not be seen as means but as income to assist in raising a child or children.  That is what they are for and how they should be treated.  In addition, we should remove the condition whereby parents must prove they have sought maintenance before being able to get the one-parent family or jobseeker's transitional payment.  Again, that should not be the case.  These are two measures that could be taken immediately and would make a difference.  Is there anything else that can be done?<\/p> <p>  Looking at existing models is important.  On three occasions, we have brought forward proposals based on the model that is in place in the North.  It is not perfect but I am not sure we will find a perfect model.  The job of work has to be to find an existing model, take the lessons from it and then build the best model we can.<\/p> <p>  There is a need for reform within the Department of Social Protection and its liable relatives unit.  That unit really is only there to recoup the State's costs arising from the one-parent family payment.  That is slightly disturbing because it is not what it should be about.  It should always be about the child and recouping costs to assist in rearing that child.<\/p> <p>  Whatever service is established, which I hope will be done, enforcement is absolutely key.<\/p><p>We need strong links to Revenue.  Where payment is not made, it needs to be able to be taken from welfare payments, wages or wherever other means necessary.  There is no point in having a service if we do not have adequate enforcement to ensure payment is made.  The problem at the moment is that in many cases it is not actually made.<\/p><p> In previous years we have not been able to get a figure for the cost of establishing a child maintenance service.  I gather because of the work done by the review group, a figure is now there.  We were given a figure for our alternative budget this year of &euro;2.3 million.  That is the initial establishment cost.  Obviously, after that, not everybody will need to use the service, so I do not see the cost being anywhere near as high in future.  Could anything else be done immediately while we wait for this child maintenance review group report and hopefully the establishment which, unfortunately, will take time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#D00600","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>Enforcement is key and that is what is lacking.  The courts operate on the basis that there is compliance and if there is not, it is up to the lone parent to pursue it.  There should be options which are not there at the moment.  For instance, for the attachment of earnings it is necessary to know who the employer is.  A way to circumvent that is to change jobs and then the lone parent is back at the end of it.  We know their PPS numbers.  Why can it not be an attachment to a PPS number instead of an attachment of earnings?  It would mean that wherever they go whether they are self-employed or whether they are changing jobs, the lone parent does not need to find out who the employer is or where have they gone if they change.  Even having to know the address for the summons is a real barrier.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that the Deputy has mentioned housing, which is a major issue for many lone parents, especially in the case of domestic abuse.  Lone parents may get a court order requiring the mortgage or the rent to be paid, which is a very progressive thing.  However, unfortunately the Department of Social protection will not see that as the mortgage payment; it sees it as a cash payment into the hands of people.  There is hypocrisy that the State would support a lone parent through rent supplement to leave the family home but will then assess the mortgage payment and bar her from taking social welfare payments to maintain herself and her children.<\/p> <p>  A housing disregard was introduced in 1997 to help parents in that situation.  That was introduced at &pound;75 in 1997.  That payment is now &euro;95.23.  It is not reflective of the current housing market and is driving lone parents in domestic abuse situations from the family home and into a private rental market which costs the State more money.  Somebody might be entitled to a HAP of &euro;2,000 and yet where there is a court order ordering the mortgage of &euro;600 or &euro;700 to be paid, the Department is coming in and assessing it.

That needs to be resolved.  It should become a non-means tested payment.  It should be included.  We are waiting on the family justice strategy and the family law courts Bill to be published.  We need to see this as supporting that work.  I am aware of judges going into courts with calculators.  Somebody could work on an assessment framework for what is appropriate to meet the child's need.

The discussion has already moved on to what needs to be in place instead of just looking to enforce the orders.  I have spent probably about four years drafting legislation because it is such a difficult area.  A good chunk of that time was spent building the assessment calculation tool and, obviously, maths is not my forte.  It took us a long time to build what goes into that.  What if maintenance is paid to other families?  There are many inputs in terms of the liable parent and the assessment of percentage of their income, outgoings, other liable children and stuff like that.<\/p> <p>  It is based on the New Zealand model with additions.  The Women's Caucus has agreed to take that on as its first piece of legislative work as a cross-party group which I hope will give it strength.  It is just getting it to the final stages.  We have it built into the Revenue and the Revenue already has all the powers the system may need, including powers to deduct.  We have also looked at elements of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, model.  The bits we are finishing now relate to GDPR and using people's data if they refuse to engage.  How does it stand with GDPR in terms of default assessments and using someone's data?  Obviously, Revenue has all the information we need from PPS numbers to income.<\/p> <p>  We have looked at people's assets.  It has been a thorough piece of work which has taken a long time.  I hope it gets support.  I am also conscious of wanting to have guaranteed payment which the New Zealand model does not give.  I have drafted the legislation so that it is a building block and is open to add on subsequent sections.  If we eventually get to the stage where the State is willing to do guaranteed payment and then recoup, this legislation is built in a way that it can be added into the system even if it is not there initially.  If this legislation goes forward, I am concerned that it still might not be enough.  When we drive something, we always wonder what will happen if it does not achieve what we need it to achieve.<\/p> <p>  If we follow that New Zealand model within the Revenue it will not be a stand-alone agency, but I do not think it needs to be.

I think an incremental approach is the correct one.  There are challenges, one of which is that maintenance is a private law obligation.  That is unique to Ireland.  We have a unique maintenance system.  What we are talking about this afternoon is when parents are not in a position to support their children when they interact with the social welfare system, so we are looking at a point in time.  There are a number of models.  What the Senator suggests is, I think, the correct approach.  Incremental reform, I have always argued, is the best type of reform because reform has to be culturally appropriate.  We should not lose sight of that.  There are probably four models that could be followed.  Maintenance is guaranteed by the state in, for example, Australia, Sweden, Estonia, Italy, Germany and Hungary.  It is guaranteed by specific bodies indirectly governed by the state in France, Slovakia and Belgium.  It is governed by local authorities in the Czech Republic, Denmark and Finland.  It is guaranteed by special funds in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal.  It is guaranteed by special agencies in the UK and the Netherlands.  Whatever approach we take, we should not lose sight of the fact that children within the Irish system are generally invisible.  We are just ten years short of having passed the children's rights referendum.  It is a real tragedy that we treat children as what I would call bystanders, whereas they are deeply affected by the parents' inability to pay maintenance.  We need, therefore, to redouble our efforts to ensure there is a minimum.  Whatever the minimum payment is, it should be left as a minimum payment, and any deduction because of a maintenance payment that might be defaulted on should not occur if we are really serious about avoiding child poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>The point about the civil law aspect of this is interesting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#F00500","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1184,"content":"<p>Most of my questions have probably already been asked and answered.

Otherwise, the order states, \"You can pay the parent and we will take half of it.\"  Why on earth do we give parents the option to penalise their children?  Why are we giving parents that patriarchal approach that a man or a woman - whoever the liable relative is - can decide?  Why are we giving them the option to decide they do not want their children to see the benefit?  The parents themselves are not benefiting from that - they still have to pay the determination order - but we are letting them say to the Department, \"You can take all the money and make sure my child does not see it.\"  That is repugnant and it says something about how we treat children.

I have sat on the advisory council for that for the past six or seven years and the council has been very clear that our main focus is child poverty and that we would like a national child poverty action plan to be developed that is cross-departmental.  There are other countries, such as New Zealand and Scotland, that do that very well and have it based in legislation.  Every Department centres the needs of children so this does not become a value judgment about the parents.  Research tells us that people make judgments about different kinds of parents for different reasons.  We need to circumvent that at a State level.<\/p> <p>  There is another opportunity.  Cosc defines the non-payment of child maintenance as financial abuse, but that is not reflected anywhere in legislation, services from the Department of Social Protection or anywhere else.

I hear clearly what was said about a public model that does not depend on maintenance being paid.  We have discussed before the difficulty with enforcement.  The witnesses' baseline is that they would like an ideal scenario in which money is transferred by whatever means.  I accept what has been said about the philosophical point, which I had not really thought about until it was phrased in that way.  It is interesting because we talk about child poverty but we fail sometimes to connect the language of failing to pay maintenance.  I think more people would connect with that language if it were more broadly situated.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon and Ms Bayliss might respond to the following.  Let us say a parent wants to pay maintenance and is reliably paid.  That is not the baseline.  We have a public model which is the baseline, and maintenance can be paid on top of that.<\/p><p>However, our concern is situations where it is not paid and how we can attach that.  What was said about the PPS number is very important.  It is important that the liable parent, as it were, pays and it is not just the State.  It should not become an acceptable State idea that people can leave their child &ndash; or whatever scenario has happened before &ndash; and have no financial obligation to care for their child in some way.  I do not want to decouple it so much that maintenance ceases to be relevant to it.  There are many different ways of considering that, whether that is paid from a court order that is simply then paid to or attached to Revenue and feeds into the Exchequer fund generally and goes to support a different model.<\/p><p> I am interested in what Dr. Shannon said about how far an agency can go.  I do not know if he elaborated on that following the Supreme Court and how far an agency can go beyond a court being involved.  The biggest difficulty seems to be with access to court and actual enforcement of the different models.  We have talked much about maintenance, but enforcement of access is an issue I see again and again in different ways.  With an access issue, one should not have to go back to court each time.  It makes the issue much bigger than it needs to be when one is trying to have a harmonious life for a child.

There is a real challenge in not overstepping the parameters.  There is being ambitious on the one hand and there is making sure we calibrate the balance in the correct manner on the other.  How do we do this?  We can be much more creative in the sanctions that we introduce for failure to pay maintenance.  I absolutely agree with all of the members of the panel that the failure to pay maintenance is a red flag in terms of child protection.  If people are not maintaining their child, it raises fundamental questions.

We have used that for access and traditionally for maintenance.  However, there could be a power to pursue somebody who failed to pay maintenance retrospectively.  That is curtailed at the moment to a very short number of months.  However, we could remove that and target the defaulting parent&rsquo;s assets.  Do not look at it in terms of a criminal sanction.

The best way to deal with this is alternative dispute resolution.  The Government should try to have an elaborate system for engaging with parents at an early stage and create that in a more sophisticated manner than currently exists.  There is huge potential in that.  If we look at some of the other international models where that has occurred, it has occurred with a degree of success.  That is the real potential.  However, let us not pretend that there is a magic bullet; there is no magic bullet here.  The Government needs to look at the powers it can grant to the agency and support the agency in terms of resources but also in terms of alternative dispute resolution and try to get as much agreement as it possibly can.

The goal is for that relationship to be meaningful and for parents to see their actions as parenting choices.  What can we do now?

That point around what happens to those who are at the margins resonated with me.<\/p> <p>  The cases we are talking about this afternoon are those parents &ndash; and children affected by the decisions of parents &ndash; who access our District Court, which is a very local court, on a daily basis.  How do we help them out?  The child maintenance agency would be a game-changer, but it needs to supplemented by other systems, as the point raised by Deputy Carroll MacNeill.<\/p><p>The other systems would be that idea of the maintenance fund and then additional sanctions.  What we need to do is provide for all contingencies, and the additional sanctions would be sanctions that do not involve criminalising a parent.  Sending a parent to prison is counterproductive.  It is about how we provide more effective provisions.<\/p><p> I will finish with a case in point.  We have not talked a lot of about access and the breach of access orders, which is a very serious problem.  In the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, there were new and innovative sanctions for dealing with those who refused to facilitate access.  Anecdotally, it would appear that those sanctions are not being utilised so we need to use the legislation that we have currently in place.  The society is currently undertaking research across all of the District Court areas to look at how that Act is operating, and we are quite happy to feed that research into the committee.  What we are hearing anecdotally is that the provisions that were created to ensure access is not breached are not being used to the maximum, and that needs to happen.  I hope that has been helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#G02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1216,"content":"<p>Are solicitors looking for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#H00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":1217,"content":"<p>My view is that there is an education issue, not just for solicitors but across the Judiciary as well.

This is a significant topic.  There are people who do not take up access and there are parents who do not facilitate it.  We are aware, through our services and through working with mums and dads and separated families, that there are often high levels of fear and concern about the child.  This is exacerbated through conflicts in the family courts and the inability of courts to have accurate information in the form of assessments in a timely, affordable or accessible way.  That is a whole other issue.<\/p> <p>  It is very complicated.  We know there is a huge gap in practice and understanding of where child protection systems interact with private family law cases and criminal cases, and there can be all three going on in one family and affecting a child, and there is no satisfactory system or any system to bring those together.  That is a major issue that we are hoping will be addressed in the family justice strategy, or at least pointed to in that strategy.  The courts do not have all of the information they need because people are either representing themselves or they might be privately represented, and there can be inherent power imbalances, with people walking in while in coercive control situations.  There are many reasons why access may not or should not happen.  We also know of children being into unsafe or inappropriate contact by means of court orders because, for whatever reason, the courts may not have all of the information available to them.  There are massive problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":1222,"content":"<p>I would like to add a few thoughts about access and sanctions.  I do not think sanctions are working.  There needs to be better enforcement than having to go in and out of court.  I say that as somebody who has been in and out of court, and it is draining, destroying and really upsetting emotionally.  The idea of attaching it to a PPS number and going through Revenue is a simple solution.  If we look at the property tax, for instance, Revenue has the right to go directly to your employers, they have your PPS number and they will take whatever is owed.  If we can do that for a property tax, why can we not do it with child benefit or for the rights of a child?  Children have more need than property does.  That is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  With regard to access, no woman wants to deprive her child of access in a safe environment, although that is not to say it does not happen; it does.  From years of talking to women in SPARK who are going through this, if someone is in a powerless situation and they feel powerless going in and out of the courts, their only weapon - it should not be a weapon but that is what happens in an adversarial court system - is to withdraw access if he has not paid maintenance.  It is unfair and it is wrong on the children, but it does happen.  If we guarantee the payment to a child through Revenue, then we take all of that out and there is no reason for a woman to deny access.<\/p> <p>  All of the international research has shown that when a parent pays maintenance, they will keep in contact with the child.  Again, the Deputy said she does not think it should be totally decoupled.  The proof is that when they pay maintenance, they will see the child.  I am not advocating one way or the other for a statutory maintenance agency or for Revenue, but something needs to happen urgently because children are suffering in the meantime, and they are suffering because of access issues and poverty.  If we sort out the revenue coming into the family, a lot of the access issues will be sorted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1223,"content":"<p>Thank you.

This November, we are ten years on from the children's rights referendum where we talked about hearing children.  The people most affected by the refusal to facilitate access are actually children.  It is absolutely important that we ensure children are heard in these decisions because they are the people who ultimately will be affected.<\/p> <p>  There are problems within the system at the moment with regard to ensuring that happens.  We need the resourcing of reports if children are to be heard indirectly, but they are not adequately resourced.  The second point is that we still have not succeeded in that project of hearing children in all cases.  With regard to a new family court - we were just talking about this outside - two generations of children have grown up since we first started talking about this issue, yet children are not properly heard in these cases.  This is a fundamental issue.  In maintenance and access applications, it is of paramount importance that children are heard either directly or indirectly.

Again, it goes back to resources.  Definitely, a child's voice needs to be heard and their reasoning needs to be heard.<\/p> <p>  What we are interested in is not just that this is provided for by expertise, which is needed in these complex cases, but also that parents are given tacit support to be able to recognise what is in the best interests of the child.  We would have heard that from both parents in an adversarial role, with both thinking they are doing the same thing although it is complete opposite, and both claiming it is in the best interests of the child.

Children repeatedly tell us that for the most part they want to have a meaningful relationship with both parents.  Where it gets complicated is when there is not a sufficient support system around that to delve into the complexity of relationships.  These are very complex, hurtful scenarios that children are dealing with all the time and there seems to be no scope to cope with that nuance and complexity.  It is not static; it is dynamic.  Children's feelings change and evolve, depending on the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Children tell us over and over again, particularly if they have observed bad behaviour by one of their parents, that when they have been bold they get into trouble, of if they have done something bad they have to acknowledge it, say that they did it and say they are sorry.  When it comes to access, children sometimes say they would not mind having a relationship with their parent but it is contingent on that parent saying to the child that the parent is sorry that something happened, that the child did not imagine it, the parent did it, should not have done it and is sorry.  They can then move forward in their relationship.  There is, however, no support structure for those kind of conversations to be facilitated and teased out in a safe way that allows children to say these kinds of things to whichever parent it is and also for the parent to hear it, to be supported to hear it and genuinely allowed to be facilitated on a therapeutic journey, if he or she is willing and able to engage in that.<\/p> <p>  It is very complex.

Currently, we have voice-of-the-child reports that are done by child view experts for which there is a level of regulation and control.  There are difficulties with that.  There is no regulation whatsoever of section 47 child welfare reports.  There is nowhere for parents to go.  We have had parents report to us very serious concerns about their assessors and there is nothing they can do.  There is no professional body they can go to.  There is an interesting case in the UK at present on this and the qualifications of someone doing these reports.  There is a significant requirement on the State to regulate, at a minimum, people who can do them but ultimately, to pick up on what we said and what Barnardos staff are saying, a lot can be done outside of court for a much lower cost.  That is what we do, day in, day out, in One Family.  We can have people come to realisations and agreements and they do not have to go down the court route, or they get ratified in court.<\/p> <p>  Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork, UCC, are doing research for us at present on access for infants in separated families.  They are saying that their voices need to be heard.  We are not hearing the voices of children who are much older than that.  There is no system.  If someone cannot afford to pay, it is not happening.  We are not vindicating children's rights under the Constitution at present and that is very problematic.  Ultimately, each family and each child are different.  We need somebody skilled who is able to look at that situation and listen to everybody.  Children cannot hold the responsibility of picking whether they get to see a parent or not.  They can be consulted but they cannot make that decision unless they are much older.  There has to be a system around to do that.  We proposed a model in our submission to the family justice oversight group around a family law services model, which would complement what will be done in the courts.  It will not be as successful as it should be unless these things are done.<\/p> <p>  Assessments and the quality and timeliness of information that goes into court are key.  I definitely sense a reluctance on the part of the State to regulate, fund or support any kind of reporting on families.  Yet, that is what is ultimately needed for the success and closure of cases, which means happier families and less trauma.  Our systems are causing adverse childhood experiences.  The separation may not do so but the trauma and process families have to go through are causing adverse childhood experiences, which people like us and Tusla need to look at and count to see how traumatised a child is.  The State is complicit in creating these situations, unfortunately.  There is so much that can be done.  If child maintenance could be removed from the family law arena, there would be more resources to do that bit of it properly.  Only what has to go to court should do so.  Some 80% or 90% of this should be done outside of court.  That is across all family law issues, not just maintenance but access, custody, guardianship, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":1231,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a very important point.

In these cases, the courts upheld that the Travellers' way of living was such that it was not appropriate for a child to visit them.  That is not based on evidence, and it is not even based on a section 47 report; it is based on somebody's perception of what it is to be a Traveller and what living in a halting site or Traveller-specific scheme would entail.

We made a point earlier that the entire court system is alien, formal, intimidating, scary and confusing.  If you add in a layer of coercive control, vulnerable groups' feelings of fear and lack of self-esteem play out and the children's right to access to both parents gets lost.

There is an opportunity for the committee in the context of the imminent arrival of the family court Bill to ensure diversity is front and centre.  What the Senator articulated completely resonated with me because I have been involved in several State reviews in which these issues have arisen.  It is really powerful to hear them articulated in the manner in which they were articulated by the Senator.  We must make sure the issues are very visible in the family court Bill.  The Law Society will be agitating for this because its view is that while we need a diverse Judiciary, we also need a court system that is responsive to diversity and inclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#K01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Shannon.  I am going to put a question or two myself because we have been around the table a couple of times and most members have had their say.  I wish to raise a point alluded to in the opening statements and featured throughout the discussion.  With regard to diversity and the need for the courts to be responsive, do many of these issues arise owing to slow progression through the court system?  A matter may be listed but not taken or adjourned because of the prospect of talks or progress.  Developments are always on the never-never or always in the ether but never seem to happen very often.  Progress can take months, if not years, and all the while those concerned are on the receiving end waiting for an order or award to be made while trying to make ends meet.  I would imagine this is a huge issue.  Do the answers entail more efficient progression through the system and less tolerance of no-shows or adjournments on a whim?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#K01600","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666652400,"counter":1251,"content":"<p>That is a relevant point.  We have not discussed the fact that the non-enforcement of court orders facilitates post-separation abuse.  In a case of domestic abuse, the only area remaining where someone can exercise coercive control is around access and maintenance.  That is used post separation.  The courts are really at the mercy of people's behaviour because they assume compliance and if there is none, it is up to the other person to repeatedly go back to the court.  What the Chairman said about adjournment is true to a point.  It is even more dangerous than that, in one sense.  As was mentioned earlier, if a person does not turn up for a court appointment, which often happens, the judge will sometimes lose patience, allow no more adjournments and issue a bench warrant.  There is no prosecuting garda in family law cases.  The bench warrant goes out to the local Garda station and sits in a tray waiting to be executed and because there is no prosecuting garda, it is unlikely to be executed unless a parent can go directly to a superintendent and get it enforced.  All proceedings are halted.  The court's arms are tied until that bench warrant is executed.  That is an horrendous and ongoing situation.  Our research revealed that 36% of parents are owed a significant amount of arrears and have stopped seeking it either voluntarily, because of the ongoing and draining nature of the process to which the Chairman referred, or because a bench warrant is sitting in a Garda station waiting to be executed.  That ends the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022102500002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1252,"content":"<p>I noted that in her opening statement, Ms Bayliss made reference to the lack of a prosecuting garda.

That is good.  There are significant delays and challenges.  If the family court Bill delivers what has been signalled it will, specialist judges will be enrolled and they will be supported.  That should mean fewer delays.  We in One Family are aware from our work of cases where reports done for children have gone out of date because it has taken so long to get assessment and a court date, and then they have had to go again.  Those parents are paying significant amounts of money, &euro;7,000 or more, for those reports.  The courts own them rather than the parents.  There is a lot of waste.  There is not a system really, to be quite honest, so we need to build a system.  Even in respect of child maintenance, there is no system.  The Chairman's question is pertinent and relevant to the lived reality of many thousands of families in Ireland.  There are numerous answers and not only one.

The issue is that the partner of that person knew how to play and utilise the system.  The many others who do not know how to do that are caught in the position to which Ms Bayliss referred whereby people do not turn up and bench warrants issue.  Where the ultimate sanction is one of imprisonment, it is often the case that a mother will not choose that and will ask for it not to be enforced.  Parents sometimes do not agree on an amount of maintenance and that is why we are saying an agency to deal with those issues is required.  That way, those parents should not have to go to court because there is a statutory obligation to pay maintenance that we know is there.  It should include a fixed minimum fee.  There may be issues around one's personal public service, PPS, number and Revenue involvement.  However, whatever way the agency may use that information, it is important that maintenance is immediately deducted so there are no long-term delays and people do not have to go through a court process.  The person still maintains a right to bring matters to a court and have them judicially reviewed and appealed but that should not come at the cost of not paying the maintenance.  The maintenance should start at the beginning of that process rather than leaving people waiting.  We need to set a minimum statutory amount for situations in which parents do not agree and for that to be immediately enforced.

There are three aspects to this matter.  The court buildings are only one third of the issue.  The infrastructure is a key consideration.

I would prefer we did not establish a family court system unless it is properly supported.  The success of the family court system will be dependent on the support systems that are put in place.  Those systems include counselling and mediation services, those wraparound services.  The third, and equally important, point is to explain why we are having these delays.  We need fundamental procedural reform to address how cases are dealt with.  There needs to be a root-and-branch review of the procedural issues at both District Court and Circuit Court levels.<\/p><p>I have a huge amount of sympathy for District Court judges who are dealing with a large number of cases.  It must be remembered that in a child and care context, the most important decision one will ever take in a case is to decide whether to take a child into care.

It is important to our economy in promising to deliver on a modern regulatory system for a crucial business sector.  It is important for our society in providing safety and security for people as they seek to benefit from the considerable opportunities provided by the Internet.  It is most important, however, for our children.  We can all acknowledge how important it is to be able to protect our children from online harm and empower them to deal with the challenges of an online society.  I propose a range of amendments in three categories.  The first is on foot of issues raised in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and on which I committed to act.  The second is amendments to provide for the individual complaints mechanism and the third is amendments required for technical reasons.  The Government approved the amendments on 18 October.<\/p> <p>  The expert group report on the individual complaints mechanism was published on 20 September.  The group ultimately concluded that the complaints mechanism was feasible and, on foot of that, the appropriate amendments have been drafted.  The amendments ensure that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n has a legal basis to begin phasing in a robust individual complaints mechanism in the coming years which will initially focus on children and a number of non-offence-specific categories of harmful online content such as cyberbullying.<\/p> <p>  Another amendment is designed to provide for the inclusion of further forms of offence-specific harmful online content under Schedule 3 of the Bill.  This further content relates to the criminal offence of flashing under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  The amendments will allow the online safety commissioner to appropriately deal with online content related to the offence of flashing through systemic regulations.  Other important changes are amendments to ensure the inclusion of local broadcasters in the scheme to support professional journalistic practices and to provide clarity on when coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may dismiss certain complaints.<\/p> <p>  I know that members of the committee have proposed a range of amendments on a range of issues and I look forward to the debate.  I intend to bring a number of amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  The first group of amendments will be to section 53, specifically those provisions that relate to the content production scheme.  I am conscious that Deputies have proposed their own Committee Stage amendments to section 53, some of which relate to matters that I have been considering for some time.  I look forward to discussing them in detail with Deputies and indicating how I will seek to address those issues on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I intend to bring an amendment to provide that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services and promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services.<\/p> <p>  I intend to bring a number of technical amendments to remove references to the obligation of RT&Eacute; and TG4 to maintain the teletext service.  There is a sense of urgency to this debate, not least in the form of infringement proceedings pending at EU level, because we are very motivated to formally establish coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and empower and resource it to start its important work.

It is the same for amendment No. 5, which would use \"coimisin&eacute;ir\" instead of \"commissioner\".  It might seem a moot point but there is a logic to this, given the change the Minister has accepted but also the changes that will come into effect at some stage.  Maybe the Minister can clarify when alt 9D d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la is going to come into being.  There are a lot of new State companies being created and according to that Act, which was passed by the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President, all future State companies should be known in the Irish language.  That is some of the logic behind these two amendments.  That references section 9D of the amended Official Languages Act, which I believed at the time indicated there would be a different approach to the titles of organisations.  That has happened in this instance but, logically, the first language should also be used when referring to it in law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#A00800","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1284,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; &Oacute; Snodaigh, Munster agus Mythen as a gcuid leasuithe.

When I established the expert group earlier this year I made it clear that if it was feasible to introduce an individual complaints mechanism, I would provide for it in the Bill.  That is what I am proposing to do with these amendments.  The expert group has done its work and has given detailed consideration to the wide range of issues raised in the context of an individual complaints mechanism, including through a public consultation and engagement with experts such as the Australian e-safety commissioner.  The expert group&rsquo;s report and recommendations chart a practical way forward for the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism, focused on operationalising the mechanism on a phased basis and firstly for children.  These amendments were drafted on the basis of the heads contained in the expert group&rsquo;s report and they hew closely to the expert group&rsquo;s recommendations, save for necessary legal adjustments by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p><p>In this regard, amendment No. 118 provides for the substantive provisions for the phasing in and operation of an individual complaints mechanism, including how an coimisi&uacute;n can make schemes for complaints about various kinds of harmful online content; the threshold that must be met before an coimisi&uacute;n will handle a complaint; the kinds of resolutions for complaints available to an coimisi&uacute;n; a requirement for an coimisi&uacute;n to set out a plan for operationalising these provisions; and a requirement for an coimisi&uacute;n to prioritise operationalising the individual complaints mechanism for children in the first instance.<\/p><p>The remainder of the amendments in this grouping - amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, 43, 82, 108, 118 to 120, inclusive, 124 to 128, inclusive, 130 to 136, inclusive, 146, 148 to 256, inclusive, 258 to 264, inclusive, 266 to 269, inclusive, 272 to 292, inclusive, 317 and 318 - are consequential to amendment No. 118 and relate to the necessary renumbering of sections throughout the Bill to account for the insertion of amendment No. 118.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B00900","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1292,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten looks worried that we will be here all night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01000","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1293,"content":"<p>I nearly had a full house there with all those numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1294,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1295,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, line 34, to delete &ldquo;section 139ZZ(2)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 139ZZH(2)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1296,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1297,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, line 36, to delete &ldquo;section 139ZZ(3)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 139ZZH(3)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01500","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1298,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 6, to delete &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Coimisin&eacute;ir&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01700","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1301,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 9, 10, 137 and 265 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01900","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6: <\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 30, to delete &ldquo;definition&rdquo; where it firstly occurs and substitute &ldquo;definitions&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>These are purely technical amendments inserting a definition of the e-commerce directive into section 2 of the 2009 Act, which concerns definitions.

The aim of these amendments is to try to ensure a wide range of duties and responsibilities, go bhfuil dualgas dearfach agus reacht&uacute;il ann &oacute; thaobh chur chun cinn na Gaeilge i measc na me&aacute;n.

Its history, traditions, language and music need to be presented and supported.  There is a duty to promote beyond what is sometimes the current view that is a burden.  If the duty to promote the Irish language and our traditions is included in legislation, then we can demand of the media that they do more.  For many years, the debate has been focused on the failure of our State broadcaster to fully carry out its duty under the Constitution to promote the Irish language and do more to ensure that our traditions are promoted.  We believe this is an opportunity to right that wrong and to ensure that all the media in Ireland understand that is part of their duty.<\/p><p>A number of the amendments relate to section 7 and further down they relate to the long Title of the Bill because we believe it of such important that it should be mentioned.  The issue was raised on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Having reflected further on that debate in the Seanad, the Minister may now be in a better position to accept these amendments or at least give an indication to come back on Report Stage with a version of what is being proposed here.<\/p><p>Maidir le leas&uacute; Uimh. 5, sin an fhocla&iacute;ocht a chur Conradh na Gaeilge chun cinn.

I consider that the intention of the amendments is already provided for in the specific references to the role of an coimisi&uacute;n in paragraphs (<i>c<\/i>) and (<i>e<\/i>) of subsection (3) of section 7 of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by section 7 of the Bill.

I have secured increased allocations to TG4 over the past three budgets.  When I took up the post as Minister, the Exchequer allocation for TG4 was &euro;37.2 million.  In 2023, that allocation will be &euro;52.2 million, which is an increase of just over 40% over a three-year period.  I also approved TG4's proposal to establish a new dedicated Irish language children's channel, C&uacute;la4, and made a specific &euro;3.3 million provision in budget 2023 to support the new channel.<\/p><p>The language in the Bill is sufficient to ensure support by an coimisi&uacute;n for the production of programming in the Irish language with regard to climate action.  Replacing the term &quot;promote and stimulate&quot; with &quot;ensure and increase&quot; would imply that an coimisi&uacute;n, as a media regulator, could direct the editorial content of a broadcaster or video-on-demand service towards a particular outcome.  As an coimisi&uacute;n will not have that power, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p><p>Aonta&iacute;m le cusp&oacute;ir leas&uacute; Uimh. 21.

Ar Ch&eacute;im na Tuarasc&aacute;la sa Seanad thug m&eacute; ar aghaidh leas&uacute; ar an Bhille ina bhfor&aacute;iltear in alt 7(3)(c) den Acht Craolach&aacute;in 2009, a dtagann an Bille ina &aacute;it, go nd&eacute;anfaidh an coimisi&uacute;n &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a spreagadh sna me&aacute;in cumars&aacute;ide a fheidhm&iacute;tear sa St&aacute;t.  This is a broader duty than proposed by the Deputies given that it encompasses the print media in addition to broadcasters, video-on-demand services and online services.  I, therefore, do not accept amendment No. 21.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I leas&uacute; Uimh. 20, d&rsquo;fhor&aacute;lfa&iacute; go bhf&eacute;adfadh an coimisi&uacute;n athbhreithnithe strait&eacute;iseacha a dh&eacute;anamh ar na hearn&aacute;lacha a riala&iacute;onn an coimisi&uacute;n maidir le craolach&aacute;n i nGaeilge.  The committee will be aware that the Report of the Future of Media Commission recommends that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n should conduct a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system, with a focus on institutional structures and opportunities for innovation and collaboration as well as strategies for youth engagement and Irish language education.  Amendment No. 20 would confine the strategic review to broadcasting in the Irish language whereas the comprehensive review to be undertaken by an coimisi&uacute;n will be broader in scope and include digital media.

However, we are taking action to increase the quantity of Irish language advertising.  As the committee will be aware, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, recently brought the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 through the Oireachtas.  As a consequence, section 10A of the Official Languages Act, as amended, will, when commenced, require public bodies to spend at least 20% of their advertising budgets on Irish language advertisements, with at least 5% to be placed through Irish language media.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 320 would amend the Long Title of the Bill to reference specifically the role of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n regarding the use and visibility of the Irish language.  The Long Title of the Bill is not intended to capture or reference comprehensively every duty of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n nor to reference one in particular.  Rather, it is intended to set out the broad contents of the Bill.

Therefore, if we put any provisions and additions on top of the duties and responsibilities of commercial media they get on with it.  They understand that is a duty to allow them to continue to broadcast and operate in the State.  It should not be seen as a duty but in some ways as just one of those issues they must comply with.  In this case it is a positive duty they would have to ensure the promotion of the Irish language and our traditions.  If we were to leave this on the exact same footing as all other languages in the country there is a danger the Irish language and its traditions will remain as an afterthought for many of the media.  I welcome the changes that have happened in recent years.  I am not blind to them.  I welcome the huge investment in TG4 and the fact we will have a children's TG4 soon enough.  There is a lot more to do about the damage done as a result of the Irish language being ignored by our national media for so many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#D00400","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1340,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1341,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 16:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 19, line 16, after &ldquo;traditions,&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo;in particular, the duty not only to satisfy existing demand but to stimulate increased demand for Irish language programming and content, in line with the national aim of restoring the Irish language as a spoken language nationwide,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#E00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1342,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy wish to speak to the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#E00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1343,"content":"<p>I have just spoken to it because they were grouped.

However, it is important that we retain flexibility in this regard to ensure the widest array of candidates are available on establishment of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.

As the officials will know, this is an issue that was discussed at length a number of years ago.  The intention was to reduce the levy to the independent broadcasters, in recognition of the public service remit they are providing through the radio stations.  The rules in Standing Orders mean it is not possible for me to table such an amendment here as it would be ruled out of order by the Chair, so I have used this mechanism to raise this issue with the Minister in the hope she can indicate that she is prepared to look again at the broadcasting levy.<\/p><p>One of the big problems with the broadcasting levy as it is structured is that it is regressive and disproportionate, particularly for smaller radio stations.  They are the ones that are struggling to remain viable and yet they are the most important aspect of the broadcasting network at local level throughout the country.  We have taken the decision, and rightly so, to waive the fees for community radio stations.  We are unique globally in having a thriving community radio station network.  It is a positive development that we are waiving those fees.  With the way the levy is calculated currently, all broadcasters, regardless of size or turnover, pay the same percentage on the first tranche of money.  Following that, the more money a broadcaster makes, the less of a percentage they pay on those higher amounts.  It disproportionately penalises the smaller stations.  The intention behind this is to give recognition to the public information role provided by radio stations.<\/p><p>This came to the fore during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  Storm Ophelia was the high winds of 2017, which led to a tragic loss of life.  A huge amount of our electricity network throughout the country was disrupted, and that had a knock-on impact on broadband and mobile phone coverage.  The only way the State could get vital public information out to communities throughout this country was through local radio stations and the local radio network.  The same happened with Storm Emma, or the beast from the east as it was called, in spring 2018.  A huge amount of our existing infrastructure was brought down, and we are becoming more reliant on broadband and electricity.  One is co-dependent on the other.  If electricity goes, our broadband and mobile networks go, and as a result of that the only mechanism to get a message across to the public is through our local radio stations.<\/p><p>When we do the be winter-ready campaign, one of the elements in relation to that should be to actively encourage people to have an old radio and a set of batteries so that they can tune in to the local radio station and get updates on the return of electricity, on water supplies, emergency services and where services can be availed of, because it is only on a local radio station that such a level of information can be given out.  During those two especially severe weather events, we were all so dependent on our local radio stations to give us vital information.  RT&Eacute; and the national broadcasters were great, but they were not going to be able to tell a rural townland in County Roscommon or County Galway when their electricity was likely to be back.  They could not go into that level of detail.  However, the local radio station could and did give it.  That must be recognised.  There should be recognition in terms of a reduction in the broadcasting levy.  That was before we saw the financial impact of Covid-19 on many broadcasters.  Many of the smaller ones now are struggling at this stage.  They are the ones that are so vital across many rural areas.  Could the Minister look at the proposals and commitments that have been given previously for a reduction in the broadcasting levy, and provide us with clarity and an intention to come back on Report Stage to amend the legislation in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#G01100","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1387,"content":"<p>I support my colleague, Deputy Naughten, in what he said.

We are all aware of local radio stations in our area.  The listenership is of massive proportions.  People might listen to national radio for an hour or so, but inevitably they will always switch back to their local radio for news and, as other speakers have said, for information following storms.  Local radio can offer all of that vital information to local communities.

The levy should be reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#H00400","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1390,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who tabled the amendment and those who contributed on it.  As they said, the Bill already provides that community broadcasters will not be liable for the industry levy, so this is focused on commercial radio broadcasters.  I value the service being provided by local radio.  I grew up not too far from Deputy Munster and I relied on LMFM and Northern Sound.  I know the value of local radio in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The industry levy contained in section 21 of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, is based on the principle that each category of service pays for the cost of activities related to that service so that there is no cross-subsidisation of one sector by another.  This is an important general regulatory principle and one I do not think we should depart from.  However, it is important to note that the Bill already provides that up to 50% of the cost of regulating broadcasting can be met through the TV licence.  This was carried over from the Broadcasting Bill, which Deputy Naughten in particular progressed.  However, the Deputies will also be aware that a technical working has been established to look at reforms to the TV licence and we must let that group complete its work.  Members will also be aware of the additional funding I mentioned earlier that has been put in place for radio through the sound and vision fund.  These supports will also be available at an increased level through the media fund.  I am committed to radio and I believe these measures will help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#H00500","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1391,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comments in response to the amendment and her commitment to and recognition of local radio stations and the important role they play.  The difficulty I have here is that, as the Minister said, up to 50% of the cost of the levy can be met from the TV licence fee.  That is not to say it will be met from the TV licence fee.  As we all know well, the difficulty is that when the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get their claws into this, nothing will happen.  What we are seeking is greater clarity on the commitment that there is a determination, in particular for the smaller stations, that they would see a reduction in the levy and that there would be a recognition of the important public service role they play.  We have seen at first hand the importance of these stations during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  My fear is that with the commercial squeeze that is being put on many of the smaller radio stations the current disproportionate structure of the broadcasting levy would result in many of them going out of business.  We would see the amalgamation of stations take place that will not be able to give the information, for example, on what went on in Bridgetown, or when the electricity will be back in 50 townlands across a listenership area.  That is the type of detail that was provided during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  It is not possible for RT&Eacute; or regional radio stations to give that level of detail.  They can advise people to go on to their websites or Twitter accounts for a breakdown in that regard but the reality is that if the electricity to the local mobile phone mast is gone down, and the broadband cable is damaged, along with the electricity cable, people have no Internet.  Any online forum is of no use.  The only way to get a message to people across the board is through the local radio station.<\/p> <p>  We must make sure that those radio stations can survive.  That is why I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  I know her commitment and that of her officials in this regard but I ask her to reconsider this between now and Report Stage to see if we can provide a greater level of assurance and clarity regarding the reduction in the broadcasting levy and ensure that it is far more proportionate and recognises to a far greater extent the vital role played by these local broadcasters across the country in times of emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#H00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1392,"content":"<p>The important thing is we catch something in this legislation or some commitment is made rather than leaving it in abeyance, because if it drifts from this legislation and this opportunity, we could rue what we have done.  When the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gets its hands on it, it will be a different kettle of fish.  Even from a music industry point of view, it is very important we take into account the number of local people who get airtime on local stations, which helps their profile and helps develop arts and culture throughout the country at local level.  Many local artists get a platform at local radio station level.  It is important we continue to support that as well as all the other services they offer.

It is great to hear a Minister who is very much aware of the power and value of local radio.  While these stations are ultimately commercial ventures, they serve a particular public need.  They are not obliged to in the main but they feel they must.  Many of us in this room have cited those occasions on which local radio becomes vital in terms of communicating directly with local communities.  I hope that in how we look at how we structure and fund the provision of public service news gathering and dissemination in the future, and that is across print and broadcast, we strike that balance to ensure the public service remit of local radio is supported, as we have done recently with our print media.  I hope a similar gesture of support is extended to local broadcasters.  It is vital this happens.  They have that public service remit and within the broader spectrum of supporting public service news gathering and dissemination and in acknowledgement of the very difficult financial circumstances in which the vast majority find themselves haemorrhaging advertising revenue to social media platforms.  It is time to extend that hand of support as best we can in the context of an overall examination of how we fund public service journalism in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#J00200","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#J00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1395,"content":"<p>I would like to hear a response from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#J00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1396,"content":"<p>As I said, the Bill provides for up to 50%.

First, on the individual complaints mechanism, I have read through the amendments and it seems very vague on the powers of the media commission to force the big tech companies to deal with an actual complaint.  I refer to amendment No. 118 which refers to the new section 139T(1)(a).  It mentions \"referring the complaint to the provider concerned with such advice, guidance or support as the Commission considers appropriate\".  In terms of a complaint, going to the big tech companies in relation to the provision of advice or guidance is far too weak.  All of us here and many of our constituents have had personal experience of dealing with the tech companies.  Any individual who is unfortunate enough to have had a run-in with a tech company knows they are not that interested in what a complainant has to say.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to make a clarification on the powers that the media commission has to force the tech companies to act on a complaint when a genuine complaint is being made.<\/p><p> The second issue I want to raise also concerns the powers of the commission.  It relates to the right to be forgotten.  In the Minister's contribution on section 7, she made the point that one of the first aspects of the media fund that is going to be looked at is the issue of court reporting.  One of the key purposes of court reporting is to report in  public what has gone on in court.  Court hearings are supposed to be held in public and the reports are supposed to be published for that reason.  There have been a number of instances where Google has used the right to be forgotten to actually expunge the public record in relation to convicted sex offenders.  I believe that for the sake of victims who have lived with the consequences of these perpetrators, and that of any potential future victims, those convicted of sexual offences should lose the right to be forgotten on a permanent basis.  Google should not facilitate the deletion of these records.  The law on GDPR clearly states that companies like Google have a legitimate reason for rejecting requests for the erasure of such records when it is in the public interest.  I believe that above all areas where it is in the public interest, records of conviction for sexual offences should remain available to search via Google or any other search engine.  Those records should never be delisted.  Yet, the big tech companies are doing this.  I believe that the commission has a role to play here in ensuring that companies such as Google protect the court records, ensure that they are searchable and accessible, and that where victims waive the right of anonymity, the very last thing that should happen is that a tech company down the road decides that it is going to delist that particular record.  That is a further abuse of the victims involved.  I ask the Minister to look at the issue in advance on Report Stage of this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#L01300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":1437,"content":"<p>Deputy Niamh Smyth resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1438,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#M00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1439,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, the online safety codes deal with the rules on complaints handling.

In this instance, it concerns the issue, as someone described it to me, of the decapitated teddy bear that appears on the television every now and again.  When the map of Ireland appears, suddenly a whole section is removed and the Six Counties do not exist for the purposes of weather forecasts and other programmes.  There must be a duty to ensure that the island as a whole is reflected in weather forecasts.  People may wish to ignore it, but Ireland is still an island.  We should not leave a blank space there.  The Six Counties have not disappeared or gone into space.  One of the other amendments that was ruled out of order addresses the issue of geoblocking and the RT&Eacute; Player service not extending to parts of the Six Counties.  The purpose of amendment No. 45 is to ensure that the national public service broadcaster will have a duty to reflect the island as a whole, and that any graphic or pictorial representation will be faithful, as it were, to the island of Ireland as a geographical whole.  As I have said, this amendment is an attempt on our part to ensure that that is reflected.  People have been raising the issue for many years.  Parts of Ireland disappear as if they do not exist.  In the case of geoblocking, those who are accepted as part of the Irish nation under the Constitution have no rights.  I do not live in the Border region, but as other Deputies here will be able to attest to, there needs to be a proper approach on a national basis to prevent restrictions and ensure that broadcasting continues throughout the island and that no mechanism is put in place that restricts the national broadcasters from one part of the island to the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#M01100","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1446,"content":"<p>As I noted when this issue was raised in the Seanad, I understand the intention of the amendment and why it is troubling for people living on the island of Ireland watching the public service broadcasters to see their part of the island of Ireland removed from maps.

The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 39:  \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo;<b>Duties to the Irish Language<\/b> <blockquote> \t<b>39A<\/b>.(1) All audiovisual media service providers and sound media broadcasters in the State have a duty to support the promotion of the Irish language as the national language.<br \/><br \/>(2) The Commission shall examine the feasibility and merit of setting mandatory minimum content requirements for percentage of content in the Irish language through the awarding of television programme contract and sound broadcast contract licences to be introduced by 31 December 2030, with a higher obligation for public service broadcasters and local broadcasters service Gaeltacht areas, and with a view towards progressively increasing these content requirements over the periods from 2030 to 2035 and again from 2035 to 2040.  The Commission shall publish a report no later than one year following its establishment, which shall be laid before the Minister, both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the Joint Oireachtas Committee, outlining the findings of this examination and proposing recommendations for the implementation of such mandatory minimum content requirements for the Irish language.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>These amendments, as the Chairperson said, are related.  Amendment No. 48 seeks a requirement for a certain percentage of broadcasting to be done as Gaeilge.  Amendment No. 62 seeks to ensure a certain percentage of the music broadcast is in the Irish language or of European origin.  Amendment No. 64 relates to a provision that may have been overtaken by Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  That amendment would require 20% of advertising to be as Gaeilge.  Beyond that, we have a report that proposes a move for between 50% and 100% of the advertising on TG4 in particular to be as Gaeilge.  I will go through these amendments, bit by bit.  Amendment No. 84 is the one from Cumann na Gaeilge.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 48 concerns setting a minimum percentage of the content of television or sound broadcasting to be as Gaeilge.  Over the years, we have found that those who were meant, or promised, to ensure a certain percentage never achieved it.  That includes the State broadcasters other than TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  The proposal is that the commission would examine this issue, come back within a certain period of time and thereafter set five-year targets, if that is acceptable.  It proposes that the commission would publish a report within a year, which could open a discussion about feasibility.  Television and radio broadcasters operate under a licence.  It is not an open licence.  Because the State is granting the licence, it can set conditions.  As I said earlier about another amendment, broadcasters accept those conditions.  Those are the conditions on which they were granted the licence and they are meant to deliver on them.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 62 speaks in some ways to something Deputy Canney and others mentioned earlier.  I have another amendment too.  This amendment intends to encourage Irish traditional music by ensuring that a percentage of air time is reserved for it.  The threshold is set quite low as the amendment would require at least 5% to be reserved for musical composition containing lyrics mostly in the Irish language by 2025, with that increasing to 10% by 2030.  It is to ensure that the content being broadcast fulfils those criteria as a condition of a licence being granted.  It would be a means of promoting Irish musicians and ensuring that they benefit.<\/p><p>The amendment also seeks to ensure that lyrics are not only in the English language.  There is an element intended to ensure we have music from within the EU in order to diversify the content on radio stations.  It would ensure that lyrical content is not only in English, as we have seen on some channels.  In many cases, not only do the presenters speak English but the music they present is entirely in the English language.  Many of our communities, therefore, do not experience a lot of the music one would hear on the Continent.  On the Continent, members of the younger generation in particular switch between languages.  There is a predominance of English among teenage and youthful audiences but there are fantastic musicians who cannot be heard on Irish radio.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 64 relates to a matter that is a bugbear for many who love and enjoy TG4.  Their frustration is that they are listening and immersed in TG4 before all of a sudden, because of a need for commercially viable, advertising is, in some instances, fully as B&eacute;arla.  That is fine for some people who can switch between languages but others find that frustrating and it takes them a while to refocus.  There is a question as to whether an Irish-language broadcaster should be broadcasting anything in English.  I raised that point when I met representatives of TG4 recently.  They told me there would be a cost involved but not necessarily a cost on the television station.  The cost would fall to those making the advertising.  Having spoken to people within the advertising industry, they understand, given what is coming down the track in respect of the Official Languages Act, there will be an increase in funding for Irish-language advertising.  They would consider that an incentive.  This amendment is intended to ensure the incentive is more than just a few extra advertisements on TG4.  It seeks to ensure that TG4 can demand or request of its advertisers that they produce advertisements in Irish.  That can include voice-overs when the content is made initially and advertising with no words at all, which many of the clever advertisers are doing at the moment.<\/p><p>Once advertisers know this, it is a lot cheaper to do initially when they are putting an advertisement together rather than having to recast or dub over it.  If they understood that this was a requirement under legislation, they would definitely refocus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#O01200","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1472,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 48, 62, 64 and 84 would have the effect of setting quotas for the provision of broadcast content and the proportion of advertisements that must be in the Irish language.  Deputies may be aware that a number of amendments were proposed on Seanad Committee and Report Stages regarding gender- and nationality-based quotas in respect of musical works on sound broadcasting services and a quota for participation on news and current affairs programmes.  I indicated to Senators at the time that I would carefully consider those proposals.<\/p><p>On foot of legal advice from the Attorney General on the proposed quotas considered on foot of the Seanad Stages of the Bill, I decided not to introduce any provision for them here on Committee Stage.  Instead, the Government agreed that an amendment should be drafted to provide that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services, and to promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services.  I intend to introduce these amendments on Report Stage.  I raise this now in this context because the advice of the Attorney General has a bearing on my approach to the issue of placing binding quotas for certain types of content in primary legislation.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 48<b><\/b>seeks to impose a general duty on audiovisual media service providers and sound broadcasters in the State to promote the Irish language and requires coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to examine the feasibility and merit of setting out minimum requirements for the provision of content in the Irish language through television programme service and sound broadcasting contracts.  As Deputies will be aware, the duties placed on broadcasters through Chapter 2 of Part 3B of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by section 9, are intended to protect the rights of audiences and individuals rather than to compel broadcasters to take a particular action.<\/p><p>On quotas, as the advice received from the Attorney General in respect of gender-based quotas I referred to earlier indicates, there are a series of complex legal questions associated with quotas relating to competition law and freedom of expression.  There are already clear avenues for us to take action to support Irish language programming through increased funding and supports.  For example, I have increased funding for TG4 by 40% since I entered office, from &euro;37.2 million in 2020 to &euro;52.2 million in 2023.  I agree that we should explore what further steps should be taken to promote the Irish language.  These could include making express provision through media service codes, as I intend to do on Report Stage, regarding the promotion of gender balance and musical works composed by or performed by women.  However, I do not agree that an amendment requiring a report to be prepared is appropriate, given that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will be undertaking a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system.  I believe that we should await the results of the review and accordingly cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 62 would set a quota on sound broadcasting services regarding time dedicated to music containing lyrics, mostly in the Irish language, from 5% from 2026 rising to 10% from 2031.  The amendment would also provide that 40% of music broadcast in the English language should be reserved for musical works composed by at least one Irish or European Economic Area national.  I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music and compositions performed in Irish on our broadcasting services.  Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world.  As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am keen to ensure appropriate supports are in place to nurture and protect this sector further.<\/p><p>However, following the advice of the Attorney General received regarding gender-based quotas, I am acutely conscious of the legal and other factors that must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing airplay quotas.  I understand the Deputies have drafted the amendment to seek to ensure compliance with EU law, as a language-based airplay quota has been successfully introduced by the French authorities, for example.  From a policy perspective, the potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue, particularly in the context of the current media climate.  I do not think the legal or policy complexities can be resolved in the timeframe of this Bill and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.  However, this is a matter that can be considered in the context of the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 64<b><\/b>would require audiovisual media service providers, including broadcasters, to ensure that at least 20% of advertisements made available on the service would be in the Irish language from 2026.  As I indicated earlier, we have already placed a duty on public bodies to ensure that at least 20% of advertising placed is in the Irish language.  In addition to concerns regarding the legal complexities of any quotas, this amendment may have a number of unintended effects that would require careful consideration.  First, the measure could reduce the revenues that broadcasters could earn if there is not a sufficient supply of Irish language advertising from advertisers to produce content in the Irish language.  For example, if a broadcaster currently broadcasts 95% of advertisements in English, a 20% quota could lead to a significant drop in advertising revenue, if advertisers do not first correspondingly increase their production of Irish language advertising and price it accordingly.  There is also a risk that there comes to be, in effect, two advertising pricing structures, one for English language advertising and one for Irish language advertising.  Second, given the country-of-origin principle that underpins the audiovisual media services directive, this requirement could only apply to audiovisual media service providers registered or licensed here in Ireland.  Accordingly, services regulated in other member states that target Irish audiences would not be bound by the quota, potentially increasing their share of revenue earned from advertising<i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>Irish services.  As the broadcasting sector in particular already faces significant challenges to advertising revenues due to the change in ways that content is consumed, I am of the view significant analysis and consultation with stakeholders would be required before considering such a change.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 84<b><\/b>would require that sound broadcasting service contracts and television programme service contracts include a provision requiring broadcasters to provide at least 30 minutes of programming in Irish between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  I will not accept this amendment today.  As with the Deputies' other proposed amendments, this is a matter that could be considered by the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system that will be undertaken by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#P00200","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1473,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response, some of which I was aware of when I put the amendments together.  Again, these amendments are borne out of frustration.  For instance, the BAI had the duty to ensure local broadcasters, even in Gaeltacht areas, had special regard to the needs of the Irish language community.  We know from the report by Dr. John Walsh and Dr. Rosemary Day that Galway Bay FM broadcast 0% in Irish, even though it broadcasts in Gaeltacht areas, and nothing was done about it.  This amendment is about trying to ensure, at minimum, that there would be a target that is implementable and a body, in this case an coimisi&uacute;n, that could ensure that would happen.  Dr. Walsh and Dr. Day produced a comprehensive report on the level of Irish language broadcasting by broadcasters, in particular, local broadcasters, throughout the country.  These broadcasters knowingly accepted their licences and were encouraged over the years to increase the very minimal amount of Irish language broadcasting they were producing, whether they were transmitting Irish traditional music, Irish language music or other music.<\/p> <p>  From meetings of this committee and previous committees, other Deputies will know of discussions on how we ensure local and national broadcasters broadcast our own music.

I do not know if the French are getting away with it or if they have a better understanding of EU law than we have.

as being potentially contrary to the principles of freedom of expression.  I committed to examining the matter.  Having examined and considered the matter, I am proposing amendment No. 59 to qualify the standard applied to broadcasters and providers of video-on-demand services from &ldquo;offence&rdquo; to one of &ldquo;undue offence&rdquo;.

This principle of rights balancing is recognised in Irish law, EU law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.

I read section 46L(7) as saying RT&Eacute; can waive the 20% requirement of a news service across its seven radio stations, namely, Radio 1, 2FM, Lyric FM, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, Gold, Pulse and 2XM.  That was never the intention of legislation in this area.  It is important all of the national broadcast stations run news content and that it is news content relevant to their particular audience.  The last thing we need is a situation where we have national broadcast stations devoid of news content or where there is uniform news content across a number of channels.  Each of these stations specifically targets a particular section of the population and it is imperative that news content is targeted at each particular section.  With the way technology has gone now, this may be the only independent, unbiased news content these particular listeners get.  My reading of this legislation as drafted is that RT&Eacute;, by carrying its news content on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, would not have to provide news content on the likes of 2FM.  Every single person who pays for a TV licence would be very concerned to think a news channel targeted at young people would not have a news service and one that is specifically targeted at its audience and listenership.  I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify this.  I hope I am wrong in my interpretation but clarity is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#R01500","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1520,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his amendment.  Section 46L(5) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, seeks to reflect the current policy regarding the requirement for sound broadcasting services to devote a set amount of broadcast time to news and current affairs programmes.  This is subject to a derogation that may be issued by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to a licensed radio service.  This derogation is currently exercised by the BAI with radio stations such as Christmas FM.<\/p> <p>  The amendment brought by Deputies Naughten and Canney would remove section 46L(7), which provides that the various radio services provided by RT&Eacute; are covered as one radio service for the purposes of the news and current affairs requirement.  As Deputies are aware, RT&Eacute; radio services are not licensed by the BAI, nor will they be licensed by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  Instead, RT&Eacute; services are subject to extensive statutory duties set out in Part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Accordingly, it is not possible for the BAI, and will not be possible for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, to offer a derogation to RT&Eacute; from the requirement to set aside a minimum amount of time to news and current affairs programming.  For that reason, the Bill provides that RT&Eacute; services may be considered as one service for the purposes of the minimum requirements.  If the Bill did not have this provision, Lyric FM would be subject to the minimum requirement as much as Radio 1, with no recourse for a derogation, unlike all other radio services.  This would have negative implications for both RT&Eacute; and audiences, who currently have considerable choice across RT&Eacute; services, while being well served by news and current affairs programming.  That is why I cannot accept this amendment.  The practical effect of the amendment would be to require more news bulletins on, for example, Lyric FM.  In the longer term that would create a disproportionate requirement on RT&Eacute; which, unlike licensed broadcasters, would be unable to avail of this derogation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#R01600","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1521,"content":"<p>Therefore what I am saying is correct.

Due to algorithms, the only other news content young people get is in a news bubble.  The only way they are going to get unbiased news content about what is going on in the country may be through this particular channel and the Minister is now giving RT&Eacute; a waiver for that.  This is bad for democracy.  It is bad for the social cohesion of the country and we are treading a very dangerous avenue by going down this route.

This amendment does not leave that legal requirement in place.  That is a very dangerous road to go down.  We are saying RT&Eacute; can provide its news content by increasing the amount of news content on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, which has a lot of news and current affairs content anyway, and that can cover the requirement to provide it on the likes of 2FM.

In this case we propose a levy which could be imposed on music sharing and sound streaming media platforms such as Spotify.  The levy would be used to fund a scheme to be administered by the Arts Council to support the creation, production and performance of Irish music and programming of traditional sound broadcasting services such as radio stations that air Irish music.  The Minister mentioned the sound and vision fund.  This would probably complement that if we put a levy on the likes of Spotify, although I am not picking on Spotify only.  There are quite a number of platforms.  Similar to amendment No. 62 which was already discussed, we are not limiting this to Irish language music but also including music of Irish cultural expression, in line with the criteria used in Canada, which are music, artist, performance and lyrics, MAPL, which would cover music and lyrics composed by a resident on the island of Ireland, in this case an artist resident on the island, or a performance recorded in Ireland.  There are measures already used for rights when music is played, but artists from elsewhere in the European Union, because we are in the European Union, would not be excluded from receiving this funding as long as they perform in Ireland or performed music composed by an Irish resident.  This is to ensure we are in compliance with any EU rules or directives.<\/p><p>The aim is to address three problems.  The first is that musicians are struggling.  This gives them a bit more bargaining power and allows them to earn more because their music will be played, the idea being to encourage the playing of their music or for them to have access to funding from the fund created by this levy.  Second, radio stations are struggling to compete against the likes of Spotify and others.  There is an over-reliance on commercially produced music from America and Britain.  I discussed this earlier.  There is not a clear Irish identity.  This would encourage local radio stations to play local musicians and there would be financial reward for those musicians.  Third, a massive amount of money from those listening to Irish music leaves these shores to go to streaming services which have no loyalty to Ireland, as money has no loyalty once it goes into the commercial sphere.  This is a way of ensuring they pay a dividend.  The amendment sets a 20% levy.  Some might argue that is too high.  We could start at a lower rate.  This is based on discussions over the years going back to former Deputy Willie Penrose, which is neither today or yesterday, arguing for the need for a fund to be ring-fenced to ensure we can protect Irish musicians, encourage them and ensure their music is heard in Ireland at the same level, if at all possible, as some music which is commercially produced in English and that comes from other jurisdictions such as the United States and Britain.  Now, with Britain out of the EU, this would be encouraged by the EU and I do not think it would be contrary to any EU legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#S01000","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1534,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendments.  As I understand it, the purpose of the amendment is, first, to allow coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to identify and designate providers of what are referred to as sound streaming media and music sharing platform services; second, to provide for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to impose a levy of 20% on the revenues of those providers earned in the State; and third, for the proceeds of the levy to be granted to the Arts Council for the purposes of making schemes to support the production of Irish music.<\/p><p> As the committee knows, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am firmly committed to supporting Irish art and artists, including musicians, across all practices.  That is why I brought forward the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will provide &euro;325 per week to support 2,000 artists, including 584 musicians over three years, and allocated an additional &euro;2 million to the sound and vision scheme to support the live music-related programming this year.  I understand the intention of the amendment is to raise further funds to support the Irish artists.  I also understand the concerns that have been raised by musicians and artists regarding their remuneration for content consumed through music streaming services.  This is a complex area and, in the first instance, I would emphasise that copyright law is a matter for Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p><p> The committee will understand why I cannot accept this amendment.  It represents a major policy departure requiring extensive analysis and consideration, with a number of complex legal and policy questions that need to be addressed.  I would have a number of specific concerns regarding the amendment being proposed here.  First, I note there is no explicit legal basis in EU law for such as levy.  As Deputies are aware, the revised audiovisual media services directive applies to audiovisual broadcasters, video on demand services and video sharing platform services.  The provisions in Article 13(2) of the directive, which provide the legal basis for the content production levy contained in this Bill, are directed at audiovisual broadcasters and video on demand services.  In particular, the innovation of Article 13(2) of the directive is explicitly to permit the levying of video on demand services targeting audiences in the State.  Second, it is unclear whether net revenue is intended to be analogous to taxable profit under the tax code or refers to post-tax revenue.  In either case, what is being proposed appears to be similar to the current corporation tax, albeit that it seeks to tax revenue that is earned by a service.  I would note, in that context, that the rate proposed is considerably higher than the current rate of corporation tax.  It would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider a levy on net revenue in the first instance.  Finally, the proposal would appear to target only those sound streaming services that are under the jurisdiction of the State, which I take to mean are established here.  Accordingly, the levy would not appear to apply to the major services located outside the State.  There is a risk then that those services currently established here would simply seek to relocate to another member state to avoid the levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#S01100","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":1536,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment.
