Members will be aware that this is the first of three sessions scheduled for today and tomorrow for Committee Stage consideration of the Bill.  Members will note it is proposed there will be an hour-long suspension tomorrow from 4.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. because the session is quite long.  We will start at 1.30 p.m. and finish at 8.30 p.m.  I welcome the Minister and her officials and I thank my colleagues for joining us at this late hour.  As we know, Leinster House is alive until all hours and time does not matter.  I remind our officials that they are not in a position to speak while we are in public session.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that in order to participate in a division in committee, members must be physically present in the committee room.  Where members wish to speak to certain sections of the Bill, especially those to which no amendments have been tabled, I request that they clearly indicate before I dispose of the section.  It is useful to note that only matters raised on Committee Stage may be raised by way of amendment on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing via Microsoft Teams for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report, to mute their microphones when not contributing in order to reduce background noise and feedback and to use the raise-hand function if they wish to contribute.  I also ask everyone to ensure their phones are switched off or on airplane mode.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will make some introductory remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#A00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":6,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta a bheith ag labhairt leis na comhalta&iacute; inniu.  Go dt&iacute; seo, m&aacute; bh&iacute; rialach&aacute;n ar bith i gceist, bh&iacute; s&eacute; d&eacute;anta ag na comhlachta&iacute; n&oacute; na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta iad f&eacute;in.  Ar bhealach t&aacute; s&eacute; thar am go nd&eacute;anfaimid a leith&eacute;id.<\/p> <p>  The members all know how important this Bill is in a range of ways.  It is important to our economy in promising to deliver on a modern regulatory system for a crucial business sector.  It is important for our society in providing safety and security for people as they seek to benefit from the considerable opportunities provided by the Internet.  It is most important, however, for our children.  We can all acknowledge how important it is to be able to protect our children from online harm and empower them to deal with the challenges of an online society.  I propose a range of amendments in three categories.  The first is on foot of issues raised in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and on which I committed to act.  The second is amendments to provide for the individual complaints mechanism and the third is amendments required for technical reasons.  The Government approved the amendments on 18 October.<\/p> <p>  The expert group report on the individual complaints mechanism was published on 20 September.  The group ultimately concluded that the complaints mechanism was feasible and, on foot of that, the appropriate amendments have been drafted.  The amendments ensure that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n has a legal basis to begin phasing in a robust individual complaints mechanism in the coming years which will initially focus on children and a number of non-offence-specific categories of harmful online content such as cyberbullying.<\/p> <p>  Another amendment is designed to provide for the inclusion of further forms of offence-specific harmful online content under Schedule 3 of the Bill.  This further content relates to the criminal offence of flashing under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  The amendments will allow the online safety commissioner to appropriately deal with online content related to the offence of flashing through systemic regulations.  Other important changes are amendments to ensure the inclusion of local broadcasters in the scheme to support professional journalistic practices and to provide clarity on when coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may dismiss certain complaints.<\/p> <p>  I know that members of the committee have proposed a range of amendments on a range of issues and I look forward to the debate.  I intend to bring a number of amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  The first group of amendments will be to section 53, specifically those provisions that relate to the content production scheme.  I am conscious that Deputies have proposed their own Committee Stage amendments to section 53, some of which relate to matters that I have been considering for some time.  I look forward to discussing them in detail with Deputies and indicating how I will seek to address those issues on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I intend to bring an amendment to provide that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services and promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services.<\/p> <p>  I intend to bring a number of technical amendments to remove references to the obligation of RT&Eacute; and TG4 to maintain the teletext service.  There is a sense of urgency to this debate, not least in the form of infringement proceedings pending at EU level, because we are very motivated to formally establish coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and empower and resource it to start its important work.  Our debates and discussions since the publication of the Bill in January are really only the beginning.

It is the same for amendment No. 5, which would use \"coimisin&eacute;ir\" instead of \"commissioner\".  It might seem a moot point but there is a logic to this, given the change the Minister has accepted but also the changes that will come into effect at some stage.  Maybe the Minister can clarify when alt 9D d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la is going to come into being.  There are a lot of new State companies being created and according to that Act, which was passed by the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President, all future State companies should be known in the Irish language.  That is some of the logic behind these two amendments.  That references section 9D of the amended Official Languages Act, which I believed at the time indicated there would be a different approach to the titles of organisations.  That has happened in this instance but, logically, the first language should also be used when referring to it in law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#A00800","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; &Oacute; Snodaigh, Munster agus Mythen as a gcuid leasuithe.

When I established the expert group earlier this year I made it clear that if it was feasible to introduce an individual complaints mechanism, I would provide for it in the Bill.  That is what I am proposing to do with these amendments.  The expert group has done its work and has given detailed consideration to the wide range of issues raised in the context of an individual complaints mechanism, including through a public consultation and engagement with experts such as the Australian e-safety commissioner.  The expert group&rsquo;s report and recommendations chart a practical way forward for the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism, focused on operationalising the mechanism on a phased basis and firstly for children.  These amendments were drafted on the basis of the heads contained in the expert group&rsquo;s report and they hew closely to the expert group&rsquo;s recommendations, save for necessary legal adjustments by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p><p>In this regard, amendment No. 118 provides for the substantive provisions for the phasing in and operation of an individual complaints mechanism, including how an coimisi&uacute;n can make schemes for complaints about various kinds of harmful online content; the threshold that must be met before an coimisi&uacute;n will handle a complaint; the kinds of resolutions for complaints available to an coimisi&uacute;n; a requirement for an coimisi&uacute;n to set out a plan for operationalising these provisions; and a requirement for an coimisi&uacute;n to prioritise operationalising the individual complaints mechanism for children in the first instance.<\/p><p>The remainder of the amendments in this grouping - amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, 43, 82, 108, 118 to 120, inclusive, 124 to 128, inclusive, 130 to 136, inclusive, 146, 148 to 256, inclusive, 258 to 264, inclusive, 266 to 269, inclusive, 272 to 292, inclusive, 317 and 318 - are consequential to amendment No. 118 and relate to the necessary renumbering of sections throughout the Bill to account for the insertion of amendment No. 118.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B00900","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten looks worried that we will be here all night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01000","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I nearly had a full house there with all those numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, line 34, to delete &ldquo;section 139ZZ(2)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 139ZZH(2)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, line 36, to delete &ldquo;section 139ZZ(3)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 139ZZH(3)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01500","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 6, to delete &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Coimisin&eacute;ir&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01700","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 9, 10, 137 and 265 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#B01900","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6: <\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 30, to delete &ldquo;definition&rdquo; where it firstly occurs and substitute &ldquo;definitions&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>These are purely technical amendments inserting a definition of the e-commerce directive into section 2 of the 2009 Act, which concerns definitions.

For many years, the debate has been focused on the failure of our State broadcaster to fully carry out its duty under the Constitution to promote the Irish language and do more to ensure that our traditions are promoted.

In 2023, that allocation will be &euro;52.2 million, which is an increase of just over 40% over a three-year period.

Therefore, if we put any provisions and additions on top of the duties and responsibilities of commercial media they get on with it.  They understand that is a duty to allow them to continue to broadcast and operate in the State.  It should not be seen as a duty but in some ways as just one of those issues they must comply with.  In this case it is a positive duty they would have to ensure the promotion of the Irish language and our traditions.  If we were to leave this on the exact same footing as all other languages in the country there is a danger the Irish language and its traditions will remain as an afterthought for many of the media.

As I have previously indicated, the BAI is specified as a public body in the First Schedule of the Act and so, by virtue of the transitional provisions of the Bill, coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will be considered a public body under the Act.

I would note that the recruitment booklet for the role of media development commissioner advertised in July identified competency in the Irish language as a desirable quality.<\/p> <p>  As the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee continues its work over the coming years, consideration could be given to requiring competency in the Irish language for one of the commissioner posts.  However, it is important that we retain flexibility in this regard to ensure the widest array of candidates are available on establishment of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  Accordingly, the best way to provide for that recruitment is through the recruitment process for commissioners rather than in legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#F01400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Tuigim an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an tAire &oacute; thaobh leas&uacute; Uimh. 28 agus t&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta &eacute; sin a tharraingt siar.<\/p><p>&Oacute; thaobh na dh&aacute; leasuithe eile, m&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag glacadh leis an loighic at&aacute; taobh thiar den strait&eacute;is at&aacute; leagtha s&iacute;os againn &oacute; thaobh an St&aacute;it de agus &oacute; thaobh Achta na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;) 2021 de, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh muid ag dul chun cinn agus ag d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go mbeadh n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in desirable attribute ag na heagrais St&aacute;it ar fad &oacute; th&uacute;s &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de ach, toisc go bhfuil g&aacute; docht daingean ann, go mbeadh Gaeilge ag an gcathaoirleach ach go h&aacute;irithe.

As the officials will know, this is an issue that was discussed at length a number of years ago.  The intention was to reduce the levy to the independent broadcasters, in recognition of the public service remit they are providing through the radio stations.  The rules in Standing Orders mean it is not possible for me to table such an amendment here as it would be ruled out of order by the Chair, so I have used this mechanism to raise this issue with the Minister in the hope she can indicate that she is prepared to look again at the broadcasting levy.<\/p><p>One of the big problems with the broadcasting levy as it is structured is that it is regressive and disproportionate, particularly for smaller radio stations.  They are the ones that are struggling to remain viable and yet they are the most important aspect of the broadcasting network at local level throughout the country.  We have taken the decision, and rightly so, to waive the fees for community radio stations.  We are unique globally in having a thriving community radio station network.  It is a positive development that we are waiving those fees.  With the way the levy is calculated currently, all broadcasters, regardless of size or turnover, pay the same percentage on the first tranche of money.  Following that, the more money a broadcaster makes, the less of a percentage they pay on those higher amounts.  It disproportionately penalises the smaller stations.  The intention behind this is to give recognition to the public information role provided by radio stations.<\/p><p>This came to the fore during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  Storm Ophelia was the high winds of 2017, which led to a tragic loss of life.  A huge amount of our electricity network throughout the country was disrupted, and that had a knock-on impact on broadband and mobile phone coverage.  The only way the State could get vital public information out to communities throughout this country was through local radio stations and the local radio network.  The same happened with Storm Emma, or the beast from the east as it was called, in spring 2018.  A huge amount of our existing infrastructure was brought down, and we are becoming more reliant on broadband and electricity.  One is co-dependent on the other.  If electricity goes, our broadband and mobile networks go, and as a result of that the only mechanism to get a message across to the public is through our local radio stations.<\/p><p>When we do the be winter-ready campaign, one of the elements in relation to that should be to actively encourage people to have an old radio and a set of batteries so that they can tune in to the local radio station and get updates on the return of electricity, on water supplies, emergency services and where services can be availed of, because it is only on a local radio station that such a level of information can be given out.  During those two especially severe weather events, we were all so dependent on our local radio stations to give us vital information.  RT&Eacute; and the national broadcasters were great, but they were not going to be able to tell a rural townland in County Roscommon or County Galway when their electricity was likely to be back.  They could not go into that level of detail.  However, the local radio station could and did give it.  That must be recognised.  There should be recognition in terms of a reduction in the broadcasting levy.  That was before we saw the financial impact of Covid-19 on many broadcasters.  Many of the smaller ones now are struggling at this stage.  They are the ones that are so vital across many rural areas.  Could the Minister look at the proposals and commitments that have been given previously for a reduction in the broadcasting levy, and provide us with clarity and an intention to come back on Report Stage to amend the legislation in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#G01100","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I support my colleague, Deputy Naughten, in what he said.  I reiterate that in a constituency like Galway East, where we have had a significant amount of flooding for a long period and where many local roads were blocked, local radio proved to be a vital information tool to direct people on how to access their homes, to know where to go and what was going on in terms of electricity cuts.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  The other benefit provided by local radio stations is the local connection for people who are at home who want to listen to their local club match on the radio and to hear how things are going every Saturday and Sunday evening.  A great service is being provided by local radio stations.  They are very much part of the fabric of society, especially in rural areas.  Where people cannot go to matches or local mass, they can hear coverage on the radio.  All of that kind of service is now provided by local radio stations and we take it for granted now.  The industry is under severe pressure and this would be an indication that we do support it and that we recognise the service they provide, which goes beyond what any national broadcaster will ever be able to do.  For that reason, it is so important that we support local radio stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#H00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The previous speakers have already covered it, but I want to add my voice to the fact that there is a strong argument for a reduction in the levy given the function and role of local radio and the service provided to local communities the length and breadth of the State, both from an information point of view and in terms of the public service remit.  We are all aware of local radio stations in our area.  The listenership is of massive proportions.  People might listen to national radio for an hour or so, but inevitably they will always switch back to their local radio for news and, as other speakers have said, for information following storms.  Local radio can offer all of that vital information to local communities.  There is justification for a reduction in the levy, given that they pay the same levy as other stations that have a far bigger listenership and revenue.  It does not seem fair and a reduction in the levy is warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#H00300","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I support the amendment as well.

As they said, the Bill already provides that community broadcasters will not be liable for the industry levy, so this is focused on commercial radio broadcasters.  I value the service being provided by local radio.  I grew up not too far from Deputy Munster and I relied on LMFM and Northern Sound.  I know the value of local radio in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The industry levy contained in section 21 of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, is based on the principle that each category of service pays for the cost of activities related to that service so that there is no cross-subsidisation of one sector by another.  This is an important general regulatory principle and one I do not think we should depart from.  However, it is important to note that the Bill already provides that up to 50% of the cost of regulating broadcasting can be met through the TV licence.  This was carried over from the Broadcasting Bill, which Deputy Naughten in particular progressed.  However, the Deputies will also be aware that a technical working has been established to look at reforms to the TV licence and we must let that group complete its work.  Members will also be aware of the additional funding I mentioned earlier that has been put in place for radio through the sound and vision fund.  These supports will also be available at an increased level through the media fund.

The difficulty I have here is that, as the Minister said, up to 50% of the cost of the levy can be met from the TV licence fee.  That is not to say it will be met from the TV licence fee.  As we all know well, the difficulty is that when the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get their claws into this, nothing will happen.  What we are seeking is greater clarity on the commitment that there is a determination, in particular for the smaller stations, that they would see a reduction in the levy and that there would be a recognition of the important public service role they play.  We have seen at first hand the importance of these stations during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  My fear is that with the commercial squeeze that is being put on many of the smaller radio stations the current disproportionate structure of the broadcasting levy would result in many of them going out of business.  We would see the amalgamation of stations take place that will not be able to give the information, for example, on what went on in Bridgetown, or when the electricity will be back in 50 townlands across a listenership area.  That is the type of detail that was provided during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  It is not possible for RT&Eacute; or regional radio stations to give that level of detail.  They can advise people to go on to their websites or Twitter accounts for a breakdown in that regard but the reality is that if the electricity to the local mobile phone mast is gone down, and the broadband cable is damaged, along with the electricity cable, people have no Internet.  Any online forum is of no use.  The only way to get a message to people across the board is through the local radio station.<\/p> <p>  We must make sure that those radio stations can survive.  That is why I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  I know her commitment and that of her officials in this regard but I ask her to reconsider this between now and Report Stage to see if we can provide a greater level of assurance and clarity regarding the reduction in the broadcasting levy and ensure that it is far more proportionate and recognises to a far greater extent the vital role played by these local broadcasters across the country in times of emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#H00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The important thing is we catch something in this legislation or some commitment is made rather than leaving it in abeyance, because if it drifts from this legislation and this opportunity, we could rue what we have done.

Even from a music industry point of view, it is very important we take into account the number of local people who get airtime on local stations, which helps their profile and helps develop arts and culture throughout the country at local level.

Many of us in this room have cited those occasions on which local radio becomes vital in terms of communicating directly with local communities.  I hope that in how we look at how we structure and fund the provision of public service news gathering and dissemination in the future, and that is across print and broadcast, we strike that balance to ensure the public service remit of local radio is supported, as we have done recently with our print media.  I hope a similar gesture of support is extended to local broadcasters.  It is vital this happens.  They have that public service remit and within the broader spectrum of supporting public service news gathering and dissemination and in acknowledgement of the very difficult financial circumstances in which the vast majority find themselves haemorrhaging advertising revenue to social media platforms.

First, on the individual complaints mechanism, I have read through the amendments and it seems very vague on the powers of the media commission to force the big tech companies to deal with an actual complaint.  I refer to amendment No. 118 which refers to the new section 139T(1)(a).  It mentions \"referring the complaint to the provider concerned with such advice, guidance or support as the Commission considers appropriate\".  In terms of a complaint, going to the big tech companies in relation to the provision of advice or guidance is far too weak.  All of us here and many of our constituents have had personal experience of dealing with the tech companies.  Any individual who is unfortunate enough to have had a run-in with a tech company knows they are not that interested in what a complainant has to say.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to make a clarification on the powers that the media commission has to force the tech companies to act on a complaint when a genuine complaint is being made.<\/p><p> The second issue I want to raise also concerns the powers of the commission.  It relates to the right to be forgotten.  In the Minister's contribution on section 7, she made the point that one of the first aspects of the media fund that is going to be looked at is the issue of court reporting.  One of the key purposes of court reporting is to report in  public what has gone on in court.  Court hearings are supposed to be held in public and the reports are supposed to be published for that reason.  There have been a number of instances where Google has used the right to be forgotten to actually expunge the public record in relation to convicted sex offenders.  I believe that for the sake of victims who have lived with the consequences of these perpetrators, and that of any potential future victims, those convicted of sexual offences should lose the right to be forgotten on a permanent basis.  Google should not facilitate the deletion of these records.  The law on GDPR clearly states that companies like Google have a legitimate reason for rejecting requests for the erasure of such records when it is in the public interest.  I believe that above all areas where it is in the public interest, records of conviction for sexual offences should remain available to search via Google or any other search engine.  Those records should never be delisted.  Yet, the big tech companies are doing this.  I believe that the commission has a role to play here in ensuring that companies such as Google protect the court records, ensure that they are searchable and accessible, and that where victims waive the right of anonymity, the very last thing that should happen is that a tech company down the road decides that it is going to delist that particular record.  That is a further abuse of the victims involved.  I ask the Minister to look at the issue in advance on Report Stage of this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#L01300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Deputy Niamh Smyth resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#M00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, the online safety codes deal with the rules on complaints handling.

In this instance, it concerns the issue, as someone described it to me, of the decapitated teddy bear that appears on the television every now and again.  When the map of Ireland appears, suddenly a whole section is removed and the Six Counties do not exist for the purposes of weather forecasts and other programmes.  There must be a duty to ensure that the island as a whole is reflected in weather forecasts.  People may wish to ignore it, but Ireland is still an island.  We should not leave a blank space there.  The Six Counties have not disappeared or gone into space.  One of the other amendments that was ruled out of order addresses the issue of geoblocking and the RT&Eacute; Player service not extending to parts of the Six Counties.  The purpose of amendment No. 45 is to ensure that the national public service broadcaster will have a duty to reflect the island as a whole, and that any graphic or pictorial representation will be faithful, as it were, to the island of Ireland as a geographical whole.  As I have said, this amendment is an attempt on our part to ensure that that is reflected.  People have been raising the issue for many years.  Parts of Ireland disappear as if they do not exist.  In the case of geoblocking, those who are accepted as part of the Irish nation under the Constitution have no rights.  I do not live in the Border region, but as other Deputies here will be able to attest to, there needs to be a proper approach on a national basis to prevent restrictions and ensure that broadcasting continues throughout the island and that no mechanism is put in place that restricts the national broadcasters from one part of the island to the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#M01100","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>As I noted when this issue was raised in the Seanad, I understand the intention of the amendment and why it is troubling for people living on the island of Ireland watching the public service broadcasters to see their part of the island of Ireland removed from maps.

The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 39:  \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo;<b>Duties to the Irish Language<\/b> <blockquote> \t<b>39A<\/b>.(1) All audiovisual media service providers and sound media broadcasters in the State have a duty to support the promotion of the Irish language as the national language.<br \/><br \/>(2) The Commission shall examine the feasibility and merit of setting mandatory minimum content requirements for percentage of content in the Irish language through the awarding of television programme contract and sound broadcast contract licences to be introduced by 31 December 2030, with a higher obligation for public service broadcasters and local broadcasters service Gaeltacht areas, and with a view towards progressively increasing these content requirements over the periods from 2030 to 2035 and again from 2035 to 2040.  The Commission shall publish a report no later than one year following its establishment, which shall be laid before the Minister, both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the Joint Oireachtas Committee, outlining the findings of this examination and proposing recommendations for the implementation of such mandatory minimum content requirements for the Irish language.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>These amendments, as the Chairperson said, are related.  Amendment No. 48 seeks a requirement for a certain percentage of broadcasting to be done as Gaeilge.  Amendment No. 62 seeks to ensure a certain percentage of the music broadcast is in the Irish language or of European origin.  Amendment No. 64 relates to a provision that may have been overtaken by Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  That amendment would require 20% of advertising to be as Gaeilge.  Beyond that, we have a report that proposes a move for between 50% and 100% of the advertising on TG4 in particular to be as Gaeilge.  I will go through these amendments, bit by bit.  Amendment No. 84 is the one from Cumann na Gaeilge.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 48 concerns setting a minimum percentage of the content of television or sound broadcasting to be as Gaeilge.  Over the years, we have found that those who were meant, or promised, to ensure a certain percentage never achieved it.  That includes the State broadcasters other than TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  The proposal is that the commission would examine this issue, come back within a certain period of time and thereafter set five-year targets, if that is acceptable.  It proposes that the commission would publish a report within a year, which could open a discussion about feasibility.  Television and radio broadcasters operate under a licence.  It is not an open licence.  Because the State is granting the licence, it can set conditions.  As I said earlier about another amendment, broadcasters accept those conditions.  Those are the conditions on which they were granted the licence and they are meant to deliver on them.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 62 speaks in some ways to something Deputy Canney and others mentioned earlier.  I have another amendment too.  This amendment intends to encourage Irish traditional music by ensuring that a percentage of air time is reserved for it.  The threshold is set quite low as the amendment would require at least 5% to be reserved for musical composition containing lyrics mostly in the Irish language by 2025, with that increasing to 10% by 2030.  It is to ensure that the content being broadcast fulfils those criteria as a condition of a licence being granted.  It would be a means of promoting Irish musicians and ensuring that they benefit.<\/p><p>The amendment also seeks to ensure that lyrics are not only in the English language.  There is an element intended to ensure we have music from within the EU in order to diversify the content on radio stations.  It would ensure that lyrical content is not only in English, as we have seen on some channels.  In many cases, not only do the presenters speak English but the music they present is entirely in the English language.  Many of our communities, therefore, do not experience a lot of the music one would hear on the Continent.  On the Continent, members of the younger generation in particular switch between languages.  There is a predominance of English among teenage and youthful audiences but there are fantastic musicians who cannot be heard on Irish radio.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 64 relates to a matter that is a bugbear for many who love and enjoy TG4.  Their frustration is that they are listening and immersed in TG4 before all of a sudden, because of a need for commercially viable, advertising is, in some instances, fully as B&eacute;arla.  That is fine for some people who can switch between languages but others find that frustrating and it takes them a while to refocus.  There is a question as to whether an Irish-language broadcaster should be broadcasting anything in English.  I raised that point when I met representatives of TG4 recently.  They told me there would be a cost involved but not necessarily a cost on the television station.  The cost would fall to those making the advertising.  Having spoken to people within the advertising industry, they understand, given what is coming down the track in respect of the Official Languages Act, there will be an increase in funding for Irish-language advertising.  They would consider that an incentive.  This amendment is intended to ensure the incentive is more than just a few extra advertisements on TG4.  It seeks to ensure that TG4 can demand or request of its advertisers that they produce advertisements in Irish.  That can include voice-overs when the content is made initially and advertising with no words at all, which many of the clever advertisers are doing at the moment.<\/p><p>Once advertisers know this, it is a lot cheaper to do initially when they are putting an advertisement together rather than having to recast or dub over it.  If they understood that this was a requirement under legislation, they would definitely refocus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#O01200","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 48, 62, 64 and 84 would have the effect of setting quotas for the provision of broadcast content and the proportion of advertisements that must be in the Irish language.  Deputies may be aware that a number of amendments were proposed on Seanad Committee and Report Stages regarding gender- and nationality-based quotas in respect of musical works on sound broadcasting services and a quota for participation on news and current affairs programmes.  I indicated to Senators at the time that I would carefully consider those proposals.<\/p><p>On foot of legal advice from the Attorney General on the proposed quotas considered on foot of the Seanad Stages of the Bill, I decided not to introduce any provision for them here on Committee Stage.  Instead, the Government agreed that an amendment should be drafted to provide that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services, and to promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services.  I intend to introduce these amendments on Report Stage.  I raise this now in this context because the advice of the Attorney General has a bearing on my approach to the issue of placing binding quotas for certain types of content in primary legislation.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 48<b><\/b>seeks to impose a general duty on audiovisual media service providers and sound broadcasters in the State to promote the Irish language and requires coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to examine the feasibility and merit of setting out minimum requirements for the provision of content in the Irish language through television programme service and sound broadcasting contracts.  As Deputies will be aware, the duties placed on broadcasters through Chapter 2 of Part 3B of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by section 9, are intended to protect the rights of audiences and individuals rather than to compel broadcasters to take a particular action.<\/p><p>On quotas, as the advice received from the Attorney General in respect of gender-based quotas I referred to earlier indicates, there are a series of complex legal questions associated with quotas relating to competition law and freedom of expression.  There are already clear avenues for us to take action to support Irish language programming through increased funding and supports.  For example, I have increased funding for TG4 by 40% since I entered office, from &euro;37.2 million in 2020 to &euro;52.2 million in 2023.  I agree that we should explore what further steps should be taken to promote the Irish language.  These could include making express provision through media service codes, as I intend to do on Report Stage, regarding the promotion of gender balance and musical works composed by or performed by women.  However, I do not agree that an amendment requiring a report to be prepared is appropriate, given that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will be undertaking a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system.  I believe that we should await the results of the review and accordingly cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 62 would set a quota on sound broadcasting services regarding time dedicated to music containing lyrics, mostly in the Irish language, from 5% from 2026 rising to 10% from 2031.  The amendment would also provide that 40% of music broadcast in the English language should be reserved for musical works composed by at least one Irish or European Economic Area national.  I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music and compositions performed in Irish on our broadcasting services.  Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world.  As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am keen to ensure appropriate supports are in place to nurture and protect this sector further.<\/p><p>However, following the advice of the Attorney General received regarding gender-based quotas, I am acutely conscious of the legal and other factors that must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing airplay quotas.  I understand the Deputies have drafted the amendment to seek to ensure compliance with EU law, as a language-based airplay quota has been successfully introduced by the French authorities, for example.  From a policy perspective, the potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue, particularly in the context of the current media climate.  I do not think the legal or policy complexities can be resolved in the timeframe of this Bill and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.  However, this is a matter that can be considered in the context of the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 64<b><\/b>would require audiovisual media service providers, including broadcasters, to ensure that at least 20% of advertisements made available on the service would be in the Irish language from 2026.  As I indicated earlier, we have already placed a duty on public bodies to ensure that at least 20% of advertising placed is in the Irish language.  In addition to concerns regarding the legal complexities of any quotas, this amendment may have a number of unintended effects that would require careful consideration.  First, the measure could reduce the revenues that broadcasters could earn if there is not a sufficient supply of Irish language advertising from advertisers to produce content in the Irish language.  For example, if a broadcaster currently broadcasts 95% of advertisements in English, a 20% quota could lead to a significant drop in advertising revenue, if advertisers do not first correspondingly increase their production of Irish language advertising and price it accordingly.  There is also a risk that there comes to be, in effect, two advertising pricing structures, one for English language advertising and one for Irish language advertising.  Second, given the country-of-origin principle that underpins the audiovisual media services directive, this requirement could only apply to audiovisual media service providers registered or licensed here in Ireland.  Accordingly, services regulated in other member states that target Irish audiences would not be bound by the quota, potentially increasing their share of revenue earned from advertising<i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>Irish services.  As the broadcasting sector in particular already faces significant challenges to advertising revenues due to the change in ways that content is consumed, I am of the view significant analysis and consultation with stakeholders would be required before considering such a change.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 84<b><\/b>would require that sound broadcasting service contracts and television programme service contracts include a provision requiring broadcasters to provide at least 30 minutes of programming in Irish between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  I will not accept this amendment today.

Again, these amendments are borne out of frustration.  For instance, the BAI had the duty to ensure local broadcasters, even in Gaeltacht areas, had special regard to the needs of the Irish language community.  We know from the report by Dr. John Walsh and Dr. Rosemary Day that Galway Bay FM broadcast 0% in Irish, even though it broadcasts in Gaeltacht areas, and nothing was done about it.  This amendment is about trying to ensure, at minimum, that there would be a target that is implementable and a body, in this case an coimisi&uacute;n, that could ensure that would happen.  Dr. Walsh and Dr. Day produced a comprehensive report on the level of Irish language broadcasting by broadcasters, in particular, local broadcasters, throughout the country.  These broadcasters knowingly accepted their licences and were encouraged over the years to increase the very minimal amount of Irish language broadcasting they were producing, whether they were transmitting Irish traditional music, Irish language music or other music.<\/p> <p>  From meetings of this committee and previous committees, other Deputies will know of discussions on how we ensure local and national broadcasters broadcast our own music.  These amendments are attempts to reflect, as the Minister mentioned, the French example.<\/p><p>I remember over the years people saying we could not do various things because of EU law, whereas France is doing it.  I do not know if the French are getting away with it or if they have a better understanding of EU law than we have.  Maybe an coimisi&uacute;n can look at it when it is carrying out its comprehensive analysis of Irish broadcasting.  I hope that comprehensive analysis can be completed quite quickly and will have an effect so that it is not necessary for us to come back here in some years' time still frustrated or more frustrated with the lack of progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#P00300","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Section 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 49:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 49, line 33, to delete &ldquo;<b>: &lsquo;relevant media service provider&rsquo;<\/b>&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#Q00500","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 50:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 49, line 34, to delete &ldquo;Part,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Part&mdash;&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#Q00700","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666652400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 51 to 58, inclusive, and 67 to 76, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#Q00900","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 51:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 49, line 34, after &ldquo;Part,&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo; &lsquo;party political programme&rsquo; means a programme broadcast, or made available in a catalogue of an audiovisual on-demand media service, by or on behalf of a political party for the purpose of promoting the political party;<br \/><br \/>&lsquo;political party&rsquo; means a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties;&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>Section 46M(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill as passed by the Seanad, retains the prohibition on advertisements of a political nature and the derogation from that prohibition in the case of &quot;party political programmes&quot;, previously known as &quot;party political broadcasts&quot;.

I committed to examining the matter.

That was never the intention of legislation in this area.  It is important all of the national broadcast stations run news content and that it is news content relevant to their particular audience.  The last thing we need is a situation where we have national broadcast stations devoid of news content or where there is uniform news content across a number of channels.  Each of these stations specifically targets a particular section of the population and it is imperative that news content is targeted at each particular section.  With the way technology has gone now, this may be the only independent, unbiased news content these particular listeners get.  My reading of this legislation as drafted is that RT&Eacute;, by carrying its news content on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, would not have to provide news content on the likes of 2FM.  Every single person who pays for a TV licence would be very concerned to think a news channel targeted at young people would not have a news service and one that is specifically targeted at its audience and listenership.

Section 46L(5) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, seeks to reflect the current policy regarding the requirement for sound broadcasting services to devote a set amount of broadcast time to news and current affairs programmes.  This is subject to a derogation that may be issued by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to a licensed radio service.  This derogation is currently exercised by the BAI with radio stations such as Christmas FM.<\/p> <p>  The amendment brought by Deputies Naughten and Canney would remove section 46L(7), which provides that the various radio services provided by RT&Eacute; are covered as one radio service for the purposes of the news and current affairs requirement.  As Deputies are aware, RT&Eacute; radio services are not licensed by the BAI, nor will they be licensed by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  Instead, RT&Eacute; services are subject to extensive statutory duties set out in Part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Accordingly, it is not possible for the BAI, and will not be possible for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, to offer a derogation to RT&Eacute; from the requirement to set aside a minimum amount of time to news and current affairs programming.  For that reason, the Bill provides that RT&Eacute; services may be considered as one service for the purposes of the minimum requirements.  If the Bill did not have this provision, Lyric FM would be subject to the minimum requirement as much as Radio 1, with no recourse for a derogation, unlike all other radio services.  This would have negative implications for both RT&Eacute; and audiences, who currently have considerable choice across RT&Eacute; services, while being well served by news and current affairs programming.  That is why I cannot accept this amendment.  The practical effect of the amendment would be to require more news bulletins on, for example, Lyric FM.  In the longer term that would create a disproportionate requirement on RT&Eacute; which, unlike licensed broadcasters, would be unable to avail of this derogation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#R01600","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Therefore what I am saying is correct.

Due to algorithms, the only other news content young people get is in a news bubble.

We are saying RT&Eacute; can provide its news content by increasing the amount of news content on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, which has a lot of news and current affairs content anyway, and that can cover the requirement to provide it on the likes of 2FM.  That may be the only independent channel in this jurisdiction from which young people get unbiased news content.  It is not controlled by algorithms and neither should it be.  I urge the Minister again to ensure every single citizen of this country has access to unbiased, fair and equitable news content and ensure that is provided for, which I believe is not the case in the current drafting of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#S00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>We are not changing anything.

In this case we propose a levy which could be imposed on music sharing and sound streaming media platforms such as Spotify.  The levy would be used to fund a scheme to be administered by the Arts Council to support the creation, production and performance of Irish music and programming of traditional sound broadcasting services such as radio stations that air Irish music.  The Minister mentioned the sound and vision fund.  This would probably complement that if we put a levy on the likes of Spotify, although I am not picking on Spotify only.  There are quite a number of platforms.  Similar to amendment No. 62 which was already discussed, we are not limiting this to Irish language music but also including music of Irish cultural expression, in line with the criteria used in Canada, which are music, artist, performance and lyrics, MAPL, which would cover music and lyrics composed by a resident on the island of Ireland, in this case an artist resident on the island, or a performance recorded in Ireland.  There are measures already used for rights when music is played, but artists from elsewhere in the European Union, because we are in the European Union, would not be excluded from receiving this funding as long as they perform in Ireland or performed music composed by an Irish resident.  This is to ensure we are in compliance with any EU rules or directives.<\/p><p>The aim is to address three problems.  The first is that musicians are struggling.  This gives them a bit more bargaining power and allows them to earn more because their music will be played, the idea being to encourage the playing of their music or for them to have access to funding from the fund created by this levy.  Second, radio stations are struggling to compete against the likes of Spotify and others.  There is an over-reliance on commercially produced music from America and Britain.  I discussed this earlier.  There is not a clear Irish identity.  This would encourage local radio stations to play local musicians and there would be financial reward for those musicians.  Third, a massive amount of money from those listening to Irish music leaves these shores to go to streaming services which have no loyalty to Ireland, as money has no loyalty once it goes into the commercial sphere.  This is a way of ensuring they pay a dividend.  The amendment sets a 20% levy.  Some might argue that is too high.  We could start at a lower rate.  This is based on discussions over the years going back to former Deputy Willie Penrose, which is neither today or yesterday, arguing for the need for a fund to be ring-fenced to ensure we can protect Irish musicians, encourage them and ensure their music is heard in Ireland at the same level, if at all possible, as some music which is commercially produced in English and that comes from other jurisdictions such as the United States and Britain.  Now, with Britain out of the EU, this would be encouraged by the EU and I do not think it would be contrary to any EU legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#S01000","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendments.  As I understand it, the purpose of the amendment is, first, to allow coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to identify and designate providers of what are referred to as sound streaming media and music sharing platform services; second, to provide for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to impose a levy of 20% on the revenues of those providers earned in the State; and third, for the proceeds of the levy to be granted to the Arts Council for the purposes of making schemes to support the production of Irish music.<\/p><p> As the committee knows, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am firmly committed to supporting Irish art and artists, including musicians, across all practices.  That is why I brought forward the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will provide &euro;325 per week to support 2,000 artists, including 584 musicians over three years, and allocated an additional &euro;2 million to the sound and vision scheme to support the live music-related programming this year.  I understand the intention of the amendment is to raise further funds to support the Irish artists.  I also understand the concerns that have been raised by musicians and artists regarding their remuneration for content consumed through music streaming services.  This is a complex area and, in the first instance, I would emphasise that copyright law is a matter for Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p><p> The committee will understand why I cannot accept this amendment.  It represents a major policy departure requiring extensive analysis and consideration, with a number of complex legal and policy questions that need to be addressed.  I would have a number of specific concerns regarding the amendment being proposed here.  First, I note there is no explicit legal basis in EU law for such as levy.  As Deputies are aware, the revised audiovisual media services directive applies to audiovisual broadcasters, video on demand services and video sharing platform services.  The provisions in Article 13(2) of the directive, which provide the legal basis for the content production levy contained in this Bill, are directed at audiovisual broadcasters and video on demand services.  In particular, the innovation of Article 13(2) of the directive is explicitly to permit the levying of video on demand services targeting audiences in the State.  Second, it is unclear whether net revenue is intended to be analogous to taxable profit under the tax code or refers to post-tax revenue.  In either case, what is being proposed appears to be similar to the current corporation tax, albeit that it seeks to tax revenue that is earned by a service.  I would note, in that context, that the rate proposed is considerably higher than the current rate of corporation tax.  It would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider a levy on net revenue in the first instance.  Finally, the proposal would appear to target only those sound streaming services that are under the jurisdiction of the State, which I take to mean are established here.  Accordingly, the levy would not appear to apply to the major services located outside the State.  There is a risk then that those services currently established here would simply seek to relocate to another member state to avoid the levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102500002#S01100","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666652400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment.
